 (also known as ), a fictional character, is one of the central characters and the female lead in the anime series ''Mobile Suit Gundam Wing'' and its various spinoffs. She is the younger sister of '''Milliardo Peacecraft''' (AKA Zechs Merquise). 

== Personality ==
Relena is a rather complex character, one who changes throughout the ''Gundam Wing'' series. If Milliardo is to be considered the ''Gundam Wing'' counterpart to Char Aznable, then she would be the perfect counterpart for Sayla Mass. She begins the series as a lonely young woman, hiding her true feelings behind a mask of detached politeness.  Her initial encounters with Heero Yuy, possibly the first truly honest person she's ever met, lead to her casting off her routine life in order to understand the alien world from which the young Gundam Pilot comes.  

As the series progresses, Relena does her best to become more worldly and knowledgeable, despite the fact that she is still a fifteen-year-old girl.  Given the responsibilities of leading a nation, and then the entire world, Relena was forced to grow up rather quickly; as a result, when she appears in the movie ''Endless Waltz'', she displays an incredible amount of confidence and competence for someone her age.

There are several elements of Relena's character which remain constant, however.  One is her idealism; once she learns of her true heritage as a Peacecraft, she does all she can to bring her father's Total Pacifism to the world, no matter how many people consider her naïve and how utterly hard it is to bring their theories to the practice.  Similarly, Relena is portrayed as very compassionate, always looking out for the well-being of others before her own.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Relena has a fiery determination and bravery that she brings to everything she believes in.  When her homeland is under attack, she refuses to back down even as enemies attack the very building she is standing in, but finally gives in when she realizes that innocent people are being hurt in the crossfire.  In Endless Waltz, she risks death by stealing one of the enemy force's broadcasts to urge the citizens to stand up to the invaders.  When staring down the barrel of Dekim Barton's pistol, she defiantly declares that she's prepared to die for her beliefs if need be.

Relena is often portrayed as an intellectual; she is well-read and enjoys chess.  A conversation with Pagan early on suggests that she is a fan of suspense-thriller novels.

== History ==

===Origins===
Relena was born in April 7, AC 180, and is the daughter of Sanc Kingdom rulers, King Peacecraft and his wife, Queen Katrina, who adopted the original Heero Yuy's "Total Pacifism" beliefs for Earth. But in AC 182, the Sanc Kingdom was attacked by the United Earth Sphere Alliance, crushing the Peacecraft monarchy. Vice Foreign Minister Darlian, a friend of the Peacecrafts, eventually adopted Relena, and she was renamed '''Relena Darlian'''.

===Gundam Wing: Episode Zero===
In the year AC 191, 11-year-old Relena attends The St. Gabriel Academy. There, she would meet an unnamed boy (who is assumed to be Heero Yuy). Later on, her home city would be under attack, and she was then held hostage by an unnamed assailant, until she was rescued by Zechs Merquise (which Relena, at that time, isn't aware that he is her older brother). Zechs, having abandoned the Peacecraft name, introduced himself as the "Prince of the Stars", and walked away. The next day, the unknown boy is gone before Relena could introduce herself to him. (This is where her quote, "''My name is Relena Darlian, what's yours?''", came from in the first episode of the TV series.) Rumors that spread around the school said that the orphaned boy was part of the attack on a base near the town.

===Gundam Wing===

During a shuttle flight with Vice Foreign Minister Darlian, Relena witnesses a battle between Wing Gundam and a Leo mobile suit. She then went to the Gundam's crash site, and was shocked to discover that the pilot is a boy who is the same age as her. Before she can know who he is, the boy fled the scene, stealing an ambulance. Back at her school, Relena discovers that the new student (who introduces himself as Heero Yuy) was the same pilot whom she met earlier, and later on, she would try to invite Heero to her birthday party, but Heero tears up the invitation, and threatens to kill her.

Vice-Foreign Minister Darlian was killed in an assassination attempt by Lady Une, and as he lays dying, he tells Relena that he is not her real father, and that her real father is King Peacecraft. She was then saved by Doctor J's (Heero's trainer) workers, and upon meeting him, she learns the truth about Heero Yuy.
