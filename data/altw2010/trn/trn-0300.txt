thumb|Księżna Diana w [[Bristolu w 1987]]
'''Lady Diana Frances Spencer''', późniejsza '''Diana, księżna Walii''' (ur. Karola, księcia Walii i matka jego dwóch synów, najmłodsza córka Edwarda Spencera, 8. hrabiego Spencer i Frances Burke-Roche, córki 4. barona Fermoy. Zasłynęła dzięki swej działalności dobroczynnej i charytatywnej.

== Dzieciństwo i młodość ==
=== Wczesne lata ===
Chrzest Diany odbył się w St. Mary Magdalene Church w Sandringham. Ceremonię odprawił biskup Norwich Królowej Matki). Diana pochodziła ze starego, arystokratycznego rodu, była spokrewniona z takimi osobistościami jak królowie Henryk VII, Jakub I oraz ormiańskie korzenie,

Diana wychowała się wraz z dwiema starszymi siostrami, Sarah i Jane, w Park House w Szwajcarii. ''Była mało pewna siebie'' – wspomina koleżanka z uczelni – ''Pamiętam, że kiedyś któraś z nas skomplementowała jej kaszmirowy kostium. Ona zarumieniła się i powiedziała: Mamusia mi go kupiła. Boże, w tym wieku, kiedy nienawidzi się wszystkiego, co podoba się mamusi!''

W 1975 r. zmarł dziadek Diany, Albert Spencer, 7. hrabia Spencer. Ojciec Diany został więc 8. hrabią Spencer, zaś Diana otrzymała tytuł '''lady Diany Spencer''' (dotychczas była tytułowana '''Czcigodną Dianą Spencer''', ''The Honourable Diana Spencer''). Diana wraz z rodziną przeprowadziła się z Park House do rodowej rezydencji Spencerów, Althorp w hrabstwie Northamptonshire.

=== Edukacja ===
Diana rozpoczęła naukę w Riddlesworth Hall w Norfolk, później uczęszczała do West Heath Girls' School w Sevenoaks w Kencie. Była przeciętną uczennicą, nie zdała nawet jednego ze swoich egzaminów. W Szwajcarii, w szkole w Rougemont. Została przedszkolanką. Diana była utalentowaną amatorską śpiewaczką, lubiła sport i przez długi czas chciała być baletnicą. Jej ulubionym zespołem muzycznym był Duran Duran.

== Małżeństwo ==
=== Zaręczyny ===
Diana poznała księcia Karola przez siostrę Sarah, na wycieczce konnej w lord Mountbatten, poradził Karolowi, aby za żonę pojął młodą kobietę, która byłaby w niego zapatrzona jak w obraz. Aby zyskać przychylność rodziny królewskiej, wybranka winna mieć królewskie lub arystokratyczne pochodzenie, być protestantką i dziewicą.

Imię Diany Spencer pojawiło się na liście kandydatek na żonę Karola, jednak to, że mogłaby zostać jego żoną, wydawało się nieprawdopodobne. Jako przyszłą żonę zasugerowała ją Karolowi jego długoletnia przyjaciółka (i druga żona) Elżbiecie II i chociaż Karol nie był do niej przekonany, uznała ją za idealną kandydatkę, W końcu książę Filip, ojciec Karola, zmusił go do zawarcia związku z Dianą i ten przymusowo się jej oświadczył.

=== Ślub ===
Zaręczyny ogłoszono dolarów. katedrze św. Pawła w króla Hiszpanii Jana Karola, gdyż Hiszpania toczyła z Wielką Brytanią spór o Gibraltar) oraz następcy tronu. Kolejny miliard osób oglądało ślub w telewizji.

Małżeństwo Diany nie układało się od początku. Wieczór przed ślubem Karol spędził u swej kochanki, Camilli. Rzucona w wir obowiązków królewskich, księżna bardzo starała się sprostać zadaniom, jakie przed nią stawiała rodzina królewska. Jeżeli udawało się jej dobrze wywiązać z powierzonych zadań, nie spotykała jej jednak żadna pochwała, w przeciwnym razie zaś dostawała ostrą reprymendę od męża.

=== Dzieci ===
Małżeństwo Dianie przyniosło dwóch synów. Pierwszą ciążę przechodziła bardzo źle (miała bulimię). 11 miesięcy po ślubie Wilhelma Artura Filipa Ludwika (''William Arthur Philip Louis''). 15 września 1984 r. przyszedł na świat drugi syn, któremu nadano imiona Henryka Karola Alberta Dawida (''Henry Charles Albert David''), zwany przez otoczenie Harrym. Księżna Walii zawsze i do końca kochała i uwielbiała obu synów nazywając ich "swoimi chłopcami". Po śmierci księżnej książę Karol pokazał jednak światu, że również jest wspaniałym ojcem następców brytyjskiego tronu. Stara się zawsze, tak jak tego pragnęła matka jego synów, wychowywać ich w tradycji rodziny Windsorów, ale jednocześnie wprowadzać nowoczesne metody wychowawcze, w tym publiczne okazywanie miłości.

Po urodzeniu księcia Williama, Diana popadła w depresję poporodową. Przed ślubem cierpiała na bulimię, a przed urodzeniem pierworodnego syna próbowała podobno popełnić samobójstwo. Miała rzucić się ze schodów, ale znalazła ją jej teściowa. Niektórzy twierdzili, że był to wyraz jej rozpaczy i wołania o pomoc, inni że próba samobójcza nigdy nie miała miejsca. Diana wspomniała o tym wypadku w wywiadzie udzielonym już po rozwodzie.

== Separacja i rozwód ==
Małżeństwo Karola i Diany zaczęło się rozpadać po narodzinach młodszego syna. Karol był niezadowolony z faktu urodzenia syna (chciał córkę), "w dodatku rudego", jak miał się wyrazić. Małżonkowie stopniowo oddalali się od siebie, w wywiadach prasowych przerzucali na siebie nawzajem odpowiedzialność za rozpad związku. Karol odnowił swoją przedmałżeńską znajomość z Camillą Parker Bowles, natomiast Diana wdała się w romans z jej instruktorem jeździeckim Jamesem Hewittem (księżna przyznała się do tego romansu podczas wywiadu wyemitowanego w Barry'ego Mannakee, sprzedawcę dzieł sztuki Olivera Hoare'a, żonatego gracza rugby Willa Carlinga, Hasnata Khana i wreszcie Dodiego Al-Fayeda.

Kiedy fakty z prywatnego życia pary książęcej ujrzały światło dzienne, królowa Elżbieta wezwała syna i synową na audiencję, na której zasugerowała im przeprowadzenie rozwodu. premier Izbie Gmin separację księstwa Walii. Rozwód nastąpił 28 sierpnia 1996 r. Dianie odebrano tytuł Jej Królewskiej Wysokości, ale pozostawiono tytuł księżnej Walii. Uznawano ją też dalej jako członkinię brytyjskiej rodziny królewskiej, jako matkę drugiej i trzeciej osoby w linii sukcesji do brytyjskiego tronu.

Ostatnią sesją fotograficzną Diany była autorstwa Mario Testino, który jak sama księżna stwierdziła "doskonale oddał jej osobowość".

== Działalność charytatywna ==

Księżna Walii stała się popularna dzięki swojej działalności charytatywnej. Już po ślubie odwiedzała szpitale i wspomagała chorych, co było tradycyjnym obowiązkiem księżnych Walii. W kwietniu HIV.

'''Diana, Princess of Wales''', (Diana Frances;<ref name="sur"/> ''née'' Spencer; William and Henry (Harry), are second and third in line to the thrones of the United Kingdom and fifteen other Commonwealth Realms. 

A public figure from the announcement of her engagement to Coroner's Inquest reported in April 2008 that Diana had been unlawfully killed by the driver and the following paparazzi.<ref name='inquest1'></ref> 
 
==Early life==
Diana was the youngest daughter of Edward John Spencer, Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp (formerly the Honourable Frances Burke Roche, and later Frances Shand Kydd). She was born at Park House, Sandringham in Blackburn); her godparents included John Floyd (the chairman of The Lady Sarah Spencer (born 19 March 1955),
The Lady Jane Spencer (born Charles Spencer (born 20 May 1964). Following her parents' acrimonious divorce in 1969 (over Lady Althorp's affair with wallpaper heir Peter Shand Kydd), Diana's mother took her and her younger brother to live in an apartment in London's Knightsbridge, where Diana attended a local day school. That Christmas the Spencer children went to celebrate with their father and he subsequently refused to allow them to return to London with their mother. Lady Althorp sued for custody of her children, but Lady Althorp's mother's testimony against her daughter during the trial contributed to the court's decision to award custody of Diana and her brother to their father.

In 1976 Lord Spencer married Raine, Countess of Dartmouth, the only daughter of romantic novelist Barbara Cartland, after he was named as the "other party" in the Dartmouths' divorce. During this time Diana travelled up and down the country, living between her parents' homes—with her father at the Spencer seat in Northamptonshire, and with her mother, who had moved to the Island of Seil off the west coast of Scotland. Diana, like her siblings, did not get along with her stepmother.

==Royal descent==

Diana was born into the Irish, Scottish, English,  American and remote Armenian ancestry. One of her great-grandmothers on her mother's side was the New York heiress Frances Work. On her father's side, she was a descendant of King Charles II of England through two sons:
* Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton, son by Barbara Villiers, 1st Duchess of Cleveland
* Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond and Lennox, son by Louise de Kérouaille

She was also a descendant of King Arabella Churchill, the sister of Robert the Bruce; Mary Boleyn; Lady Catherine Grey; Maria de Salinas; John Egerton, 2nd Earl of Bridgewater; and James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby. 

Diana was also a descendant of the Plantagenet line from Henry III King of England via Mary Boleyn. Diana is also descendant of the Tudor line from Henry VII King of England via Lady Catherine Grey. Her ancestry is thus as linked to Plantagenent, Tudor and Stuart royal lines as much as her royal inlaws (the Windsors).

The Spencers had been close to the Ruth, Lady Fermoy, was a long-time friend and a Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

==Education==
Diana was first educated at Silfield School O-levels twice.<ref name="fame1"></ref> In 1977, at the age of 16, she left West Heath and briefly attended Rougemont, Lady Sarah. Diana reportedly excelled in swimming and diving and longed to be a ballerina. She studied ballet for a time, but at 5'10" was too tall.

Diana moved to London before she turned seventeen. An apartment was purchased for her at Coleherne Court in the flatmates.

Prince Charles' love life had always been the subject of press speculation, and he was linked to numerous glamorous and aristocratic women, including Princess Diana's sister Lady Sarah Spencer. In his early thirties, he was under increasing pressure to marry. Legally, the only requirement was that he could not marry a Roman Catholic; a member of the Church of England was preferred. In order to gain the approval of his family and their advisers, any potential bride was expected to have a royal or aristocratic background, be a virgin, as well as be Protestant. 

===Engagement and wedding===
Their engagement became official £30,000 ring consisting of 14 diamonds and a sapphire.<ref name="WashPostEngagement"></ref>

The 20-year-old princess married at BST, and Diana wore a gown valued at £9000 with 25 foot train and the finest lace.<ref name="PDMarriage"></ref>

===Problems and separation===
In the late 1980s, the marriage of Diana and Charles fell apart, an event at first suppressed, then sensationalised, by the world media. Both the Prince and Princess of Wales allegedly spoke to the press through friends, each blaming the other for the marriage's demise. Charles resumed his old, pre-marital affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles. Asked what part Camilla had played in the break-up of her marriage,  Diana commented during the Panorama'', "Well there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded."<ref> Bradford, Sarah, ''Diana''(2006),p.294</ref> Diana had an affair with her riding instructor, Panorama'' television interview.<ref> Bradford, Sarah, ''Diana''(2006) p.293</ref> Charles had confirmed his own affair over a year earlier in a televised interview with Jonathan Dimbleby.<ref>*{{cite book

===Divorce===
In December 1995, the Queen asked Charles and Diana for "an early divorce".<ref name="time">[http://www.time.com/time/daily/special/diana/readingroom/9697/21296.html Diana Draws Blood Lashing out at Tiggy brings a legal warning and enrages the Queen] article in ''Time'' February 12 1996 (accessed 31 January 2008)</ref> This followed shortly after Diana's accusation that Tiggy Legge-Bourke had aborted Charles's child, causing Tiggy to instruct Peter Carter-Ruck to demand an apology.<ref name=time/> Two days before this story broke, Diana's secretary Patrick Jephson resigned, later claiming that Diana had "exulted in accusing Legge-Bourke of having had an abortion".<ref>Patrick Jephson, ''Shadows of a Princess'' (2000)</ref> On 20 December 1995, Buckingham Palace publicly announced that the Queen had sent letters to Charles and Diana advising them to divorce. The Queen's move was backed by the Prime Minister and by senior Privy Councillors, and, according to the BBC, was decided after two weeks of talks.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/20/newsid_2538000/2538985.stm BBC ON THIS DAY | 20 | 1995: 'Divorce': Queen to Charles and Diana<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Prince Charles immediately agreed with the suggestion. In February 1996, Diana announced her agreement as well.

The divorce was finalised on 28 August 1996.<ref name=timeline/>

Diana received a lump sum settlement of around £17,000,000 along with a legal order preventing her from discussing the details.<ref> </ref>

Days before the decree absolute of divorce, Letters Patent were issued by Queen Elizabeth II containing general rules to regulate the titles of people who married into the Royal Family after divorce. In accordance with those rules, as she was no longer married to the Prince of Wales, and so had ceased to be a Royal by marriage, Diana lost the style, ''Her Royal Highness'' and instead was styled, '''Diana, Princess of Wales'''. Buckingham Palace issued a press release on the day of the day the decree absolute of divorce was issued, announcing Diana's change of title.

Buckingham Palace stated that Diana was still officially a member of the Royal Family, since she was the mother of the second- and third-in-line to the throne. This was confirmed by the Deputy Coroner of the Queen’s Household, Baroness Butler-Sloss, who after a pre-hearing on 8 January 2007 ruled that: "I am satisfied that at her death, Diana, Princess of Wales continued to be considered as a member of the Royal Household."<ref name="inquest1"></ref> This appears to have been confirmed in the High Court judicial review matter of ''Al Fayed & Ors v Butler-Sloss''. In that case, three High Court judges accepted submissions that the "very name ‘Coroner to the Queen’s Household’ gave the appearance of partiality in the context of inquests into the deaths of two people, ''one of whom was a member of the Royal Family'' and the other was not."<ref name="inquest2"></ref>

==Personal life after divorce==
After the divorce, Diana retained her apartment in Kensington Palace, completely redecorated, and it remained her home until her death. 

She publicly dated the respected heart inquest in November/December 2007.

After her Prince Charles or at boarding school.

===Charity work===
Starting in the mid- to late 1980s, the Princess of Wales became very well known for her support of several charity projects. This stemmed naturally from her role as Princess of Wales—she was expected to engage in hospital visits where she comforted the sick and in so doing, assumed the patronage of various charitable organisations—and from an interest in certain illnesses and health-related matters. Diana was a supporter of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a campaign that went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997.<ref></ref>

===AIDS awareness===
In April 1987,  the Princess of Wales was one of the first high-profile celebrities to be photographed touching a person infected with HIV at the 'chain of hope' organization. Her contribution to changing the public opinion of AIDS sufferers was summarized in December 2001 by Bill Clinton at the 'Diana, Princess of Wales Lecture on AIDS':

===Landmines===
The pictures of former Princess touring an Angolan minefield, in a ballistic helmet and flak jacket, were seen worldwide. It was during this campaign that some accused the Princess of meddling in politics and declared her a 'loose cannon.'<ref name="mines1"></ref> In August 1997, just days before her death, she visited Bosnia with the Landmine Survivors Network. Her interest in landmines was focused on the injuries they create, often to children, long after a conflict is over.

She is believed to have influenced the signing, though only after her death, of the Second Reading of the Landmines Bill 1998 to the British House of Commons, the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, paid tribute to Diana's work on landmines:

</ref> |20px|20px|Robin Cook}}

The United Nations appealed to the nations which produced and stockpiled the largest numbers of landmines (China, Japan, India, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, and the United States) to sign the Ottawa Treaty forbidding their production and use, for which Diana had campaigned. Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), said that landmines remained "a deadly attraction for children, whose innate curiosity and need for play often lure them directly into harm's way".<ref></ref>''

==Death==
thumb|right|The entrance to the Pont d'Alma tunnel, the site of Diana's fatal car accident.

On Mercedes-Benz S280 (registration no. 688 LTV 75) crashed into the thirteenth pillar of the tunnel. The two-lane tunnel was built without metal barriers in front of the pillars, so a slight change in vehicle direction could easily result in a head-on collision with a tunnel pillar. None<!--Attention: Do not remove!--> of the four occupants wore seat belts.<ref>Operation Paget Report, chapter six, page 421: ''"Operation Paget's view is that none of the seat belts were being worn at the time of the impact, including that of Trevor Rees-Jones. From the nature of marks found on his seat belt, it is considered unlikely that he was even in the process of attempting to put it on at all at the time of the crash."''; see also: REES-JONES: ''"I think I've been told that I wasn't wearing a seat belt. I assume that's been misreported, that the airbag must have saved me on the initial impact, but then my face and chest hit the dashboard when the car was pushed around."'', in: Trevor Rees-Jones Tells 'The Bodyguard's Story'; [http://www.spiegel.de/img/0,1020,984100,00.jpg Diana photo at 31 August 1997 around 12:21 a.m, two minutes before the accident happened]</ref>

The paparazzi, who had been trailing the car, arrived at the Alma underpass at different stages. Serge Arnal, Christian Martinez and Stéphane Darmon appear to have arrived first, quickly followed by Serge Benhamou. Records supplied by mobile telephone operators Itinéris and SFR support Serge Arnal's claim that he attempted to call the emergency services. Film seized from the cameras of Christian Martinez and Serge Arnal showed that they were taking photographs of the car and/or the occupants almost immediately after arrival at the scene – there were no emergency services near the car visible in their photographs.

Blood analysis showed that Henri Paul was illegally intoxicated with alcohol whilst driving. He drove at high speed in order to evade the pursuing paparazzi. Tests showed he had consumed amounts of alcohol three times that of the French legal limit. Fayed's bodyguard, Trevor Rees-Jones, who was in the passenger seat, was closest to the point of impact and yet he was the only survivor of the crash. Henri Paul and Dodi Fayed were killed instantly, and Diana—unbelted in the back seat- slid forward during the impact and, having been violently thrown around the interior, "submarined" under the seat in front of her, suffering serious damage to her heart with subsequent internal bleeding.<ref name="Doctors: Diana's injuries impossible to survive">[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/31/diana.medical/index.html CNN - Doctors: Diana's injuries impossible to survive - August 31, 1997<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She was eventually, after considerable delay, transported by ambulance to the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, but on the way she went into cardiac arrest twice.<ref name="Doctors: Diana's injuries impossible to survive" /> Despite lengthy resuscitation attempts, including internal cardiac massage, she died at 4 a.m. local time.<ref></ref> Her funeral on 6 September 1997 was broadcast and watched by an estimated 2.5 billion people worldwide.<ref></ref>

An eighteen-month French judicial investigation concluded in 1999 that the car crash that killed Diana was caused by Paul, who lost control of the car at high speed while intoxicated and under the influence of antidepressants.<ref></ref> 

Since February 1998, Dodi's father, Hôtel Ritz, for which Paul worked) has claimed that the crash was a result of a conspiracy,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/55800.stm BBC News | UK | Diana crash was a conspiracy - Al Fayed<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and has since contended that the crash was orchestrated by MI6 on the instructions of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7251568.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Point-by-point: Al Fayed's claims<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Tribute, funeral and burial===

Diana's funeral took place in Westminster Abbey on 6 September, 1997. The previous day, Queen Elizabeth II paid tribute to her former daughter-in-law in a live television broadcast:  

</ref> |Queen Elizabeth II}}

The sudden and unexpected death of a very popular royal figure brought statements from senior figures worldwide and many tributes by members of the public. In reaction to the death people left public offerings of flowers, candles, cards and personal messages. 

Diana's funeral saw a widespread outpouring of grief at her passing.<ref></ref> It was attended by all members of the royal family. Her sons, William and Harry, walked behind her casket along with their father, Prince Charles, and grandfather, Prince Phillip together with Diana's brother, Earl Spencer. During the service, Elton John sang a new version of "Candle In The Wind", his hit song about Marilyn Monroe. He changed the title to "Goodbye England's Rose" and the lyrics to refer to Diana. The burial occurred privately, later the same day. The Prince of Wales, Diana's sons, her mother, siblings, a close friend, and a clergyman were present. Diana's remains had been dressed in a black long-sleeved dress designed by Catherine Walker; ironically she had chosen the dress a few weeks before. A set of rosary beads had been placed in her hands, a gift she received from Mother Teresa, who died the same week as Diana. Her grave is on an island within the grounds of Althorp Park, the Spencer family home.<ref name="home1"></ref>

The original plan was for Diana to be buried in the Spencer family vault at the local church in nearby Great Brington, but her younger brother, Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, said that he was concerned about public safety and security and the onslaught of visitors that might overwhelm Great Brington. He decided that he wanted his older sister to be buried where her grave could be easily cared for and visited in privacy by her sons and other relations.

The island is in an ornamental lake known as The Round Oval within Althorp Park's gardens. A path with thirty-six oak trees, marking each year of her life, leads to the Oval. Four black swans swim in the lake, guarding the island. In the water there are water lilies, which, in addition to white roses, were Diana's favourite flowers.

On the southern verge of the Round Oval sits the Summerhouse, previously in the gardens of Admiralty House, London, and now adapted to serve as a memorial to Diana.<ref name="althorp1"></ref> An ancient arboretum stands nearby, which contains trees planted by Prince William and Prince Harry, other members of her family, and Diana herself.

====Memorials====

Immediately after her death, many sites around the world became briefly ad hoc memorials to Diana, where the public left flowers and other tributes. The largest was outside the gates of Kensington Palace. Permanent memorials include:
* The Hyde Park, London opened by Queen Elizabeth II.
* The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Playground in Kensington Gardens, London.
* The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Walk, a circular path between Kensington Gardens, Green Park, Hyde Park and St James's Park, London
In addition, there are two memorials inside Harrods department store, owned by Dodi Al-Fayed's father Mohamed Al-Fayed, in London.  The first memorial consists of photos of the two behind a pyramid-shaped display that holds a wine glass still smudged with lipstick from Diana's last dinner as well as an 'engagement' ring Dodi purchased the day before they died.<ref name=RS></ref>  The second, unveiled in 2005 and titled "Innocent Victims", is a bronze statue of the two dancing on a beach beneath the wings of an albatross.<ref name=CNN090105></ref>
