'''Faruq''' (11. helmikuuta 1920–18. maaliskuuta 1965) oli  Egyptin ja Sudanin kuningas ja Nubian, Darfurin ja Kordofanin suuriruhtinas ja Egyptin viimeinen kuningas.
Hän seurasi isäänsä Fu’adia 1936. Hänen sisarensa Fauziyya oli lyhyen aikaa Iranin kuningatar.

Faruq sai koulutuksensa Englannissa Royal Military Academyssa, Woolwichissa. Noustessaan valtaistuimelle 16-vuotias kuningas piti julkisen arabiaa vaan puhui osmania hovissaan.

Teinikuningas nautti kuninkaallisesta elämäntyylistä. Hän matkusti usein Eurooppaan ostosmatkoille.
Noustessaan valtaan hän erotti pääministeri Mustafa al-Nahhas paššan, jonka brittihallitus pakotti ottamaan takaisin. Hän ei muodostanut suhdetta heräävään Wafd-puolueen johtamaan nationalistiseen liikkeeseen. Myöhemmin hän osoitti poliittista kyvyttömyyttä Israelin suhteen Egyptin brittimiehityksen jatkuessa.

Toisen maailmansodan aikana kuninkaan elämäntyyli herätti tyytymättömyyttä kansassa. Hän piti valot kleptomaanisen kuninkaan uhriksi. Hän sai lempinimen "Kairon varas." Kuninkaan yksityiselämään kuuluivat yökerhot ja filmitähdet. Tämä ärsytti molempia puritaaneja ja patriootteja.

Vuodet 1950 ja 1951 Egypti vaati brittejä vetäytymään Sudanista. Egypti sanoi irti liittosopimuksen lokakuussa 1951 ja Faruq julistettiin Egyptin ja Sudanin kuninkaaksi. Korruptiosyytökset ja häviö vuoden 1948 Israelin sodassa johtivat 23. heinäkuuta 1952 sotilasvallankaappaukseen, jossa Muhammad Nagib ja Gamal Abdel Nasser pakottivat Faruqin luopumaan kruunusta ja maanpakoon Italiaan ja Monacoon, jossa entinen kuningas vietti loppuelämänsä. Välittömästi kruunusta luopumisen jälkeen poikavauva Fu’ad II julistettiin kuninkaaksi, mutta monarkia oli väistämättä ohi. Vuonna 1953 maa muuttui virallisesti tasavallaksi.

'''Farouk I of Egypt''' (Arabic: فاروق الأول ''Fārūq al-Awwal'') ‎ (King of Fuad I, in 1936.  His sister Fawzia was Queen of Egyptian Revolution of 1952, and was forced to abdicate in favor of his infant son Ahmed Fuad, who succeeded him as King Fuad II. He died in exile in Italy. 

== Reign ==

The great-great-grandson of Muhammad Ali Pasha, Farouk was of Albanian descent. Before his father's death, he was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, England. Upon his coronation, the 16-year-old King Farouk made a public radio address to the nation, the first time a sovereign of Egypt had ever spoken directly to his people in such a way:

Farouk was enamored of the glamorous royal lifestyle. Although he already had thousands of acres of land, dozens of palaces, and hundreds of cars, the youthful king would often travel to Europe for grand shopping sprees, earning the ire of many of his subjects.

During the hardships of blacked-out because of German and Italian Sir Miles Lampson (who had an Italian wife), "I'll get rid of my Italians, when you get rid of yours". Farouk only declared war on the Axis Powers under heavy British pressure in 1945, long after the fighting in Egypt's Western Desert had ceased.

As he got older, the king began pilfering objects and artifacts while on state visits abroad, including a ceremonial sword from the Shah of Iran and a pocket watch from Winston Churchill. Common people were also often the victims of the kleptomaniacal monarch, and by mingling with commoners Farouk soon became a highly-skilled pickpocket. He got a nickname from his own citizens "The Thief of Cairo" to signify his well-known aptitude for thievery, as well as his lavish lifestyle and corrupt regime.

Widely condemned for his corrupt and ineffectual governance, the continued British occupation, and the Egyptian army's failure to prevent the loss of 78% of King Fuad II, but for all intents and purposes Egypt was now governed by the Naguib, Nasser and Free Officers. On June 18 1953, the revolutionary government formally abolished the monarchy, ending 150 years of the Muhammad Ali dynasty's rule, and Egypt was declared a republic.

The revolutionary government quickly moved to auction off the king's vast collection of trinkets and treasures.  Among the more famous of his possessions was one of the rare 1933 Double Eagle coins, though the coin disappeared before it could be returned to the United States.

The blue-eyed Farouk was thin early in his reign, but later gained enormous weight. His taste for fine cuisine made him dangerously obese, weighing nearly 300 pounds (136 kg) &ndash; an acquaintance described him as "a stomach with a head". He died in Rome, Italy on March 3, 1965. He collapsed and died at the dinner table following a characteristically heavy meal. His body was returned to Egypt and buried in the Mosque of Al Rifai' in Cairo.

== Affairs and marriages ==

In addition to an affair with the British writer and siren Safinaz Zulficar (1921&ndash;1988), a Farida upon her marriage; they married in 1938, divorced in 1948, and had three daughters.

His second wife was a commoner, Fuad II.

Whilst in exile in Italy he met Irma Capece Minutolo, an opera singer, who became his companion. In 2005, she claimed that she married the king in 1957.[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/734/sc3.htm]

== Portrayals ==
