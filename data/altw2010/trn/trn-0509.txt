'''''Alundra 2: A New Legend Begins''''' is an action/puzzle  Contrail and published by 1999 and in North America and Europe in the next year. Unlike its predecessor, ''Alundra'', ''Alundra 2'' features a new 3D look which opens up a new world of puzzles. Because of its 3D look, rather simple plot, and the fact it has nothing to do with its predecessor apart from the name, ''Alundra 2'' was not well received. No further ''Alundra'' titles were made, most likely because of ''Alundra 2'''s poor reception.

''Alundra 2'''s story is set in the kingdom of Varuna. A powerful sorcerer Mephisto is using magical wind-up keys to control humans and turn animals  into powerful killing machines. You play Flint, a young hero and Pirate Hunter who is wanted for treason, and is after the pirates that caused his parents' death.

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay to ''Alundra 2'' is very similar to the Legend of Zelda series, and indeed, the original Alundra, though there were some major changes. There is much emphasis on puzzle solving and dungeon exploring.

== Major characters ==
* '''Flint'''
His family was killed by a group of pirates, and he's been hunting them ever since. He's also a wanted man in the Kingdom of Varuna. In a strange turn of events later in the game, he will be forced to work together with the pirate family to save the Kingdom from Mephisto. He later kills Mephisto. During the last cutscene it shows Flint and Alexia kissing.

* '''Alexia'''
Princess of Varuna. She's searching for her father, the King of Varuna. Follows Flint around most of the time and, like most Princesses, gets kidnapped pretty often. Carries a sword even though she doesn't seem to have a clue on how to use it. In the last cutscene it shows Alexia and Flint kissing.

* '''Lord Prunewell'''
The old servant of Alexia, appears near the start of the game to coach you in the ways of the game.

* '''Zeppo'''
The leader of the pirate family. He, like the rest of the pirate family, is there for comic relief. He's unstable, violent, but pretty dumb.

* '''Ruby'''
Daughter of Zeppo. Extremely bossy and hot-tempered (just like dad). She's basically there to annoy the hell out of everyone else. Later in the game she develops a crush on Flint.

* '''Albert'''
Son of Zeppo. Quiet and calm. The brains of the pirate family, but then that's not really saying much. Later in the game he becomes friend to Flint.

* '''Mephisto'''
The master of the magic screw. His screws, when attached to a living organism,turns them into killing machines. His name is a reference to the devil, making it no coincidence that he's the main villain of the game. He later kidnaps Alexia, but in the end is killed by Flint.

* '''Baron Diaz'''
He's taken over the throne after the disappearance of the King of Varuna; is secretly collaborating with Mephisto. Desperately wants to marry Princess Alexia.

=== 収集 ===
; パズルのかけら
: 世界各地の宝箱から入手する。集めてジーケンに渡すと、連続斬りを伝授してもらえる。
: かなりわかりにくい所に隠されていたり、難しいアクションや創意工夫を要求されたりする場合が多く、
: 全て集めるのは非常に難しい。ただ「１度チャンスを逃すともう取れない」というものは無いので
: 根気よく探せば全てのピースを集めることが出来るだろう。
: その点、かなりの強運を要求されるものもあった前作の「金のくちばし」よりは良心的だと言える。
