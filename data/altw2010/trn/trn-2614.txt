'''Битва в Тевтобургском лесу''' - сражение между армией германцев под предводительством Арминия и римской армией Публия Квинтилия Вара, случившееся с 9 по 11 сентября 9 н. э.

== Предыстория ==
С конца римляне активно готовились к войне с германцами.На Испании.Их разместили во вновь построенных лагерях в Липпы).В ходе успешных военных действий 12-империи, вплоть до Эльбы.Была образована новая провинция Германия.Удачный поход Друза за свевских племён, маркоманов, между 9 и бойев, в Герцинском лесу (территории современной Богемии).

Переселение маркоманов возглавил Августа.Вернувшись на родину, он добился власти и создал союз племён, куда вошли кроме свевских племён Риму, поэтому было решено направить против Маробода войска под командованием Тиберия.

В Сентием Сатурнином и южную во главе с Тиберием, должна была объединиться уже на территории маркоманов.Когда до соединения оставалось уже пять дней пути, Тиберий узнал о начавшемся в Паннонии и Далмации восстании и вынужден был вернуться.С Марободом был заключён мир на выгодных для него условиях.

Главнокомандующим рейнской армией в отсутствие Тиберия был назначен Сирией.Он попытался ввести в Германии провинициальную систему управления, упорядочить налогообложение и учредить судопроизводство по римскому образцу.Однако его действия послужили причиной недовольства германских племён, в первую очередь херусков во главе с Арминием.Он с помощью уговоров и убеждений поднял против римлян другие германские племена:бруктеров, марсов и хаттов.Арминий рассудил, что нет ничего легче, чем обмануть противника, который хочет быть обманутым.В сентябре 9 года Вар узнал о волнении среди отдалённых германских племён.Известие это было ложным.Арминий специально подстроил так, чтобы заманить Вара как можно дальше на территории Германии и пройти через земли якобы дружественных римлянам племён, заставить его отклониться от военной дороги, а затем, окружив его, легко с ним раправиться.Вар поддался на уловку, хотя Сегест его неоднократно предупреждал о готовившемся заговоре германцев.Три легиона,XVII, XVIII И XIX, 6 вспомогательных когорт и 3 конные алы - всего 25 000-30 000 человек, обоз с маркитанами, женщинами и детьми отправился в отдалённые территории Германии.Как только они углублились в лес, Арминий их покинул под предлогом сбора вспомогательных войск.На самом деле он поднял соседние племена и двинулся против Вара.

Первое сражение состоялось в глухом лесу, когда шёл сильный дождь, а почва под ногами была очень скользской, что затрудняло передвижение и уменьшало манёвренность римской армии.Римляне, захваченные врасплох, не смогли быстро перестроиться в боевой порядок и потеряли много солдат. Выбрав более или менее удобное место, они построили военнй лагерь, сожгли большую часть повозок и остальных вещей, которые затрудняли продвижение.На четвёртый день похода в Тевтобургском лесу произошло новое столкновение.
<blockquote>''Дождь и сильный ветер не позволяли римлянам ни двигаться вперёд, ни твёрдо стоять на ногах.но и лишил их возможности пользоваться оружием.Они не могли как следует пустить намокшие стрелы, дротики и щиты.Напротив, для врагов, которые по большей части были легко вооружены и безопасно могли наступать и отступать, это было не так плохо!''<ref>Из произведений современника</ref></blockquote>
Римляне потерпели сокрушительное поражение, потеряв около 20 000 человек.Германцы захватили военные значки и орлов легионов.Публий Квинтилий Вар, боясь попасть в плен, покончил жизнь самоубийством.

== Итоги ==
Разгром в Тевтобургском лесу привёл к важным политическим последствиям.Тиберий, посланный в 10 году разгромить германцев, не сумел добиться желаемых результатов.Тогда император Август был вынужден удовлетвориться границей по левому берегу Рейна и до конца своего правления не вёл здесь никаких войн.

== Памятник германцам ==
В императорской Германии 1871 - 1918 гг. битва в Тевтобургском лесу была предметом государственного культа. В учебниках истории кайзеровского периода она подавалась как переломная победа германцев над Римской империей. Император Вильгельм II проводил ежегодные парады в этом месте.

The '''Battle of the Roman legions led by Publius Quinctilius Varus. 

The battle began a seven-year war which established the decline of the Roman influence in the West. The Roman Empire made no further concerted attempts to conquer Germania beyond the Rhine.

The battle (which is called '''Schlacht im Teutoburger Wald''', '''Varusschlacht''' or '''Hermannsschlacht''' in German) had a profound effect on 19th century German nationalism along with the recovery of the histories of Tacitus in the 15th century, in which the Germans identified with the Germanic tribes as a way to give the (at the time politically disunited) "German people" a common origin.

In Pan Germanism''. The monument lay unfinished for decades until after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, which unified the country. The completed monument was then a symbol of conservative German nationalism. The battle and the Hermannsdenkmal monument is also commemorated by the similar Hermann Heights Monument in New Ulm, MN, U.S.A.

==Background== 
The Roman force was led by Publius Quinctilius Varus, a noble from an old family, an administrative official who was assigned to establish the new province of Germany in 7 AD.

Varus' opponent, Arminius, had lived in Rome as a Equestrian. After his return, he was a trusted advisor to Varus.<ref name="Bordewich" /> In secret, he forged an alliance of Marsi, Chatti, Bructeri, Chauci and Sicambri), but which he was able to unite due to outrage over Varus' measures. Historians believe that these were no different from the measures used to establish any nascent province — which often resulted in revolts .

While Varus was on his way from his summer camp somewhere west of the Weser river (its location remains disputed;<ref name="Bordewich"></ref> sites near the modern cities Minden or Rinteln have been suggested by the historian Delbrück and the military writer Pastenaci, respectively) to the winter headquarters near the Rhine, he heard reports of a local rebellion, fabricated by Arminius. Varus decided to quell this uprising immediately and take a detour through territory unfamiliar to the Romans. Arminius, who accompanied Varus, probably directed him along a route that would facilitate an ambush. Another Cheruscan nobleman, Segestes, father of Arminius' wife, and opposed to the marriage, warned Varus the night before the departure of the Roman forces, allegedly even suggesting that Varus apprehend him along with several Germanic leaders whom he identified as covert participants in the planned uprising. But his warning was dismissed as the result of a personal feud. Arminius then left under the pretext of drumming up Germanic forces to support the Roman campaign, but instead led his troops, who must have been waiting in the vicinity, in attacks on surrounding Roman garrisons. Recent archaeological finds place the battle in Osnabrück County, Lower Saxony. On the basis of Roman accounts, the Romans must at this time have been marching northwestward from the area that is now the city of Detmold, passing east of Osnabrück; they must then have camped in this area prior to being attacked.

== The Battle ==
Varus's forces included three legions (cohorts of auxiliary troops (non-Roman allies) and three squadrons of cavalry (''alae''), most of which lacked combat experience with Germanic fighters under local conditions. The Roman forces were not marching in combat formation, and were interspersed with large numbers of camp-followers. As they entered the forest (probably just northeast of Osnabrück ), they found the track narrow and muddy; according to Dio Cassius a violent storm had also arisen. He also writes that Varus neglected to send out advance reconnaissance parties.

The line of march was now stretched out perilously long — estimates are that it surpassed 15 km (9 miles), and was perhaps as long as 20 km (12 miles).<ref name="Bordewich" /> It was then suddenly attacked by Germanic warriors. Arminius knew Roman tactics very well and could direct his troops to counter them effectively, using locally superior numbers against the spread-out Roman legions. The Romans managed to set up a fortified night camp, and the next morning broke out into the open country north of the Wiehen mountains, near the modern town of Osterkappeln. The break-out cost them heavy losses, as did a further attempt to escape by marching through another forested area, with the torrential rains continuing, preventing them from using their bows, and rendering them virtually defenseless, as their shields too became waterlogged.

They then undertook a night march to escape, but marched straight into another trap that Arminius had set, at the foot of Kalkriese Hill (near Osnabrück). There, the sandy, open strip on which the Romans could march easily was constricted by the hill, so that there was a gap of only about 100 m between the woods and the swampland at the edge of the Great Bog. Moreover, the road was blocked by a trench, and, towards the forest, an earthen wall had been built along the roadside, permitting the Germanic tribesmen to attack the Romans from cover. The Romans made a desperate attempt to storm the wall, but failed, and the highest-ranking officer next to Varus, Numonius Vala, abandoned the troops by riding off with the cavalry; however, he too was overtaken by the Germanic cavalry and killed, according to Velleius Paterculus. The Germanic warriors then stormed the field and slaughtered the disintegrating Roman forces; Varus committed suicide.<ref name="Bordewich" /> Velleius reports that one commander, Ceionus, "shamefully" surrendered, while his colleague Eggius "heroically" died leading his doomed troops.

Around 15,000–20,000 Roman soldiers must have died; not only Varus, but also many of his officers are said to have taken their own lives by falling on their swords in the approved manner.<ref name="Bordewich" /> sacrificed by the Germanic forces as part of their indigenous religious ceremonies. However, others were ransomed, and the common soldiers appear to have been enslaved.

All Roman accounts stress the completeness of the Roman defeat, the extremely heavy Roman casualties, and the minimal Germanic losses. That account is confirmed by the finds at Kalkriese, where, along with 6000 pieces (largely scraps) of Roman equipment, there is only one single item — part of a spur — that is clearly Germanic. Even allowing for the fact that several thousand Germanic soldiers were deserting militiamen who wore Roman armor (which would thus show up as "Roman" in the archaeological digs), and for the fact that the Germanic tribes wore less metal and more perishable organic material, this indicates surprisingly slight Germanic losses. The Germanic practice of burying dead Germanic warriors' battle gear with them may have contributed to the lack of Germanic relics, given the victors' ability to gather such at their leisure.

The victory over the legions was followed by a clean sweep of all Roman forts, garrisons and cities — of which there were at least two — east of the Rhine; the remaining two Roman legions, commanded by Varus' nephew Lucius Nonius Asprenas, were content to try to hold that river. One fort (or possibly city), Aliso, fended off the Germanic tribes for many weeks, perhaps a few months, before the garrison, which included survivors of the Teutoburg Forest, successfully broke out under their commander, Lucius Caeditius and reached the Rhine.

==Aftermath==
Upon hearing of the defeat, the emperor Augustus, according to the Roman historian English as "give me back my eagles," as in the BBC series based on the I, Claudius'').

The three legion numbers were never used again by the Romans after this defeat, unlike other legions that were restructured — a case unique in Roman history.

The battle abruptly ended the period of triumphant and exuberant Roman expansion that had followed the end of the Civil Wars 40 years earlier. Augustus' stepson Tiberius took effective control, and prepared for the continuation of the war. 

The Germanic tribes, on the other hand, profited greatly from the plunder of their victory, and gradually began to move to a higher stage of development, although they were still a long way from political unification. This was apparently the goal of Arminius, however, who immediately sent Varus' severed head to Germanic ruler, with the offer of an anti-Roman alliance. Marbod declined the offer, sent the head on to Rome for burial, and remained neutral throughout the ensuing war. Only thereafter did a brief, inconclusive war break out between the two Germanic leaders. 

During the next centuries, the Germanic tribes were able to profit from trade with Rome, without suffering the Roman yoke, and to absorb those elements of Roman culture which they wanted.

==Roman Retaliation==
Though the shock at the slaughter was enormous, the Romans immediately began a slow, systematic process of preparing for the reconquest of the country. In 14 AD, just after Augustus' death and the accession of his heir and stepson Tiberius, a massive raid was conducted by the new emperor's nephew Germanicus, followed the next year by two major campaigns with a large army estimated at 70,000 men, backed by naval forces.  He was able to devastate large areas and eliminate any form of active resistance, but the majority of the Germanic tribespeople fled at the sight of the Roman army into remote forests. The raids were considered a success since the major goal of destroying any rebel alliance networks was completed. After initial successes, including the capture of Arminius' wife Thusnelda, the army visited the site of the first battle. According to Tacitus, they found heaps of bleached bones and severed skulls nailed to trees, which they buried, "looking on all as kinsfolk and of their own blood". Burial pits with remains fitting this description have been found at Kalkriese Hill.

In spite of doubts on the part of his uncle, Emperor Tiberius, Germanicus managed to raise another huge army and invaded Germania again the next year, in 16 AD. He forced a crossing of the Weser near modern triumph and reassigned to a different command.<ref>An image of a coin of Germanicus with a recovered standard can be seen at http://www.livius.org/le-lh/legio/xvii.html</ref> <ref>Tacitus: [http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/annals.2.ii.html] Annals: Book 2 {Chapter 32}</ref>

The third standard was recovered in aquilae were placed within the ''Temple of the Avenging Mars'', (Tempio di Mars Ultor), the ruins of which stand today in the Forum of Augustus by the Via dei Fori Imperiali in Rome.

The last chapter of this story is recounted by the historian Annales'' (xii.27). Around 50 AD, bands of Chatti invaded Roman territory in Germania Superior, possibly an area in Hesse east of the Rhine which the Romans appear to have still held, and began to plunder. The Roman commander, Lucius Pomponius, raised a force from the Vangiones and Nemetes supported by Roman cavalry. They attacked the Chatti from both sides and defeated them, and joyfully found and liberated some of the men from Varus' legions, who had been held in slavery for 40 years.

Despite the successes enjoyed by his troops, Germanicus' campaign in Germania was in reaction to the mutinous intentions of his troops, and lacked any strategic value. In addition he engaged the very Germanic leader (Arminius) who had destroyed three Roman legions in AD 9, and exposed his troops to the remains of those dead Romans. Furthermore, in leading his troops across the Rhine, without recourse to Tiberius, he flouted the instructions of Augustus to keep that river as the boundary of the empire, and opened himself to doubts about his motives in such independent action. These errors in strategic and political judgement gave Tiberius reason enough to recall his nephew.<ref name="Bordewich" />
