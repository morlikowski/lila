Lo '''stemma della tedesco ''Bundeswappen'') è formato da un'aquila su scudo giallo e ha una tradizione storica lontanissima: sin dalle romana che portò un altro tipo di aquila, fino alla creazione del Sacro Romano Impero che continuava a identificarsi sotto l'aquila.

L'apparizione dell'attuale aquila imperiale (''adler'') è contemporanea approssimativamente a Carlo Magno, ed è ormai accertato che nel XIII secolo lo scudo dorato con l'uccello rappresentasse già l'Impero, mentre è del 1433 l'adozione, da parte di Sigismondo, di un'aquila a due teste.
Da allora il simbolo dell'impero sarebbe rimasto l'aquila bicefala, con impressa sul ventre l'insegna della casata imperiale.

Con la caduta dell'Impero nel 1806 e la creazione della Confederazione tedesca composta di 39 stati teutonici, fino al 1848 non esistette alcun simbolo tedesco. Fu nella rivoluzione tedesca dello stesso anno che il Parlamento di Francoforte riprese l'aquila con due teste, ma senza ovviamente le insegne imperiali, anche se il simbolo non raggiunse una popolarità diffusa.

Fu durante la regime nazista lo stemma tedesco, prima della svastica, era l'aquila, prima dell'adozione dell'attuale stemma nazionale.

The '''coat of arms of Germany''' is a symbol of eagle. The colors of the coat of arms are similar to those of the flag of Germany (black, red and gold). It is one of the oldest extant state symbols of Europe and is one of the oldest insignias in the world. 

= History =

== Medieval Age and Holy Roman Empire ==

The eagle's history as an emblem began very early. The Romans and their successors Byzantines (Greeks) reserved eagle imagery for only the most revered beings; namely, the supreme god and the emperor; and it served as a metaphor of invincibility.  Later, through its rei rock eagle (''adler''), referred to in German as the Reichsadler, on German soil probably date back to the time of Charlemagne (742-814). Around the year 1200 the black eagle icon on a gold field was generally recognised as the imperial coat of arms. <br>

In 1433 the double-headed eagle was adopted for the first time by the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund. Since then the double-headed eagle came to be used as the symbol of the Roman-German emperor, and hence as the coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. From the middle of the 15th century onwards, the respective emperors put the emblem of their dynasty on the eagle's chest. 
After the end of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation in 1806, a German state and a unified state emblem ceased to exist.

== German Confederation ==

In 1815, a German Confederation (''Bund'') of 39 loosely-united German states was founded on the territory of the former German empire. Until 1848, the confederation did not have a coat of arms of its own. The Federal Diet (''Bundestag'') meeting at Frankfurt am Main used a seal which carried the emblem of the Austrian Empire, since Austria had taken over the union's leadership. It showed a black, double-headed eagle, which Austria had adopted just before the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.<BR>
During the 1848 revolution, a new ''Reich'' coat of arms was adopted by the German National Assembly that convened in St. Paul's Church in Frankfurt. The black double-headed eagle was retained, but without the four symbols of the emperor: the sword, the imperial orb, the sceptre and the crown. The eagle rested on a golden shield; above was a five-pointed golden star. On both sides the shield was flanked by two flags with the colours black-red-gold. The emblem, however, never gained general acceptance.

== North German Confederation ==

In 1867, the North German Confederation was established without Austria and the southern German states, and under the leadership of the Kingdom of Prussia (see coat of arms of Prussia). A new coat of arms was adopted, which consisted of a shield with the colours black-white-red, flanked by two wild men holding cudgels and standing on a pedestal.

== German Empire ==

The German Empire re-introduced the Medieval single headed eagle in a golden shield.
The so called ''Reichsadler'', was already introduced at the Proclamation of Versailles, althogh the first version had been only a provisional one. The design of the eagle had been altered at least two times during the German Empire (1871-1918).

== Weimar Republic ==

The Weimar Republic (1918-1933), retained the Reichsadler without the symbols of the former Monarchy (Crown, Collar, Breast shield with the Prussian Arms).
