==History== 
The song, written by Higgenson, is based on 24-year-old steeplechase runner Delilah DiCrescenzo<ref>http://tv.popcrunch.com/real-life-%E2%80%9Cdelilah%E2%80%9D-dicrescenzo-on-today-show-video/"retrieved on 3 April 2008</ref>, who is now an assistant track coach at Bryn Mawr College.<ref>http://www.brynmawr.edu/athletics/intercollegiate/track/coach.htm/"retrieved on 9 June2008</ref> She started her running in high school. The high school she attended was Queen of Peace High School in Burbank, Illinois. Higgenson asked her out, but she turned him down. "I thought she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen," Higgenson says. "I told her, 'I have a song about you already.' Obviously, there was no song. But I thought it was smooth." A year later he wrote 'Hey There Delilah'. On the other hand, rumor has it that Delilah is a name chosen because it suited the song metrically.<ref>http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-06-25-plain-white-ts_N.htm" retrieved on  6 March 2008</ref>
