'''REN TV''' (Cyrillic: РЕН ТВ) is one of the largest private federal channels in Russia. Founded by Irena Lesnevskaya and her son, Dmitriy Lesnevskiy, who had been running REN as a production house for other national Russian television channels, it has broadcast since 1 January 1997. Its target audience is a young to middle-age city worker. Even though it focuses mostly on the audience in the 18 to 45 demographic, REN TV offers programming for a wide range of demographics, since the target viewer has a family and respects family values. The channel has won 13 TEFIs &ndash; awards presented by the Academy of Russian Television.

REN TV's network is a patchwork of 406 independent broadcasting companies in Russia and the CIS. REN's programmes are received in 718 towns and cities on the territory of Russia from Moscow city and Baltic states; 181 cities can receive REN TV's signal.

Russian media had reported that oil and gas group Surgutneftegaz had sold its stake in the channel to ABRos, which had increased its stake in the media company from 45% to 70%. '[T]here are indications that Bertelsmann was interested in selling up, after about 18 months in the Russian TV market,' the broadcasting news website added.<ref>[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=735 Abros ups stake in Ren TV], broadbandtvnews.com, Cambridge, UK, 20 April 2007.

==News coverage==
In November 2005 REN TV fired Olga Romanova, the anchor of its daily ''24'' news flagship.<ref> [http://www3.ndr.de/ndrtv_pages_std/0,3147,OID2084810_REF2488,00.html Russischer Sender feuert kritische Journalistin] ("Russian channel fired critical journalist"), NDR Fernsehen, 7 December 2005.</ref> Despite much publicity around the incident, her independent manner of reporting was continued by NTV Station. As of March 2008, Maksimovskaya was still in charge of news broadcasts on REN TV. Due to her activities, REN TV remains arguably Russia's only major TV outlet with liberal views, discussing the problem of state censorship and showing interviews with leaders of Other Russia. 

Prior to her departure from the channel, Romanova had told the US-funded Ekho Moskvy radio on 23 November 2005 &ndash; and the next day Ordzhonikidze barred from entering the channel's building.<ref>Julie A.

Ordzhonikidze had said on Ekho Moskvy that REN TV's news output had low ratings &ndash; and management had decided to try other anchors on the evening newscasts, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported. "Besides, it's hard for one person to anchor all the nightly newscasts every day of the week. [They] might just feel ill," he had added.<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20051125/42221623.html REN TV anchor Olga Romanova to sue management], RIA Novosti, Moscow, 25 November 2005.
