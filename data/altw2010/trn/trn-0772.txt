'''BLAGGERS I.T.A''' (formerly '''The Blaggers''') were an punk and militant anti-fascist and left wing lyrics and activism. 

The band forged particularly close links with anti-racist hip hop and electronic dance music, adding the letters ''I.T.A.'' to their name, which stood for "In The Area".

The band's vocal support for Anti Fascist Action and fascist groups such as neo-Nazi bands found it virtually impossible to play in Britain. In 1992, the white power band Skrewdriver attempted to play a major concert, and the band's fans were attacked and routed at Waterloo Station. This incident is mentioned on the ''United Colours of Blaggers ITA'' album in the anti-fascist song "Its Up To You". 

The band had a couple of top 60 singles in 1993 followed by a top 50 single in 1994 and they signed to DIY/independent music scene. The record deal alienated some of their fans because of Thorn EMI's former links with the arms trade and because EMI was seen as a large corporation dominating the music scene. Blaggers ITA justified the move by arguing that it is pointless having a message if you're only spreading it to a small number of people. They also demonstrated that signing the deal gave them more money to spend on political causes that they supported. 

Many of their biggest supporting tours and festival slots were cancelled and the music press effectively boycotted them after Matty Blagg was alleged to have punched Melody Maker writer Dave Simpson in mid 1993. The incident led to a court case in which none of the band members were convicted. Shortly after being dropped by EMI, Matty Blagg left the band, and Blaggers ITA continued for a short while. Blagg died in February 2000. A new version of the band have since reformed and played some concerts, although they have not released any records.
