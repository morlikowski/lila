== 近代陸軍における軍曹 ==
=== 概要 ===
軍隊の階級はその軍・時代によって色々な名称が存在するが、卒伍のうち優秀なものを曹という名称で登用し兵のまとめ役とする階級が存在し、序列として尉官の下になる点は概ね同じである。

戦前の日本では（アメリカ軍では現在も）立場上、兵の教練役や分隊長を務めたり叱咤激励し、部隊の士気と秩序維持を担っていた為「'''鬼軍曹'''」と畏敬・揶揄されることもあった。分隊長の場合、率いる凡その兵員の数は10名から20名といわれる。

軍曹以上を下士官として扱うか、或いはその下の階級以上を下士官として扱うかについては各国の法制上に差があるが、下士官の分類として重要な位置づけとなっている。<ref>「捕虜の待遇に関する1949年8月12日のジュネーヴ条約（第三条約）」第60条第1項では、「軍曹より下の階級」を第1分類とし（兵卒を想定している）、「軍曹その他の下士官又はこれに相当する階級」を第2分類（下士官を想定している）とするなど、「軍曹」（同条約の英語の原文では ）という階級は下士官の分類として重要な位置づけとなっている。</ref>また、「戦地にある軍隊の傷者及び病者の状態の改善に関する1949年8月12日のジュネーヴ条約（第一条約）」では第28条の規定により、衛生要員の相互に相当する階級に関して合意しなければならないとされる。

=== 日本陸軍 ===
==== 明治32年11月30日まで ====
明治32年12月1日以降の日本陸軍では軍曹を「1等軍曹」・「2等軍曹」として、下士官の最下級の分類としていた。明治32年12月1日に陸軍武官官等表が改正され、それぞれ旧「1等軍曹」は「軍曹」、旧「2等軍曹」は「伍長」とされることとなった<ref>明治32年10月25日勅令第411号（同年12月1日施行）。</ref>。

==== 明治32年12月1日以降 ====
下士官の階級のひとつ。曹長の下位、伍長の上。判任官。初叙は正八位勲八等功七級。海軍においては二等兵曹（1942年以降は一等兵曹に改称）に相当する。

ちなみに兵とは区別された。士官（尉・佐・将官）と一般兵士（卒・伍）の中間階級に位置する。

軍曹の位置づけはほぼ各国共通だが、階級の並列には若干の差異もあり功級では功七級以上功五級以下の級に叙せられた。任官区分では分隊長（平時は内務班長）に相当した。

'''Sergeant''' is a rank used in some form by most militaries, police forces, and other uniformed organizations around the world. Its origins are the Latin ''serviens'', "one who serves", through the French term ''Sergent''. 

==Military usage==

In most non-naval Privates and Commissioned Officers.
 
There are usually several ranks of Sergeant, each corresponding to greater experience and responsibility for the daily lives of the soldiers of larger units. 

The responsibilities of a Sergeant differ from army to army. In the British and most other Commonwealth armies a Sergeant is second-in-command (2IC) of a platoon (30-50 soldiers) or troop (the commander of a platoon typically being a 2nd Lieutenant or Lieutenant). In the US Army a Sergeant and Staff Sergeant are both ranks corresponding to command of a squad (9-11 soldiers), with a Sergeant First Class equating to a British/Commonwealth Staff Sergeant.  

In some armies, particularly the German army with its system of mission-based tactics,  sergeants have much greater responsibility and use of initiative than in other armies.

Sergeants Major are senior NCO appointments of a company/squadron, battalion, or regiment. In the US army company/troop senior NCO rank is Master Sergeant or First Sergeant; in British and most Commonwealth forces, sergeant major is an appointment e.g. company sergeant major (CSM) or Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM), whereas the rank is Warrant Officer Class 2 or 1. The Royal Navy and Royal Air Force have a single Warrant Officer grade. Although even the most senior sergeant major (or equivalent) is lower in rank than any officers, the position of Sergeant Major is in many ways more prestigious than junior officer ranks.

==Australia==
===Defence Forces===
'''Sergeant''' ('''SGT''') is a rank in both the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force. The ranks are equal to each other and the Royal Australian Navy rank of Petty Officer (PO).

However, the RAAF rank of Warrant Officer Class 2 (WO2) are equivalent to a Flight Sergeant.

In the Australian army the rank of Sergeant is above Corporal but below Warrant Officer Class 2. Although Staff Sergeant is technically between the two ranks, this rank is currently being phased out of the Australian Army. The insignia of a Sergeant in the Australian Army is three chevrons vertically adjacent to each other. Sergeants are non commissioned officers and are usually the 2IC's of infantry platoons or armoured sections.
===Police===
The rank of sergeant exists in all Australian police forces and is more senior than a constable (or senior constable), but less senior than an inspector.

There are generally two sergeant ranks:

*  Sergeant (SGT) (three chevrons); and

*  Senior Sergeant  (SEN/SGT) (three chevrons, crown surmounted by a laurel leaf)

Some state police forces have slightly different variations of the sergeant structure.

New South Wales Police Force, for example, have the additional rank of Incremental Sergeant (SGT) (three chevrons and a crown). This is an incremental progression, following appointment as a Sergeant for 7 years. This rank is less senior than that of a senior sergeant.

South Australia Police have the additional rank of Brevet Sergeant (two chevrons below an inverted arrow head) which is an authorization for an officer to temporarily hold a higher rank. A brevet sergeant is less senior than a sergeant.

Upon appointment as a Sergeant or Senior Sergeant within the New South Wales Police Force, the Sergeant is given a Warrant of Appointment under the Commissioners hand and seal.  In addition the Sergeant is given a Navy Blue backing (Which replaces a light blue backing to the officers police badge), a navy blue name plate (which replaces a light blue nameplate), and a silver chin strap positioned above his peaked cap on his headdress, replacing a black chinstrap.  These are symbols of the officers authority and standing.

As for slang, all three sergeants ranks are referred to as "Sergeant", "Boss", or "Sarge".  However at the New South Wales Police College, recruits must address all ranks of Sergeants as "Sergeant" and this is rigidly enforced by members of the NSW Protocol Unit, namely a Sergeant in the position of Supervisor Protocol Officer and the manager of the unit, a Senior Sergeant in the position of Senior Protocol Officer.

Sergeants are usually Team Leaders in charge of an entire team of Constables to Senior Constables at large stations, to being in charge of sectors involving several police stations. In country areas, sergeants are often in charge of an entire station and its constabulary. Senior Sergeants are usually in specialist areas and are in charge of Sergeants and thus act as middle management.

==Canada==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: 75px|right|Canadian Forces Sergeant's arm badge -->
'''Sergeant''' ('''Sgt''') (French: ''sergent'' or ''sgt'') is an Army Air Force Naval equivalent is senior non-commissioned officers (Sr NCOs).

In army units, Sergeants usually serve as section commanders; they may often be called to fill positions normally held by Warrant Officers, such as Platoon or Troop Warrant, Company Quartermaster Sergeant, Chief Clerk, etc.

The rank insignia of a Sergeant is a 3-bar chevron, worn point down, surmounted by a maple leaf. Embroidered rank badges are worn in "CF gold" thread on rifle green melton, stitched to the upper sleeves of the Service Dress jacket; as miniature gold metal and rifle-green enamel badges on the collars of the Army dress shirt and Army outerwear jackets; in "old-gold" thread on air force blue Operational Dress uniform. Sergeants are generally initially addressed as "Sergeant Bloggins" and thereafter as "Sergeant".

Colour Sergeant in the Canadian Forces is not a rank of Sergeant, but a Warrant Officer in one of the two Foot Guards regiments (the Governor General's Foot Guards and the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Likewise, a Sergeant-Major (including Regimental Sergeant-Major) is not a Sergeant rank, but an appointment held by a Master Warrant Officer or Chief Warrant Officer.

Sergeants generally mess and billet with Warrant Officers, Master Warrant Officers, and Chief Warrant Officers, and their naval counterparts, Chief Petty Officers and Petty Officers. Their mess on military bases or installations is generally named the Warrant Officers and Sergeants Mess.

Historically, the rank of sergeant was severely downgraded after Unification of the three services in 1968. An Army Sergeant before unification was generally employed in supervisory positions, such as the second in command of a platoon sized unit (ie an infantry Platoon Sergeant, or Troop Sergeant in an armoured unit). After unification he was downgraded in status to section commander, a job previously held by Corporals, and the former "Platoon/Troop Sergeant"s were replaced by "Platoon/Troop Warrant Officers."

==Finland==

thumb|The collar and sleeve insignia of ''Kersantti''

'''''Kersantti''''' is in Corporal.

Only a few NCO's in each conscript company reach the higher rank of full three-chevron kersantti. There's no difference between the 4-month group leader training and service time of alikersantti and kersantti; all start their group leader tour with the lower rank and the optional promotion is based on superior's assessment of individual performance and intended duties in the war-time organization; special roles such as that of Platoon Deputy Leader or Company First Sergeant are typically reserved for kersantti and upwards. 

A Corporal can also obtain the rank of Sergeant (and possibly above - the next rank being four-chevron '''''ylikersantti''''', which is comparable to Staff Sergeant) by participating some military refresher courses while in reserve, or by enlisting to (short-term) professional service in the military.

==France==
:''See the article '''Ranks in the French Army'''''

There are three sergeant ranks in France, although the most junior, contract sergeant, is rare now that conscription has been suspended. In general, the term ''sergent'' is used indifferently for both contract sergeant and career sergeant. Contract sergeant is classified as the lowest NCO<ref>The french military don't use the term NCO, preferring the term ''sous-officiers'', meaning "sub-officers" (compare to German ''unteroffizier'').</ref> rank, the rank below being chief corporal.

*'''Contract sergeant ''': ''Sergent sous contrat'': One chevron, gold or silver<ref>The color of the chevrons of the sergeant depends on his unit : the vast majority of infantry units uses gold, but a few of them, like the chasseurs alpins, uses silver.</ref>. <br />A rank used for junior sergeants, either conscripts or reservists. Junior to commonwealth sergeant but senior to commonwealth corporal. The rank insignia is used nowadays for NCOs-in-training.
*'''Career sergeant :''' ''Sergent de carrière'': Two chevrons. <br />Normal sergeant rank, though normally directly recruited from civilian life into this rank, so the rank implies less experience than for a  commonwealth sergeant. Normally simply referred to as sergeant, dropping the "''de carrière''". With long service, promotion to chief sergeant is automatic. Equivalent to a US sergeant. Roughly equivalent to, but slightly junior to, a commonwealth sergeant. 
*'''Chief Sergeant :''' ''Sergent-chef'': Three chevrons. <br />With long service, a sergeant's promotion to chief sergeant is automatic. This rank corresponds exactly to a US staff sergeant. There is no commonwealth equivalent, this rank lying between commonwealth staff sergeant and commonwealth sergeant. The rank may be said to be roughly equivalent to, but perhaps slightly superior to, a commonwealth sergeant. The next rank up is adjutant.

French sergeant ranks are used by the entire Air Force, by the Engineers, the Infantry, the Foreign Legion, the ''Gendarmerie Nationale. Other corps in the Army and the Gendarmerie use three equivalent ranks of ''maréchal des logis'' ("marshal of lodgings" in English) instead.

==Germany==
60px|right|German Sergeant's (Feldwebel) shoulder board
In the German language, the rank of Sergeant is known as '''''company, only one ''Zug'' (platoon) is under the command of an officer, while the other ''Zugführer'' (platoon leader) positions are held by ''Feldwebel''-ranked NCOs (typically ''Hauptfeldwebel'' and above).
In the German Navy the rank is called Bootsmann.

In the modern German Army, ''Feldwebel'' and ''Oberfeldwebel'' have a NATO rank code of OR-6, with ''Unteroffizier'' (historically considered generically equivalent to Corporal) and ''Stabsunteroffizier'' having a rank code of OR-5.

The rank order is: Feldwebel, Oberfeldwebel, Hauptfeldwebel, Stabsfeldwebel and Oberstabsfeldwebel.

==India and Pakistan==
===Army===
In the British Indian Army, the equivalent rank to Sergeant was '''Daffadar''' in cavalry regiments and '''Havildar''' in other units. These ranks are still used in the Indian Army and Pakistan Army.

===Air Force===
In the Indian Air Force the rank of Sergeant is above a Corporal and below of Junior Warrant Officer (JWO). The rank insignia is a three pointed-down chevron. The rank of Flight Sergeant is now obsolete with the responsibilities given to Junior Warrant Officer.

===Indian Navy===
In the Indian Navy, the rank of Petty Officer is the rough equivalent.

===Police===
In many metropolitan police forces in India e.g. Kolkata Police, a Sergeant is senior to an Assistant Sub-Inspector but junior to an Inspector. This rank would be at the same level as that of a Sub-Inspector. In some police forces, this rank is also known as Havildar.

==Ireland==
60px|right|Irish Army Sgt's Rank Slider
'''Sergeant''' ('''Sgt''') (''Sáirsint'' in Irish) is the second rank of non-commissioned officer within the Naval equivalent is Petty Officer (PO).

The Army rank insignia consists of three winged chevrons (or "stripes"). The Service Dress Insignia consists of three wavy red chevrons 9 cm wide bordered in yellow. The main infantry role of a Sergeant is as Second in Command of a platoon or commander of a Fire Support Section of a weapons platoon, such as an anti-tank or mortar platoon. Another role is that of Company Clerk and Instructor. There are higher ranks of Company Sergeant and Company Quartermaster Sergeant. Artillery Sergeants are usually assigned as Detachment and Section Commanders, as well as in administrative roles. The difference in roles of Sergeant and Corporal in the Artillery Corps is not as clearly defined as in the Infantry Corps.

'''Sergeant''' is also the second rank of NCO in the Irish Air Corps. Before 1994, the Air Corps was considered part of the Army and wore Army uniforms with distinct Corps Badges, but the same rank insignia. With the introduction of a unique Air Corps blue uniform in 1994, the same rank markings in a white colour were worn, before the introduction of a new three-chevron with wing rank marking. There are higher ranks of Flight Sergeant and Flight Quartermaster Sergeant.

Finally, '''sergeant''' is the second rank in an Garda Síochána.
