<!--SPELLING OF ALUMINIUM - Please see the talk page, this article is written using the British English spelling of "aluminium" and so 'ium' should be used.
However it also follows Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)#Element names for conventions on chemical names, so "sulfur", etc. should be maintained.-->
'''Aluminium''' (, ) or '''aluminum''' (, see ''spelling'' below) is a silvery white and ductile member of the boron group of chemical elements. It has the symbol '''Al'''; its atomic number is 13. It is not soluble in water under normal circumstances.
Aluminium is the most abundant metal in the crust, and the third most abundant element therein, after oxygen and silicon. It makes up about 8% by weight of the Earth’s solid surface. Aluminium is too reactive chemically to occur in nature as the free metal. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different minerals.<ref></ref> The chief source of aluminium is bauxite ore. 

Aluminium is remarkable for its ability to resist alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and very important in other areas of transportation and building. Its reactive nature makes it useful as a catalyst or additive in chemical mixtures, including being used in ammonium nitrate explosives to enhance blast power.

== Characteristics ==
Aluminium is a soft, durable, lightweight, yield strength of pure aluminium is 7–11 MPa, while stiffness of ductile, and easily machined, cast, and extruded.

galvanic reactions with alloyed copper.<ref name=polmear/> This corrosion resistance is also often greatly reduced when many aqueous salts are present however, particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals.

Aluminium atoms are arranged in an face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. Aluminium has a high stacking-fault energy of approximately 200 mJ/m².<ref>G. E. Dieter, ''Mechanical Metallurgy'', McGraw-Hill, 1988</ref>

Aluminium is one of the few metals that retain full silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component of silver paints. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the 200–400 nm (UV) and the 3000–10000 nm (far IR) regions, while in the 400–700 nm visible range it is slightly outdone by tin and silver and in the 700–3000 (near IR) by silver, gold, and copper.

Aluminium is a good thermal and gauss.<ref></ref>

== Isotopes ==

Dodd, ''Thunderstones and Shooting Stars'', pp. 89-90. ISBN 0-674-89137-6.</ref>

== Natural occurrence ==

In the Earth's crust, aluminium is the most abundant (8.13%) metallic element, and the third most abundant of all elements (after oxygen and silicon). However, because of its strong affinity to oxygen, it is almost never found in the elemental state; instead it is found in oxides or silicates.  Feldspars, the most common group of minerals in the earth's crust, are aluminosilicates. Native aluminium metal can be found as a minor phase in low oxygen fugacity environments, such as the interiors of certain volcanoes.<ref></ref>

Although aluminium is an extremely common and widespread element, the common aluminium minerals are not economic sources of the metal.  Almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the ore bauxite. Bauxite occurs as a weathering product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions.<ref>Guilbert, John M. and Carles F. Park, ''The Geology of Ore Deposits,'' Freeman, 1986, pp. 774-795 ISBN 0-7167-1456-6 </ref>

== Production and refinement ==
Although aluminium is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust (believed to be 7.5 to 8.1 percent), it is rare in its free form, occurring in oxygen-deficient environments such as Napoleon III, emperor of France, is reputed to have given a banquet where the most honoured guests were given aluminium utensils, while the other guests had to make do with gold.<ref></ref><ref>ChemMatters October 1990 Page 14</ref> The Washington Monument was completed, with the 100 ounce (2.8 kg) aluminium capstone being put in place on December 6, 1884, in an elaborate dedication ceremony. It was the largest single piece of aluminium cast at the time. At that time, aluminium was more expensive than silver, gold, or platinum. Aluminium has been produced in commercial quantities for just over 100 years. 

Aluminium is a strongly reactive metal that forms a high-energy chemical bond with oxygen.  Compared to most other metals, it is difficult to extract from ore, such as bauxite, due to the energy required to reduce aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). For example, direct reduction with carbon, as is used to produce iron, is not chemically possible, since aluminium is a stronger reducing agent than carbon.  Aluminium oxide has a melting point of about 2,000 °C. Therefore, it must be extracted by electrolysis.  In this process, the aluminium oxide is dissolved in molten cryolite and then reduced to the pure metal. The operational temperature of the reduction cells is around 950 to 980 °C. Cryolite is found as a mineral in Greenland, but in industrial use it has been replaced by a synthetic substance. Cryolite is a chemical compound of aluminium, sodium, and calcium fluorides: (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>). The aluminium oxide (a white powder) is obtained by refining bauxite in the Bayer process of Karl Bayer. (Previously, the Deville process was the predominant refining technology.)

The electrolytic process replaced the Wöhler process, which involved the reduction of anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium. Both of the electrodes used in the electrolysis of aluminium oxide are carbon. Once the ore is in the molten state, its ions are free to move around. The reaction at the cathode (negative electrode) is
:Al<sup>3+</sup> + 3 e<sup>−</sup> → Al

Here the aluminium ion is being reduced (electrons are added). The aluminium metal then sinks to the bottom and is tapped off.

At the anode (positive electrode), oxygen is formed:
:2 O<sup>2−</sup> → O<sub>2</sub> + 4 e<sup>−</sup>

This carbon anode is then oxidized by the oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide.
:O<sub>2</sub> + C → CO<sub>2</sub>
The anodes in a reduction cell must therefore be replaced regularly, since they are consumed in the process.

Unlike the anodes, the cathodes are not oxidized because there is no oxygen present, as the carbon cathodes are protected by the liquid aluminium inside the cells. Nevertheless, cathodes do erode, mainly due to electrochemical processes. After five to ten years, depending on the current used in the electrolysis, a cell has to be rebuilt because of cathode wear.

thumb|World production trend of aluminium
Aluminium electrolysis with the MJ/kg). The most modern smelters achieve approximately 12.8 kW·h/kg (46.1 MJ/kg). (Compare this to the heat of reaction, 31 MJ/kg, and the Gibbs free energy of reaction, 29 MJ/kg.) Reduction line currents for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 kA; state-of-the-art smelters <ref></ref> operate at about 350 kA. Trials have been reported with 500 kA cells.

Recovery of the metal via recycling has become an important facet of the aluminium industry. Recycling involves melting the scrap, a process that requires only five percent of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore. However, a significant part (up to 15% of input material) is lost as dross (ash-like oxide).<ref></ref> Recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the growing use of aluminium beverage cans brought it to the public consciousness.

Electric power represents about 20% to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium, depending on the location of the smelter. Smelters tend to be situated where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive, such as South Africa, the South Island of New Zealand, Australia, the People's Republic of China, the Middle East, Russia, Quebec and British Columbia in Canada, and Iceland.
thumb|right|Aluminium output in 2005
In 2005, the People's Republic of China was the top producer of aluminium with almost one-fifth world share, followed by Russia, Canada, and USA, reports the British Geological Survey.

Over the last 50 years, Australia has become a major producer of bauxite ore and a major producer and exporter of alumina.<ref></ref> Australia produced 62 million tonnes of bauxite in 2005. The Australian deposits have some refining problems, some being high in silica but have the advantage of being shallow and relatively easy to mine.<ref></ref>

== Chemistry ==
=== Oxidation state one ===

* AlH is produced when aluminium is heated in an atmosphere of hydrogen.
* Al<sub>2</sub>O is made by heating the normal oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, with silicon at 1800 °C in a vacuum.
* Al<sub>2</sub>S can be made by heating Al<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> with aluminium shavings at 1300 °C in a vacuum. It quickly disproportionates to the starting materials. The selenide is made in a parallel manner.
*AlF, AlCl and AlBr exist in the gaseous phase when the tri-halide is heated with aluminium.
Aluminium halides usually exist in the form AlX<sub>3</sub>.
e.g. AlF<sub>3</sub>, AlCl<sub>3</sub>, AlBr<sub>3</sub>, AlI<sub>3</sub> etc.

=== Oxidation state two ===
* Aluminium monoxide, AlO, is present when aluminium powder burns in oxygen.

=== Oxidation state three ===
* Fajans' rules show that the simple trivalent cation Al<sup>3+</sup> is not expected to be found in anhydrous salts or binary compounds such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The hydroxide is a weak base and aluminium salts of weak acids, such as carbonate, can't be prepared. The salts of strong acids, such as nitrate, are stable and soluble in water, forming hydrates with at least six molecules of water of crystallization.
* Aluminium hydride, (AlH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>n</sub>, can be produced from trimethylaluminium and an excess of hydrogen. It burns explosively in air. It can also be prepared by the action of aluminium chloride on lithium hydride in ether solution, but cannot be isolated free from the solvent.
* acetylide, Al<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, is made by passing acetylene over heated aluminium.
* Aluminium nitride, AlN, can be made from the elements at 800 °C. It is hydrolysed by water to form ammonia and aluminium hydroxide.
* Aluminium phosphide, AlP, is made similarly, and hydrolyses to give phosphine.
* Aluminium oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, occurs naturally as corundum, and can be made by burning aluminium in oxygen or by heating the hydroxide, nitrate or sulfate. As a gemstone, its hardness is only exceeded by diamond, boron nitride, and carborundum. It is almost insoluble in water.
* Aluminium hydroxide may be prepared as a gelatinous precipitate by adding ammonia to an aqueous solution of an aluminium salt. It is amphoteric, being both a very weak acid, and forming aluminates with alkalis. It exists in various crystalline forms.
* polymorphic.
* Aluminium iodide, (AlI<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, is a dimer with applications in organic synthesis.
* Aluminium fluoride, AlF<sub>3</sub>, is made by treating the hydroxide with HF, or can be made from the elements. It consists of a giant molecule which sublimes without melting at 1291 °C. It is very inert. The other trihalides are dimeric, having a bridge-like structure.
* Aluminium fluoride/water complexes: When aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution, they readily form complex ions such as AlF(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub><sup>+2</sup>, AlF<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup>, AlF<sub>6</sub><sup>-3</sup>. Of these, AlF<sub>6</sub><sup>-3</sup> is the most stable. This is explained by the fact that aluminium and fluoride, which are both very compact ions, fit together just right to form the octahedral aluminium hexafluoride complex. When aluminium and fluoride are together in water in a 1:6 molar ratio, AlF<sub>6</sub><sup>-3</sup> is the most common form, even in rather low concentrations.
* Organo-metallic compounds of empirical formula AlR<sub>3</sub> exist and, if not also giant molecules, are at least dimers or trimers. They have some uses in organic synthesis, for instance trimethylaluminium.
* Alumino-hydrides of the most electropositive elements are known, the most useful being lithium aluminium hydride, Li[AlH<sub>4</sub>]. It decomposes into lithium hydride, aluminium and hydrogen when heated, and is hydrolysed by water. It has many uses in organic chemistry, particularly as a reducing agent. The aluminohalides have a similar structure.

=== Clusters ===
In the journal ''Science'' of 14 January 2005 it was reported that clusters of 13 aluminium atoms (Al<sub>13</sub>) had been made to behave like an iodine atom; and, 14 aluminium atoms (Al<sub>14</sub>) behaved like an alkaline earth atom. The researchers also bound 12 iodine atoms to an Al<sub>13</sub> cluster to form a new class of polyiodide. This discovery is reported to give rise to the possibility of a new characterisation of the periodic table: superatoms. The research teams were led by Shiv N. Khanna (Virginia Commonwealth University) and A. Welford Castleman Jr (Penn State University).<ref></ref>

== Applications ==
=== General use ===
thumb|left|A piece of aluminium metal.
Aluminium is the most widely used non-ferrous metal.<ref></ref> Global production of aluminium in 2005 was 31.9 million tonnes. It exceeded that of any other metal except iron (837.5 million tonnes).<ref></ref>
Relatively pure aluminium is encountered only when corrosion resistance and/or workability is more important than strength or hardness. A thin layer of aluminium can be deposited onto a flat surface by physical vapor deposition or (very infrequently) chemical vapor deposition or other chemical means to form optical coatings and mirrors. When so deposited, a fresh, pure aluminium film serves as a good reflector (approximately 92%) of visible light and an excellent reflector (as much as 98%) of medium and far infrared.

Pure aluminium has a low tempered. Aluminium alloys form vital components of aircraft and rockets as a result of their high strength-to-weight ratio. Aluminium readily forms alloys with many elements such as copper, zinc, magnesium, manganese and silicon (e.g., duralumin). Today, almost all bulk metal materials that are referred to loosely as "aluminium," are actually alloys. For example, the common aluminium foils are alloys of 92% to 99% aluminium.<ref></ref>

Some of the many uses for aluminium metal are in:thumb|household aluminium foil

=== Aluminium alloys in structural applications ===
thumb|Aluminium foam

Aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures. Alloy systems are classified by a number system (ANSI) or by names indicating their main alloying constituents (ISO).

The strength and durability of aluminium alloys vary widely, not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy, but also as a result of heat treatments and manufacturing processes. A lack of knowledge of these aspects has from time to time led to improperly designed structures and gained aluminium a bad reputation. (See main article)

One important structural limitation of aluminium alloys is their fatigue strength.  Unlike steels, aluminium alloys have no well-defined fixed life rather than an infinite life.

Another important property of aluminium alloys is their sensitivity to heat.
Workshop procedures involving heating are complicated by the fact that aluminium, unlike steel, will melt without first glowing red. Forming operations where a annealing the stresses. 

The low melting point of aluminium alloys has not precluded their use in rocketry; even for use in constructing combustion chambers where gases can reach 3500&nbsp;K. The Agena upper stage engine used a regeneratively cooled aluminium design for some parts of the nozzle, including the thermally critical throat region.

=== Household wiring ===

Compared to copper, aluminium has about 65% of the conductivity by volume, although 200% by weight.  Traditionally copper is used as household wiring material.  In the 1960s aluminium was considerably cheaper than copper, and so was introduced for household electrical wiring in the United States, even though many fixtures had not been designed to accept aluminium wire.  However, in some cases the greater creep'' under steady sustained pressure (to a greater degree as the temperature rises), again loosening the connection.  Finally, Galvanic corrosion from the dissimilar metals increased the electrical resistance of the connection. 

All of this resulted in overheated and loose connections, and this in turn resulted in fires.  Builders then became wary of using the wire, and many jurisdictions outlawed its use in very small sizes in new construction.  Eventually, newer fixtures were introduced with connections designed to avoid loosening and overheating.  At first they were marked "Al/Cu", but they now bear a "CO/ALR" coding.  In older assemblies, workers forestall the heating problem using a properly-done crimp of the aluminium wire to a short "pigtail" of copper wire.  Today, new alloys, designs, and methods are used for aluminium wiring in combination with aluminium terminations.
