'''크림 고트어'''는 크림 반도에서 사용된 고트어의 방언이다. 크림 반도의 고립된 지역에서 사용된 언어로,18세기까지 존재하였다.

크림 고트어에 관해서는 몇 안되는 단편적인 기록밖에 남아 있지 않다. 고트어에 대해 알려진 것들은 대부분 16세기 플랑드르 대사이자 언어학자인 오지에 기스란 드 뷰벡크(Ogier Ghislain de Busbecq)의 서간문에 근거하고 있는데, 약 80개 정도의 단어가 기록되어 있으며 문법에 관해서는 뷰베크 자신의 탁월한 견해가 들어간 해석이 남아 있다.

크림 고트어는 그 음성학적 특징에서 고트어의 방언으로 인식되고 있다. 예를 들어,  (알)이라는 단어는 고트어의 게르만어적인 특징을 잘 나타내고 있다.

바이킹은 크림 고트족의 존재를 눈치채고 있었을지도 모른다. 규타사가<!-- en:Gutasaga -->가 전하는 바에 따르면 고트란드섬에 거주하는 주민의 3분의 1이 섬을 떠나 그리스의 섬들에 이주하게 되었을 때, 이주지인 그리스 섬들에서 고(古) 규트몰<!-- en:Old Gutnish -->과 거의 동일한 언어가 존재하는 것을 발견했다라는 룬 문자의 명문이 남아 있었기 때문이다.

'''Crimean Gothic''' was a Germanic dialect spoken by the Crimean Goths in some isolated locations in Crimea (now in Ukraine) until the late 18th century.

The existence of a Germanic dialect in the Crimea is attested in a number of sources from the 9th century to the 18th century. However, only a single source provides any details of the language itself: a letter by the Flemish ambassador Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, dated 1562 and first published in 1589, gives a list of some eighty words and a song supposedly in the language.

Busbecq's information is problematic in a number of ways: his informants were not unimpeachable (one was a Greek speaker who knew Crimean Gothic as a second language, the other a Goth who had abandoned his native language in favour of Greek); there is the possibility that Busbecq's transcription was influenced by his own Flemish tongue; there are undoubted misprints in the printed text, which is our only source.

Nonetheless, much of the vocabulary cited by Busbecq is unmistakably Germanic and was recognised by him as such:
* ''Apel''	"apple" (cf. Dutch ''appel'')
* ''Handa''	"hand"
* ''Schuuester'' "sister" (cf. German ''Schwester'')
* ''Hus''	"house"  (cf. German ''Haus'', Dutch ''huis'', Swedish ''hus'')
* ''Reghen''	"rain"   (cf. Dutch and German ''regen'')
* ''Singhen''	"sing"
* ''Geen''	"go" 	(cf. German ''gehen'' and Dutch ''gaan'')

Busbecq also cites a number of words  which he did not recognise but which we know have Germanic cognates:
*''ano''	"chicken" (cf. English ''hen'', German ''Hahn')
*''malthata''	"said" (cf. Old English ''maþelode'')

While the initial identification of this language as "Gothic" probably rests on ethnological rather than linguistic grounds - that is, the speakers were identified as Goths therefore the language must be Gothic - it shares a number distinctive phonological developments with the Gothic of Proto-Germanic *''-jj-'' into ''-ddj-'' (as in Ulfilian Gothic ''iddja'' "went" from PGmc. *''ejjon''), being from Proto-Germanic *''ajja-''.

There are also examples of features preserved in Crimean Gothic and Biblical Gothic but which have undergone changes in West and North Germanic. For example, both Crimean Gothic and Biblical Gothic preserve Germanic /z/ as a sibilant, while it became /r/ in all other Germanic dialects.

However, there are problems in assuming that Crimean Gothic represents simply a later stage in the development of the Gothic attested in Ulfilas' Bible. Some innovations in Biblical Gothic are not found in Crimean Gothic, for example:
* Crimean Gothic preserves Germanic /e/, whereas in Biblical Gothic it has become /i/, e.g. Crimean Gothic ''reghen'', ''suuester'', Biblical Gothic ''rign'', ''swister''
* Crimean Gothic preserves Germanic /u/ before /r/ whereas Biblical Gothic has /au/, e.g. Crimean Gothic ''vvurt'', Biblical Gothic ''waurþi''.
