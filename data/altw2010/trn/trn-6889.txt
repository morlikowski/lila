'''Lysaker''' stasjon ligger på Lysaker på Bærum-siden av grensen mellom Oslo og Bærum. Lysaker er Norges 3. største jernbanestasjon.

Lysaker stasjon ligger på Drammenbanen og har togforbindelse med Skøyen stasjon østover mot Oslo og mot Stabekk stasjon vestover. Flytoget, som trafikkerer Gardermobanen, har stoppested på stasjonen som i tillegg er et stopp på Askerbanen.

I 2006 startet en større ombygging av Lysaker stasjon. Dette skal koste rundt 1 mrd. norske kroner. Utvidelsen har medført en del kontroverser, spesielt med tanke på den forkasteste ''automatbanen''<ref>[http://www.trikken.no/asp/hoved.asp?NyhetsId=608&sideId=2&nyId=2 Trikken - Bybane til Fornebu vedtatt]</ref>, men også med tanke på den planlagte Fornebutrikken<ref>[http://www.budstikka.no/sec_nyheter/article134554.ece Budstikka - Krever forsikring om trikkeløsning]</ref> og utformingen av stasjonens plattformer.
