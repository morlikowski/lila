==Gradus graduatorum<ref name=SH>Thesaurus Anglicus Latinus "Smith-Hall"</ref>==

This article concerns the '''degrees of the University of Oxford'''. The system of academic degrees in the University of Oxford can be confusing to those not familiar with it. This is not merely because many degree titles date from the Middle Ages, but also because many changes have been haphazardly introduced in recent years. For example, the (medieval) B.D., B.M., B.C.L., etc., are postgraduate degrees, while the (modern) M.Phys., M.Eng., etc., are undergraduate degrees.

In postnominals, "University of Oxford" is normally abbreviated "''Oxon.''", which is short for ''(Academia) Oxoniensis'': e.g. M.A. (Oxon.), although within the university itself the abbreviation "Oxf" is now officially preferred.<ref>[http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/calendar/style.pdf ''Oxford University Calendar'': Notes on Style (30 March 2007)]</ref>

==Undergraduate degrees==
* Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)
* Bachelor of Fine Art (B.F.A.)

The Bachelor's degree is awarded soon after the end of the degree course (three or four years after matriculation). Until recently, all undergraduates studied for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The B.F.A. was introduced in 1978. Holders of the degrees of B.A. and B.F.A. both proceed in time to the degree of Master of Arts (M.A.). Note that the B.A is still awarded even for some science courses, such as the three-year Physics degree. The degree of Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) has never been awarded as an undergraduate degree at Oxford; it used to be awarded as a graduate qualification, however.

* Bachelor of Theology (B.Th.) 
* Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.)

The B.Th. is awarded primarily to students of the various Theological Colleges and Halls enjoying some sort of associate status with the University, such as St Stephen's House, Ripon College (Cuddesdon) [http://www.oxford.anglican.org/rcc/] and the former Westminster College, Oxford. Usually, these students are candidates for the ordained ministry of one of the mainstream Christian denominations, but may be drawn from any faith background or none at the discretion of the College or Hall. It should not be confused with the degree of bachelor of divinity (B.D.), which is a postgraduate degree.

The B.Ed. was formerly awarded to students at Westminster College of Education, Culham College of Education, and The Lady Spencer Churchill College of Education in conjunction with the University. 

===Undergraduate Master's degrees===
In the 1990s the degrees of Master of Engineering, etc., were introduced to increase public recognition of the four-year undergraduate science programmes in those subjects:

* Master of Biochemistry (M.Biochem.)
* Master of Chemistry (M.Chem.)
* Master of Computer Science (M.CompSci.)
* Master of Earth Sciences (M.EarthSc.)
* Master of Engineering (M.Eng.)
* Master of Mathematics (M.Math.)
* Master of Mathematics and Computer Science (M.MathCompSci.)
* Master of Mathematics and Philosophy (M.MathPhil.)
* Master of Physics (M.Phys.)
* Master of Physics and Philosophy (M.PhysPhil.)

The holders of these degrees have the academic dress and standing of BAs until the twenty-first term from matriculation, when they rank and dress as M.A.s. In Cambridge the same purpose has been accomplished by granting science undergraduates the additional degree of Master of Natural Sciences (M.Sci.) while continuing to award them the B.A. (and the subsequent M.A.). Note that biology undergraduates are still awarded the B.A./M.A., as are all other undergraduates, whether their degree courses last three years or four years.

==The degree of Master of Arts==

* Master of Arts (M.A.)

The degree of Master of Arts is awarded to B.A.s and B.F.A.s twenty-one terms (seven years) after matriculation, without further examination, upon the payment of a nominal fee. Recipients of undergraduate masters' degrees are not eligible to incept as M.A., but are afforded the same privileges after the statutory twenty-one terms.

This system dates from the Cambridge the bachelor's degree was postponed to a much later stage, and gradually developed a greater significance. While the requirements for the bachelor's degree increased, those for the master's degree gradually diminished. An examination along modern lines was introduced for the M.A. degree in 1800, but this was abolished in 1807. 

While the length of the undergraduate degree course has been shortened to three or four years, the University of Oxford still requires seven years to pass before the awarding of the M.A. The universities of Cambridge and Dublin have similar systems. In the four Scottish M.A. is awarded on completion of the four-year undergraduate degree course in the arts.

The shortening of the degree course reflects the fact that much of the teaching of the liberal arts was taken over by high schools, and undergraduates now enter university at a much older age. 

===Significance of the M.A.===

Traditionally the M.A. represented full membership of the University: until 2000, only M.A.s (as well as doctors of divinity, medicine, and civil law) were members of Chancellor and the professor of Poetry. Before then, members of the university who had not yet been made M.A. were known as "junior members", while those who were M.A.s were "senior members". 

Whilst recently there has been increasing criticism of being awarded a Master's degree whilst not doing any additional academic work,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/492180.stm BBC News | Education | Minister supports change to Oxbridge MA degrees<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/478163.stm BBC News | Education | Oxbridge MA degrees under threat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> supporters assert that the academic workload of a three-year Oxbridge undergraduate degree exceeds that of a four-year Masters course at many other British universities.<ref>[http://www.oxfordstudent.com/mt1999wk1/News/privilege_axed Privilege Axed - News - The Oxford Student - Official Student Newspaper<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://archive.thisisoxfordshire.co.uk/1998/8/10/84803.html University calms fears of losing automatic MA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Postgraduate degrees==
===Bachelors' degrees===

* Bachelor of Divinity (B.D.)
* Bachelor of Medicine & Bachelor of Surgery (B.M., B.Ch.)
* Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.)
* Bachelor of Letters (B.Litt.) (no longer awarded)
* Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) (no longer awarded)
* Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.)
* Bachelor of Philosophy (B.Phil.) (only now awarded in Philosophy)

In medieval times a student could not study some subjects until he had completed his study in the liberal arts. These were known as the higher faculties. The degrees in Science and Letters were added in the 19th century, and the degree in Philosophy was added in 1914 (although the D.Phil. is not considered a "higher doctorate"). The higher bachelor's degree programme is generally a taught programme of one or two years for graduates. In Medicine and Surgery this corresponds to the clinical phase of training, after which they are accorded the courtesy title "Doctor". The B.D. and B.Mus. are open only to Oxford graduates who have done well in the B.A. examinations in divinity and music respectively. The B.Phil./M.Phil. is a part-taught, part-research degree which is often a stepping stone to the D.Phil.
