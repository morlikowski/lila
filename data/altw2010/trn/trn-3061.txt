'''ジョー・ディマジオ'''（'''Joseph Paul DiMaggio''', アメリカメジャーリーグの元プロマーティネズ出身。。

==球歴==
ベーブ・ルースの引退後の1936年にニューヨーク・ヤンキースと契約。ルー・ゲーリッグがシーズン途中で引退した1939年には、いずれも初のMVPと首位打者に輝き、両雄の居なくなったヤンキースのナンバーワン・プレイヤーとなった。第二次世界大戦の従軍で数年間プレーしない時期もあったが、1951年の引退までに13年間プレー。通算361本塁打。また、1941年に達成した56試合連続安打は今もって破られていない、言わば不滅の大記録である。56試合連続安打に押されて、意外に知られていないが、デス･バレーと呼ばれるヤンキースタジアムの左中間スタンドに打球を放り込むほどのパワーも持ち合わせていた。

沢村栄治がマイナー時代の彼と対戦した逸話が残っている。フランク・オドール監督から「うちの4番から三振を奪ってみろ」と言われ、やっきになって打ち取りにいったがとうとう三振は奪えず、1本塁打を打たれた。オドール監督は、「ディマジオはいずれメジャーでクリーンアップを打つ打者だ」と予言。沢村はのちに「あれほどのレベルの打者が、アメリカではマイナーにもゴロゴロしてる」と日米の格差を述懐している。

グラウンドでの態度やファンへの誠実な対応は、野球選手の鑑とされた。同時代のライバル、テッド・ウィリアムズがあまりにも求道者的態度が過ぎてマスコミ受けが悪かったのとは好対照だった。当時のメジャーリーガーたちの間では「パーティに出たら、まずジョー・ディマジオを探せ。彼のいるところがつまり上席なのだ」と言い交わされるほどだったという。

一度見たらけっして忘れることのできないプレーヤーといわれ、また、The Washington Post'', 1999年3月8日 （2008年4月16日アクセス）</ref>、Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia "[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761577014/joe_dimaggio.html Joe DiMaggio]" （2008年4月16日アクセス）</ref>、ビリー・ジョエルのヒット曲『ハートにファイア』にもディマジオの名前が出てくる。1975年の映画『さらば愛しき女よ』では、主人公の私立探偵フィリップ・マーロウがディマジオの連続安打記録を気にし続けるという原作小説にはない描写が付け加えられているなど、ディマジオがいかにアメリカ人にとってヒーローであったかがうかがえる。そのため、ディマジオもそのイメージを保つ為に自分の節制にはとても厳しかったという。

どのような選手であったかを知るのに当時を知るある人物が語った次のディマジオ評が端的にそれを表しているといえよう。

「殿堂入りしている選手の中で彼より実績を残している選手が大勢いるとか、マリリン・モンローとの結婚が彼の名声を高めたとか述べる人物がいるが私に言わせれば
そんなことはどうでもいいことなんです。最も大事なことは野球界において殿堂入りしている偉大な選手を語るときに彼と比較できる選手はいないということなのです。」

彼の背番号'''5'''は、1951年の現役引退と共にヤンキースの永久欠番に指定されている。

現役最後の年となった1951年には日米野球で来日し、中日）から本塁打を打った翌日に、まだ試合が残っているにも関わらず突然帰国し、帰国してすぐに引退を発表している。そのホームランは、三塁を守っていた服部受弘（中日）が、「ジャンプして捕ろうとしたら、そのまま伸びてスタンドに入った」と言っていたといい、ディマジオにとっても印象的なホームランの一つだったようで、後年になっても、「俺がホームランを打ったピッチャー（杉下）は元気にしてるか？」と、杉下のことをよく尋ねていたという。

==引退後、晩年==
現役引退後、後進の指導などに力を尽くし、1970年代にはオークランド・アスレチックスの春季キャンプでの臨時コーチを務めている（この時の縁で、ディマジオの死後、臨時コーチ時につけていた背番号5が一時アスレチックスのホームスタジアムに掲げられた）。死の前年まで、古巣ヤンキースの開幕戦始球式はディマジオの務めであり、また後輩のヨギ・ベラとジョージ・スタインブレナーオーナーの対立においても仲裁に動くなど、非常に大きな影響力を持ってもいた。

近年になって、生前シシリア･マフィアとの関係があったことが明るみに出た。

'''Joseph Paul DiMaggio''', born '''Giuseppe Paolo DiMaggio, Jr.''' (IPA [dɪ'mædʒi.oʊ]) but was more properly pronounced "di-MA-zhee-oh" (IPA [di'mɑʒi.oʊ]).

DiMaggio was a 3-time MVP winner and 13-time All-Star who was widely hailed for his accomplishment on both offense and, as a center fielder, on defense, as well as for the grace with which he played the game. At the time of his retirement at age 36, he had the fifth-most career home runs (361) and sixth-highest slugging percentage (.579) in history.  He is also the only player in baseball history to be selected for the All-Star Game in every season he played.

A "picture-perfect" player, DiMaggio achieved a 56-game hitting streak (May 15 &ndash; July 16, 1941) that has been called baseball's most mythic achievement.<ref name="Arbesman-Strogatz 2008">{{Citation

A  poll conducted to coincide with the centennial of professional baseball voted him the sport's greatest living player.

==Early life==
DiMaggio was the eighth of nine children born to Sicilian immigrants, delivered by a Saint Paul, Giuseppe's favorite saint. The San Francisco when Joe was one year old.  

Giuseppe was a fisherman, as were generations of DiMaggios, and wanted his five sons to become the same. Joe recalled that he would do anything to get out of cleaning his father's boat, as the smell of dead fish made him nauseous. Giuseppe called him "lazy" and "good for nothing." Tom DiMaggio told Joe's biographer Maury Allen that Giuseppe's opposition was due to not understanding how baseball could help Joe "get away from the poverty" and make something of himself.

Joe was playing semi-pro when Vince, playing for the San Francisco Seals, talked his manager into letting Joe fill in at hit in a PCL-record 61 consecutive games: "Baseball didn't really get into my blood until I knocked off that hitting streak. Getting a daily hit became more important to me than eating, drinking or sleeping."

In 1934, his career almost ended. Going to his sister's house for dinner, he tore the jitney. The Seals, hoping to sell Joe for $100,000 now couldn't give him away; the batted .398 with 154 RBIs and 34 HRs, led the Seals to the  PCL title, and was named the League's MVP.

Touted by sportswriters as 1932, but, thanks in large part to their sensational rookie, they won the next four Fall Classics. In total, DiMaggio led the Yankees to nine titles in thirteen years.

DiMaggio was an outstanding player, as respected for his smooth, effortless fielding as for his hitting. Hank Greenberg told SPORT magazine in its September 1949 issue that DiMaggio covered so much ground in center field that the only way to get a hit against the Yankees was "to hit 'em where Joe wasn't."

On Brooklyn Dodgers that was turned over to the New York Giants and leaked to the press led him to announce his retirement on 11 December 1951.  

thumb|left|Joe DiMaggio's plaque at the [[Baseball Hall of Fame.]]
He became eligible for the Brooklyn Dodgers had offered him their managerial job in 1953, but he turned it down. He was not elected to the Hall until 1955; the rules were revised in the interim, with DiMaggio and Ted Lyons excepted, extending the waiting period from one year to five.

He might have had better power-hitting statistics had his home park not been Yankee Stadium. As "The House That Ruth Built", its nearby right field favored the Babe's left-handed power. For right-handed hitters, its deep left and center fields could be a nightmare: Mickey Mantle recalled that he and Whitey Ford would count the blasts DiMaggio hit that would have been home runs anywhere else, but, at the Stadium, were merely long outs (Ruth himself fell victim to that problem, as he also hit many long fly outs to center). Bill James calculated that DiMaggio lost more home runs due to his home park than any player in history. Left-center field went as far back as 457ft, compared to ballparks today where left-center rarely reaches 380ft. An illustration is the oft-replayed clip of Al Gionfriddo's catch in the 1947 World Series, which was close to the 415 foot mark in left-center. Had it happened in Ebbets Field, it would have been well into the seats for a home run. To paint an accurate picture on how affected DiMaggio was by Yankee Stadium; He hit 148 home runs in 3,360 at-bats at home. In contrast, hit 213 home runs in 3,461 at-bats on the road. His slugging percentage at home was .546. On the road, it was .610. His on-base percentage at Yankee Stadium was .391. Away, it was .405. He drove in 720 RBI at home. 817 on the road. When you multiply his road totals by two, you get 426 home runs in 13 seasons, at a pace in which he would hit one home run every 16.2 at-bats (which would be good for 30th all-time.) Expert statistician, Bill Jenkinson, elaborated further on this;

''From: The Year Babe Ruth Hit 104 Home Runs, by Bill Jenkinson:

<blockquote>
For example, Joe DiMaggio was acutely handicapped by playing at Yankee Stadium. Every time he batted in his home field during his entire career, he did so knowing that it was physically impossible for him to hit a home run to the half of the field directly in front of him. That's right! If you look at a baseball field from foul line to foul line, it has a 90-degree radius. From the power alley in left center field (430 in Joe's time) to the fence in deep right center field (407 feet), it is 45-degrees. And Joe DiMaggio never hit a single home run over the fences at Yankee Stadium in that 45-degree graveyard. It was just too far. Joe was plenty strong; he routinely hit balls in the 425-foot range. But that just wasn't good enough in cavernous Yankee Stadium. Like Ruth, he benefited from a few easy homers each season due to the short foul line distances. But he lost many more than he gained by constantly hitting long fly outs toward center field. Whereas most sluggers perform better on their home fields, Joe D hit only 41 percent of his career home runs in the Bronx. In his day, DiMaggio recorded 148 homers at Yankee Stadium. If he had hit the same exact pattern of batted balls with a typical modern stadium as his home, he would have belted about 225 homers during his home field career.
</blockquote>
''

In 1949, Boston Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey and Yankees GM Larry MacPhail verbally agreed to trade DiMaggio for Ted Williams, but MacPhail refused to include Yogi Berra<ref> http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/baseballrumors.html</ref>. Had the deal gone through, Williams could have benefited from Yankee Stadium's short right-center fence while DiMaggio could have thrived at Fenway Park with its Green Monster.

==Year in Urban Militia==
Following the U.S. entrance in Atlantic City as a physical education instructor during his 31-month stint, and played baseball.

Giuseppe and Rosalia DiMaggio were among the thousands of German, Japanese and Italian immigrants classified as "enemy aliens" after Pearl Harbor was attacked. They had to carry photo ID booklets at all times, were not allowed to travel more than five miles from their home without a permit, and Giuseppe's boat was seized. Rosalia became an American citizen in 1944, Giuseppe in 1945.

Years after he had hung up his spikes, DiMaggio was always a sought after celebrity when he came back to New York city. In Mangano family boss, Anthony "Little Augie Pisano" Carfano, a Luciano family capo. Years later, when he recalled the incident for detectives, he said that he was greatly disturbed when his agent told him later who he had met.

==Married life==
===Dorothy Arnold===

In January 1938, DiMaggio met actress Dorothy Arnold on the set of ''Manhattan Merry Go-Round''. They married at San Francisco's Saints Peter and Paul Roman Catholic Church on November 19, 1939 as 20,000 well-wishers jammed the streets.

Even before their son Joseph III was born, the marriage was in trouble. DiMaggio was like many ballplayers: a high-school dropout whose life revolved around the game. While not the New York social figure that Broadway's June O'Dea, would drag their husbands from one Los Angeles.

The relationship continued off and on. Dorothy reportedly promised Joe she would wait for him to return from 1946 training camp, but married another man. 

===Marilyn Monroe===
According to her autobiography, stereotypical jock. Both were at different points in their lives: the just-retired Joe wanted to settle down; Marilyn's career was taking off. Their elopement at San Francisco City Hall on January 14, 1954 was the culmination of a courtship that had captivated the nation.

The relationship was loving yet complex, marred by his jealousy and her ambition. DiMaggio biographer Richard Ben Cramer asserts it was also violent. One incident allegedly happened after the skirt-blowing scene in ''East Coast correspondent Bill Kobrin told the ''Palm Springs Desert Sun'' that it was Billy Wilder's idea to turn the shoot into a circus: "... every time her dress came up and the crowd started to get excited, DiMaggio just blew up." The couple then had a "yelling battle" in the theater lobby. When she filed for divorce 274 days after the wedding, Oscar Levant quipped it proved that no man could be a success in two pastimes.

An August 1, 1956 International News wire photo of DiMaggio with Lee Meriwether announced their engagement, but Cramer wrote that it was a rumor started by Walter Winchell. He was later linked to 1957 Miss America Marian McKnight, who won the crown with a Marilyn act. Marilyn biographer Donald Spoto claimed they were "very close to marrying" but she denies it.<ref>[http://www.hartsvillemessenger.com/Lifestyles/050520_lifestyles4.php South Carolina’s first 'Miss America', Marian McKnight]</ref> Biographers and news reports also linked him to Liz Renay, Cleo Moore, Marlene Dietrich, Gloria DeHaven, and Elizabeth Ray, but he never publicly confirmed any involvement.

DiMaggio re-entered Marilyn's life as her marriage to Best Song nominee "The Second Time Around" to them at the 33rd Academy Awards.

According to biographer Maury Allen, Joe was so alarmed at how Marilyn had returned to her self-destructive ways, falling in with people he felt detrimental to her (including Frank Sinatra and his "Rat Pack"), he quit his job with a military post-exchange supplier on August 1, 1962 to ask her to remarry him. But before he could, she was found dead on August 5. Her death was deemed a probable suicide but is subject to endless conspiracy theories. Devastated, he claimed her body and arranged her funeral, barring Hollywood's elite. He had a half-dozen red roses delivered 3 times a week to her crypt for the next 20 years. Unlike her other two husbands or other men who knew her intimately (or claimed to) he refused to talk about her publicly or write a tell-all. He never remarried.

==Death==
left|thumb|DiMaggio's grave
Following lung cancer surgery on October 14, 1998, DiMaggio fell ill again December 11. The attack forced his lawyer, Morris Engelberg, to admit that the positive reports he had been feeding to the press were greatly exaggerated. He claimed Joe made him promise not to tell even his family about his condition.

DiMaggio died on premature obituary; Engelberg claimed he and DiMaggio were watching TV and saw it. His hospice worker who cared for him gave a radically different account to ''The New York Post''.

DiMaggio is interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California. In his eulogy, Dom DiMaggio declared that his brother had everything "except the right woman to share his life with", a remark seeming to confirm the family's disapproval of Monroe. Richard Ben Cramer told the ''New York Times'' that Dom cooperated with him on his controversial biography, and got other family members to do likewise. In an eerie coincidence, Joe DiMaggio's estranged son, Joe, Jr., died later that same year.

The equally controversial Engelberg offered dozens of signed bats on Shop At Home, for $3,000 each, weeks before DiMaggio died. In April 1999, he sued the City of San Francisco to stop its plan to name the North Beach park, where Joe learned to play baseball, after him. That June, he sold hundreds of items to a collectibles dealer, including baseballs DiMaggio signed on his deathbed, and offered Joe's personal effects at a Sotheby's auction.
