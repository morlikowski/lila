'''.ai''' is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Anguilla. It is administered by the government of Anguilla.

Registrations within '''off.ai''', '''com.ai''', '''net.ai''', and '''org.ai''' are available unrestrictedly, worldwide, but don't appear to be getting much use.  Until recently, second level registrations within '''.ai''' seemed to be available only to residents of Anguilla and are used to some extent for sites based there, but there was no indication on the official registry site of how to register them. However as of 26 June 2006, they are available for anyone to register (according to the registry site at nic.com.ai).
