The '''MQ-1 Predator''' is an Bosnia, Serbia, Iraq, and Yemen.  It is remote-controlled by humans, not an autonomous aircraft. 

The MQ-1 Predator is a system, not just an aircraft. The fully operational system consists of four air vehicles (with sensors), a ground control station (GCS), a Predator primary satellite link communication suite, and 55 people. In the over-all U.S. Air Force integrated UAV system the Predator is considered a "Tier II" vehicle.<ref>[http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/cc/uav.html USAF Tier system scheme]</ref>

The Predator system was initially designated the '''RQ-1 Predator''', with the "R" is the Department of Defense designation for reconnaissance, "Q" means unmanned aircraft system. The "1" describes it as being the first of a series of aircraft systems built for unmanned reconnaissance. Pre-production systems were designated as RQ-1A, while the RQ-1B (not to be confused with the RQ-1 Predator B, which became the MQ-9 Reaper) denotes the baseline production configuration. It should be emphasized that these are designations of the ''system'' as a unit. The actual aircraft themselves were designated RQ-1K for pre-production models, and RQ-1L for production models.<ref name="vector">[http://www.vectorsite.net/twuav.html Modern Endurance UAVs]</ref> In 2002, the Air Force officially changed the designation to MQ-1 (the "M" designates multi-role) to reflect its growing use as an armed aircraft.<ref>[http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=122 USAF MQ-1 factsheet]</ref>

From April through May, 1995, the Predator ACTD aircraft were flown as a part of the Roving Sands 1995 exercises in the U.S. The exercise operations were successful, and this led to the decision to deploy the system to the Balkans later in the summer of 1995.<ref name="FAS"/> 

Cost for an early production Predator was about $3.2 million USD.<ref name="vector"/> 

The CIA arranged for Air Force teams trained by the 11th Reconnaissance Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada,  to fly the agency's Predators.  "First in Bosnia and then in Kosovo, CIA officers began to see the first practical returns ..."<ref>Steve Coll, ''Ghost Wars'' (Penguin, 2005 edn), pp.529 and 658 note 6.</ref>

By the time of the Afghan campaign, the Air Force had acquired 60 Predators, and lost 20 of them in action. Few if any of the losses were from enemy action, the worst problem apparently being foul weather, particularly icy conditions. Some critics within the Pentagon saw the high loss rate as a sign of poor operational procedures. In response to the losses caused by cold weather flight conditions, a few of the later Predators obtained by the USAF were fitted with deicing systems, along with an uprated turbocharged engine and improved avionics. This improved "Block 1" version was referred to as the "RQ-1B", or the "MQ-1B" if it carried munitions; the corresponding air vehicle designation was "RQ-1L" or "MQ-1L".

===Command and sensor systems===
During the campaign in the former Yugoslavia, a Predator's pilot would sit with several payload specialists in a van near the runway of the drone's operating base.  (In its Balkan operation, the CIA secretly flew Predators out of Hungary and Albania.)  Direct radio signals controlled the drone's takeoff and initial ascent. Then communications shifted to military satellite networks linked to the pilot's van.  Pilots experienced a delay of several seconds between tugging their joysticks and the drone's response.  But by 2000,

<blockquote>
improvements in communications systems [perhaps by use of the USAF's JSTARS system] now made it possible, at least in theory, to fly the drone remotely from great distances. It was no longer necessary to use close-up radio signals during the Predator's takeoff and ascent. The entire flight could be controlled by satellite from any command center with the right equipment.  The CIA proposed to attempt over Afghanistan the first fully remote Predator flight operations, piloted from [the agency's headquarters at] Langley.<ref>Steve Coll, ''Ghost Wars'' (Penguin, 2005 edn), pp.529-32.</ref>
</blockquote> 

The Predator air vehicle and sensors are controlled from the ground station via a C-band K<sub>u</sub>-band satellite data link for beyond-line-of-sight operations. During flight operations the crew in the ground control station is a pilot and two sensor operators. The aircraft is equipped with Multi-spectral Targeting System, a color nose camera (generally used by the pilot for flight control), a variable aperture day-TV camera, and a variable aperture infrared camera (for low light/night).  Previously, Predators were equipped with a synthetic aperture radar for looking through smoke, clouds or haze, but lack of use validated its removal to reduce weight. The cameras produce full motion video and the synthetic aperture radar produced still frame radar images. There is sufficient bandwidth on the datalink for two video sources to be used at one time, but only one video source from the sensor ball can be used at any time due to design limitations.  Either the daylight variable aperture or the infrared electro-optical sensor may be operated simultaneously with the synthetic aperture radar, if equipped.

All Predators are equipped with a laser designator that allows the pilot to identify targets for other aircraft and even provide the laser-guidance for manned aircraft.  This laser is also the designator for the AGM-114 Hellfire that are carried on the MQ-1.

===Deployment methodology===

Each Predator air vehicle can be disassembled into six main components and loaded into a container nicknamed "the coffin." This enables all system components and support equipment to be rapidly deployed worldwide. The largest component is the ground control station and it is designed to roll into a C-130 Hercules. The Predator primary satellite link consists of a 6.1 meter (20 ft) satellite dish and associated support equipment. The satellite link provides communications between the ground station and the aircraft when it is beyond line-of-sight and is a link to networks that disseminate secondary intelligence. The RQ-1A system needs 1,500 by 40 meters (5,000 by 125 ft) of hard surface runway with clear line-of-sight to each end from the ground control station to the air vehicles. Initially, all components needed be located on the same airfield.

Currently, the US Air Force uses a concept called "Remote-Split Operations" where the satellite datalink is located in a different location and is connected to the GCS through fiber optic cabling.  This allows Predators to be launched and recovered by a small "Launch and Recovery Element" and then handed off to a "Mission Control Element" for the rest of the flight.  This allows a smaller number of troops to be deployed to a forward location, and consolidates control of the different flights in one location.  

The improvements in the MQ-1B production version include an ARC-210 radio, an APX-100 IFF/SIF with mode 4, a glycol-weeping “wet wings” ice mitigation system, up-graded turbo-charged engine, fuel injection, longer wings, dual alternators as well as other improvements.

On M/RQ-9 aircraft to be used within U.S. civilian airspace to search for survivors of disasters. Requests had been made in 2005 for the aircraft to be used in search and rescue operations following Hurricane Katrina, but because there was no FAA authorization in place at the time, the assets were not used. The Predator's infrared camera with digitally-enhanced zoom has the capability of identifying the heat signature of a human body from an altitude of 3 km (10,000 feet), making the aircraft an ideal search and rescue tool.<ref>[http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123024467 SSgt Amy Robinson, "FAA Authorizes Predators to seek survivors," August 2, 2006]</ref>

The longest known Predator flight was 40 hours, 5 minutes.<ref>[http://www.uavforum.com/library/librarian.htm UAV Librarian desk]</ref>

===Armed version development===

The Air Force handed the Predator over to the service's Big Safari office after the Kosovo campaign in order to accelerate tests of the UAV in a strike role, fitted with reinforced wings and stores pylons to carry munitions, as well as a laser target designator. This effort led to a series of tests, on February 21, 2001, in which the Predator fired three Hellfire anti-armor missiles, scoring hits on a stationary tank with all three missiles. The scheme was put into service, with the armed Predators given the new designation of MQ-1A. Given that a Predator is very unobtrusive and the Hellfire is supersonic, such a combination gives little warning of attack.<ref name="vector"/><ref>[http://www.fas.org/irp/program/collect/docs/man-ipc-predator-010228.htm ''Predator missile launch test totally successful'']</ref>

In the winter of 2000-2001, after seeing the results of Predator reconnaissance in Afghanistan (see below), Cofer Black, head of the CIA's Counterterrorist Center (CTC), became a "vocal advocate" of arming the Predator with missiles to target Osama bin Laden in the country.  He also believed that CIA pressure and practical interest was causing the USAF's armed Predator program to be significantly accelerated.  Black, and "Richard", who was in charge of the CTC's Bin Laden Issue Station, continued to press during 2001 for a Predator armed with Hellfire missiles.

Further weapons tests occurred between May 22 and June 7, 2001, with mixed results.  While missile accuracy was excellent, there were some problems with missile fusing ..."  In the first week of June, in the Nevada Desert, a Hellfire missile ''was'' successfully launched on a replica of bin Laden's Afghanistan Tarnak residence.  A missile launched from a Predator exploded inside one of the replica's rooms; it was concluded that any people in the room would have been killed. However, the armed Predator did not go into action before 9/11.<ref>Steve Coll, ''Ghost Wars'' (Penguin, 2005 edn), pp.534, 548-9; [http://www.geocities.com/libertystrikesback/afghans.html#Predator The CIA and the Predator Drone (2000-1)]; [http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing8/tenet_statement.pdf Statement of CIA chief Tenet to 9/11 Commission, March 24, 2004], p.15; Barton Gellman, "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A8734-2002Jan19?language=printer A Strategy's Cautious Evolution]", ''Washington Post'',Jan. 20, 2002, p.A01.</ref>

The Air Force has also investigated using the Predator to drop battlefield ground sensors, and to carry and deploy the "Finder" mini-UAV.<ref name="vector"/>

===NASA and NPGS unarmed research versions===
Two unarmed versions, known as the '''General Atomics ALTUS''' were built, ALTUS I for the Naval Postgraduate School and ALTUS II for the NASA ERAST Project in 1997 and 1996, respectively.

===MQ-1C Warrior===

The U.S. Army selected the '''MQ-1C Warrior''' as the winner of the Extended-Range Multi-Purpose UAV competition August 2005, and the type is due to become operational in 2009.
