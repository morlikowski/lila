thumb|Cecil Rhodes.
'''Cecil John Rhodes''' (5 de Julho de 1853 &mdash; 26 de Março de 1902) foi um homem de negócios inglês e o fundador da Rodésia, actual Zimbabué. Foi também uma personagem essencial na construção do caminho de ferro que ligou o Cairo, no Egipto, ao Cabo, na África do Sul.

Nascido no condado de Hertfordshire, Cecil foi o quinto filho de Francis William Rodhes e da sua segunda mulher, Louisa Peacock. Teve onze irmãos, entre eles duas raparigas.

Com dezanove anos converteu 3000 libras que um tio lhe havia dado, com a idéia de cultivar algodão, em licenças para explorar uma mina de diamantes em Kimberley, na África do Sul, associado a John X Merrimam e C. D. Rudd, que mais tarde o acompanhariam na fundação De Beers Mining Company.

Em 1872, Cecil sofreu um ataque de coração, mas, conseguiu se recuperar. Foi então que começou a investigar as possibilidades de descobrir ouro no interior africano. Para isso, os irmãos Rhodes marcharam para norte, chegando a Mafeking. Porém, no ano seguinte, ao anunciar-se que a mina mais rica de Kimberley estava esgotada, Cecil ficou com todas as licenças que lhe ofereceram e ficou rico ao descobrir mais minas de diamantes, as quais deixou aos cuidados do seu sócio, Rudd, pois voltou para Inglaterra, com o objectivo de completar os seus estudos. Para tal inscreveu-se no Oriel College e não voltou a África antes de 1876. 

Em Abril de 1880, associado a Rudd, fundou a De Beers Mining Company, um investimento de 200.000 libras. Assim, em 1885, já controlava mais de 50% da economia de Kimberley.

Em 1886, ao ser descoberta uma mina de ouro em Joanesburgo, Cecil Rhodes compra grande parte desta.

Cecil também usou a sua fortuna para conseguir um dos seus sonhos: expandir o Império Britânico por África, onde fundou a Rodésia, o actual Zimbabué, feito pelo qual é mais conhecido.

==Education==

Rhodes attended the Oxford, which reinforced his own attachment to the cause of British All Souls College and a director of the British South Africa Company, and Charles Metcalfe. His university career engendered in him an admiration for the Oxford "system", which was eventually to mature into his scholarship scheme: "Wherever you turn your eye—except in science—an Oxford man is at the top of the tree".

While attending Freemason. Although his initial view of it was not approving, he continued to be a Freemason until his death in 1902. The failures of the Freemasons, in his mind, later caused him to envisage his own secret society with the goal of bringing the entire world under British rule.<ref name=thomas/>

==Diamonds==
|thumb|100px|left|The [[Rhodesian General Service Medal, awarded to Rhodesian armed forces during the Rhodesian Bush War / Second Chimurenga. The medal bears Rhodes' portrait.]]
Whilst at Oxford, Rhodes continued to prosper in Kimberley. Before his departure for Oxford, he and C.D. Rudd had moved from the Kimberley mine to invest in the more costly claims of what was known as old De Beers (Vooruitzicht) which owed its name to Johannes Nicolaas de Beer and his brother, Diederik Arnoldus de Beer, who were occupants of the farm, which with the entire Griqualand West Region belonged to the Voortrekker great-great-grandfather of Claudine Fourie-Grosvenor.<!-- Who is Claudine Fourie-Grosvenor? -->  He had allowed various Afrikaner families including the De Beers to reside on the land after he had purchased the entire Region from the Modder River via the Vet River up to the Vaal River from Mr. David Danser, a Koranna Chief in the area, in 1839. This included the Diamond Fields and later named Kimberley too. Rhodes and his associates, who had proceeded North from the Cape to forcibly take the land, hastily paid these two brothers a sum of money after writing out a certificate supposedly stating that the farm belonged to the brothers.<!--Citation from a renowned SA Author as well as British Military Intelligence Archival Records of the time.-->

In 1874 and 1875, the diamond fields were in the grip of depression, but Rhodes and Rudd were among those who stayed to consolidate their interests. They believed that diamonds would be numerous in the hard blue ground that had been exposed after the softer, yellow layer near the surface had been worked out. During this time, the technical problem of clearing out the water that was flooding the mines became serious and he and Rudd obtained the contract for pumping the water out of the three main mines. It was during this period that Jim B. Taylor, still a young boy and helping to work his father's claim, first met Rhodes.

On 12 March 1880, Rhodes and Rudd launched the De Beers Mining Company after the amalgamation of a number of individual claims. With £200,000<ref>£200,000 (1880) = ~£12.9m (2004) =~ $22.5m ([http://measuringworth.com/calculators/ppoweruk/ The Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1264 to 2006])</ref> of capital, the Company, of which Rhodes was secretary, owned the largest interest in the mine.

==Politics in South Africa==
In 1880, Rhodes prepared to enter public life at the Cape. With the incorporation of Griqualand West into the Cape Colony in 1877, the area obtained six seats in the Cape House of Assembly. Rhodes chose the constituency of Barkly West, a rural constituency in which Boer voters predominated. Barkly West remained faithful to Rhodes even after the Jameson Raid, and he continued as its member until his death.

When Rhodes became a member of the Cape Parliament, the chief goal of the assembly was to help decide the future of Basutoland, where the ministry of Sir Gordon Sprigg was trying to restore order after a rebellion, the Gun War, in 1880. The ministry had precipitated the revolt by applying its disarmament policy to the Basuto. In 1890, Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony and implemented laws that would benefit mine and industry owners. He introduced the Glen Grey Act to push black people from their lands and make way for industrial development.

Rhodes' policies were instrumental in the development of British imperial policies in Transvaal. He often disagreed with the Transvaal government's policies, and felt he could use his money and his power to overthrow the Boer government and install a British colonial government supporting mine-owners' interests in its place. In 1895, Rhodes supported an attack on the Transvaal, the infamous Frank Rhodes, to jail in Transvaal on high treason, nearly resulted in his hanging, and led to the outbreak of both the Second Matabele War and the Second Boer War.

==Expanding the British Empire==
===Rhodes and the Imperial Factor===
thumb|[[Cartoon by Punch'' after Rhodes announced plans for a telegraph line from Cape Town to Cairo.]]
Rhodes used his wealth and that of his business partner mineral concessions from the most powerful chiefs. Rhodes' competitive advantage over other mineral prospecting companies was his combination of wealth and the 'imperial factor', his use of the British Government: he made friendships with its local representatives, the British Commissioners, and through them organised British protectorates over the mineral concession areas via separate but related treaties, conferring both legality and security for mining operations. He could then win over more investors. Imperial expansion and capital investment went hand in hand.<ref name="Parsons">Neil Parsons: "A New History of Southern Africa, Second Edition." Macmillan, London (1993), pp 179–181.</ref>

The imperial factor was a double-edged sword: Rhodes did not want it to mean that the Portuguese, the Germans or the Boers from moving in to south-central Africa.

Rhodes' companies and agents cemented these advantages by obtaining many mining concessions, as exemplified by the Rudd and Lochner Concessions.<ref name="Parsons" />

===Treaties, concessions and charters===
Rhodes had already tried and failed to get a mining concession from John Moffat, son of the missionary Robert Moffat, who was trusted by Lobengula, to persuade the latter to sign a treaty of friendship with Britain, and to look favourably on Rhodes' proposals. His agent, Francis Thompson, who had travelled to Bulawayo in the company of Charles Rudd and Rochfort Maguire, assured Lobengula that no more than ten white men would mine in Matabeleland, but this was left out of the actual document Lobengula signed, the Rudd Concession. Furthermore it stated that the mining companies could do anything necessary to their operations. When Lobengula discovered later what the concession really meant, he tried to renounce it, but the British Government ignored him.<ref name="Parsons"/>

Armed with the Rudd Concession, in 1889 Rhodes obtained a charter from the British Government for his British South Africa Company (BSAC) to rule, police and make new treaties and concessions from the Limpopo River to the great lakes of Central Africa. He obtained further concessions and treaties north of the Zambezi, such as those in Barotseland (the Lochner Concession with King Lewanika in 1890, which was similar to the Rudd Concession), and in the Lake Mweru area (Alfred Sharpe's 1890 Kazembe concession). Rhodes also sent Sharpe to get a concession over mineral-rich Katanga, but met his match in ruthlessness: when Sharpe was rebuffed by its ruler Msiri, King Leopold II of Belgium obtained a concession over Msiri's dead body for his Congo Free State.<ref>See article on Msiri for details and references.</ref>

Rhodes also wanted Bechuanaland Protectorate (now Botswana) under the BSAC charter but three Tswana kings including Khama III travelled to Britain and won over British public opinion for it to remain governed by London. Rhodes commented: "It is humiliating to be utterly beaten by these niggers".<ref name="Parsons"/>

The British Nyasaland, today's Malawi) owing to the presence there of Scottish missionaries trying to end the slave trade. Rhodes paid much of the cost so that the British Central Africa Commissioner, Sir Harry Johnston (and his successor, Alfred Sharpe) would assist with security in the BSAC's north-eastern territories. Johnston shared Rhodes' expansionist views, but he and his successors were not as pro-settler as Rhodes and disagreed on dealings with Africans.

===Rhodesia===
The BSAC had its own police force, which was used to control Rand" from the ancient gold mines of the Shona, but the gold deposits were on a much smaller scale, so many of the white settlers who accompanied the British South Africa Company to Mashonaland became farmers. When the Ndebele and the Shona—the two main, but rival tribes—separately rebelled against the coming of the white settlers, the British South Africa Company defeated them in the two Matabele Wars (1893–94; 1896–97). Shortly after learning of the assassination of the Ndebele prophet, Mlimo, at the hands of the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, thus ending the Second Matabele War.<ref name="farwell"></ref>

By the end of 1894, the territories over which the BSAC had concessions or treaties, collectively called "Zambesia" after the Zambezi River flowing through the middle, comprised an area of 1,143,000 km² between the North-Western and North-Eastern Rhodesia were used from 1895 for the territory which later became Northern Rhodesia, then Zambia.<ref>"[http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V2N4/V2N4.htm First Records-№ 6. The Name Rhodesia]", The ''Northern Rhodesia Journal'', Vol II, No. 4 (1954) pp101–102.</ref><ref>Gray, J.A. "[http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V3N1/V3N1.htm A Country in Search of a Name]", The ''Northern Rhodesia Journal'', Vol III, No. 1 (1956) pp75–78. </ref>

Rhodes decreed in his will that he was to be buried in Matobo Hills, so when he died in the Cape in 1902 his body came up by train to Bulawayo. His burial was attended by Ndebele chiefs, who asked that the firing party should not discharge their rifles as this would disturb the spirits. Then, for the first and probably the only time, they gave the white man the Matabele royal salute "Bayete". Rhodes is buried alongside both Leander Starr Jameson and the 34 white soldiers killed in the Shangani Patrol.

== Political views ==
thumb|Cecil Rhodes
Rhodes wanted to expand the British Empire because he believed that the Anglo-Saxon race was destined to greatness. In his last will and testament, Rhodes said of the British, "I contend that we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race."  He wanted to make the British Empire a superpower in which all of the white countries in the empire, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Cape Colony, would be represented in the British Parliament. Rhodes included Americans in the Rhodes scholarships and said that he wanted to breed an American elite of philosopher-kings who would have the USA rejoin the British Empire. Rhodes also respected the Germans and admired the Kaiser, and allowed Germans to be included in the Rhodes scholarships. He believed that eventually Great Britain, the USA and Germany together would dominate the world and ensure peace together.<ref name=flint/>

On domestic politics within the United Kingdom, Rhodes was a supporter of the Liberal party.<ref name=flint/> Rhodes' only major impact on domestic politics within the United Kingdom was his support of the Irish nationalist party, led by Charles Stewart Parnell (1846–1891). He contributed a great deal of money to the Irish nationalists,<ref name=thomas/><ref name=flint/> although Rhodes made his support for the Irish nationalists conditional upon an autonomous Ireland still being represented in the British Parliament.<ref name=flint/> Rhodes was such a strong supporter of Parnell that even after the Liberals and the Irish nationalists had disowned Parnell because of his adultery with the wife of another Irish nationalist, Rhodes continued to support him.<ref name=thomas/>

Rhodes was much more tolerant of the Dutch-speaking whites in the Cape Colony than were the other English-speaking whites in the Cape Colony. He supported teaching Dutch as well as English in public schools in Cape Colony and even lent money to support this cause. Also, while Prime Minister of Cape Colony, he helped to remove most of the legal disabilities that English-speaking whites had imposed on Dutch-speaking whites.<ref name=flint/> He was a friend of Jan Hofmeyr, leader of the Afrikaner Bond, and became Prime Minister of Cape Colony largely because of Afrikaner support.<ref name=thomas/><ref name=flint/> Rhodes advocated greater self-government for his country, the Cape Colony, in line with his  preference for the empire to be controlled by local settlers and politicians rather than by London (see "Rhodes and the imperial factor" above).

Confusingly for the modern reader, self government of the type Rhodes supported was known as "colonialism". The opposed policy, direct control of a colony from London, was known as "imperialism". This should be kept in mind when reading documents from this time.

==Personal relationships==
===Sexuality===
Rhodes never married, pleading that "I have too much work on my hands" and saying that he would not be a dutiful husband. However, several writers have suggested that there are convincing reasons to believe Rhodes may have been homosexual, although admittedly the amount of direct evidence is scarce. In particular, in discussing this issue the scholar Richard Brown observed: "there is still the simpler but major problem of the extraordinarily thin evidence on which the conclusions about Rhodes are reached. Rhodes himself left few details... Indeed, Rhodes is a singularly difficult subject... since there exists little intimate material - no diaries and few personal letters."<ref name=RBrown>Brown, Richard, Review: The Colossus. The Journal of African History, Vol.31 No.3 (1990) pp.499-502.</ref>

Brown also comments: "On the issue of Rhodes' sexuality... there is, once again, simply not enough reliable evidence to reach firm, irrefutable conclusions. It is inferred, fairly convincingly (but not proved), that Rhodes was homosexual and it is assumed (but not proved) that his relationships with men were sometimes physical. Neville Pickering is described as Rhodes' lover in spite of the absence of decisive evidence."<ref name=RBrown/>

According to a biography by A. Thomas,<ref>A. Thomas, ''Rhodes,'' London, 1996.</ref> the "greatest love of Rhodes' life" was Pickering, also the son of a clergyman, who had moved to South Africa with his family. Rhodes and Pickering lived together in a cottage in what one government official referred to as an "absolutely lover-like friendship".<ref>W. Plomer, ''Cecil Rhodes'', London, 1933.</ref> Rhodes’ devotion was evident when he rushed back from important negotiations for Pickering's twenty-fifth birthday in 1882; on that occasion, Rhodes drew up a new will leaving his entire estate to Pickering. Two years later, Pickering suffered a riding accident. Rhodes nursed him faithfully for six weeks, refusing even to answer telegrams concerning his business interests, yet Pickering died in Rhodes' arms; at his funeral, Rhodes wept hysterically.<ref>W. Plomer, ''Cecil Rhodes'', London, 1933.</ref>

===Princess Radziwill===
In the last years of his life, Rhodes was stalked by a Polish princess named Catherine Radziwill (1858–1941), born Rzewuska, married into a noble Polish-Lithuanian dynasty called Radziwiłł. Radziwill falsely claimed to people that she was engaged to Rhodes, or that they were having an affair. She asked him to marry her, but Rhodes refused. She eventually got revenge by falsely accusing him of loan fraud. He had to go to trial and testify against her accusation. He died shortly after the trial in 1902. She wrote a biography of Rhodes called ''Cecil Rhodes: Man and Empire Maker''. Her accusations were eventually proven false.<ref name=thomas/><ref name=roberts>{{cite book

==During the Boer War==
During the Boer War Rhodes went to Kimberley to help during the siege, but he was more of a liability than an asset. The British military found him intolerable. In particular, Lieutenant Colonel Kekewich disliked Rhodes because of Rhodes' inability to cooperate with the military. Rhodes kept demanding that the military adopt his plans and ideas instead of just doing as they said.<ref name=thomas/> (source Pakenham, Thomas ''The Boer War'')

Although Rhodes remained a leading figure in the politics of southern Africa, especially during the Second Boer War, he was dogged by ill health throughout his relatively short life. Rhodes died in 1902, and was considered at the time one of the wealthiest men in the world.
