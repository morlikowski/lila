Britanicul '''Mark I''' a fost primul tanc de luptă, apare în mitralierelor şi tranşeelor pe câmpurile de luptă. Împreună cu variantele posterioare este tipul de tanc cel mai reuşit din primul razboi mondial.

Mark I era un vehicul romboidal cu un centru de greutate jos şi foarte lung, care putea înainta pe un teren noroios şi să traverseze tranşee. Avea două mitraliere detaşabile şi două puşti pentru faţă şi spate.

În interior echipa împărţea spaţiul disponibil cu motorul care emana monoxid de carbon, vapori de combustibil şi de ulei, camera avea o ventilaţie insuficientă. Temperatura în interior putea atinge 50 ° C. Au existat cazuri cand toata echipa a pierdut conştiinţa sau aveau crize violente cand respiru din nou aer curat.

The British '''Mark I''' was the world's first combat Western Front. Along with its subsequent variants, it was the most successful heavy tank of the war.

==Development==

The Mark I was a development of ''Walter Wilson and William Tritton in the summer of 1915. Working on problems discovered with Willie, the Mark I was designed by Wilson. A gun turret above the hull would have made the centre of gravity too high, so the guns were put in sponsons. The prototype Mark I, ready in December 1915, was called "Mother". One hundred fifty were built. See history of the tank for a more complete story.

==Description==

The Mark I was a naval 6-pounder guns. There were two Hotchkiss machine guns in the sponsons and two removable guns for the front and back.

The hull was undivided internally; the crew shared the same space as the engine. The environment inside was extremely unpleasant; the atmosphere was contaminated with poisonous carbon monoxide, fuel and oil vapours from the engine and cordite fumes from the weapons as ventilation was inadequate. Temperatures inside could reach 50 °C (122 °F). Entire crews lost consciousness or became violently sick when again exposed to fresh air.

To counter the fumes inside and the danger of bullet splash or fragments and rivets knocked off the inside of the hull, the crew wore helmets with goggles and chainmail masks. Gas masks were standard issue as well, as they were to all soldiers at this point in the war (see Chemical warfare).  The side armour of 8 mm initially made them largely immune to small arms fire, but could be penetrated by the recently developed armour-piercing K bullets.  There was also the danger of being overrun by infantry and attacked with grenades. The next generation had thicker armour, making them nearly immune to the K bullets. In response, the Germans developed a larger purpose-made anti-tank rifle, and also a ''Geballte Ladung'' ("Bunched Charge")—several regular stick grenades bundled together for a much bigger explosion.

A direct hit on the roof by an artillery or mortar shell could cause the fuel tanks (which were placed high in the front horns of the track frames either side of the drivers' area, to allow gravity feed) to burst open. Incinerated crews were removed by the special Salvage Companies, also salvaging damaged tanks, that were forbidden to speak about this aspect of their work with the still living tank crews.<ref>David Fletcher, 2001, ''The British Tanks 1915–19'', p. 124.</ref> 

Steering was difficult; controlled by varying the speed of the two tracks. Four of the crew, two drivers (one of which also acted as commander; he operated the brakes, the other the primary gearbox) and two "gearsmen" (one for the secondary gears of each track) were needed to control direction and speed — the latter never more than a walking pace. As the noise inside was deafening, the driver, after setting the primary gear box, communicated with the gearsmen with hand signals, first getting their attention by hitting the engine block with a heavy spanner. For slight turns, the driver could use the steering tail: an enormous contraption dragged behind the tank consisting of two large wheels, each of which could be blocked by pulling a steel cable causing the whole vehicle to slide in the same direction. If the engine stalled, the gearsmen would use the starting handle—a large crank between the engine and the gearbox. Many of these vehicles broke down in the heat of battle making them an easy target for German gunners. There was no wireless (strong drink as a reward.

Later marks carried semaphore arms for signalling.

==Variants and developments==
A requirement was found for two types of armament, so Mark Is were armed either with 6 pounder guns and four machine guns and called "Male" (75) or two Vickers machine guns instead of the 6 pounders and called "Female" (75).

To aid steering, a pair of large wheels were added behind the tank. These were not as effective as hoped and were subsequently dropped.

The subsequent Mark II, III, IV and V and later tanks all bear a strong resemblance to their "Mother".

===Mark I===

**Male: 28 tons (28.4 tonne) 
**Female: 27 tons (27.4 tonne)

The Gun Carrier Mark I was largely produced with parts identical to those used to build the Mark I.

===Mark II===

Unhardened armour. Built from December 1916 to January 1917 for training only, but used in the Battle of Arras in April 1917 because of delays in the production of the Mark I tank.

===Mark III===

The Mark III was a training tank, which used Lewis machine guns and a smaller sponson for the females. Fifty were built. It was originally intended that the Mark III have all the proposed new design features of the Mark IV. This is why there were two distinct training types, the Mark II being little more than a slightly improved Mark I. Development of the new features was so slow however, that the change from the Mark II was very gradual only. The last two Mark III's were melted down in World War II.

===Mark IV===
An up-armoured version of the Mark I with all fuel stored in a single external tank (located between the rear track horns) in an attempt to improve crew safety. The sponsons could be pushed in to reduce the width of the tank for rail transportation. Rails on the roof carried an unditching beam. A  total of 1,220 were built: 420 Males, 595 Females and 205 Tank Tenders, which were supply tanks.

The director of the Tank Supply Department, Albert Gerald Stern, first intended to fit the Mark IV with a new engine and transmission. Production of battle tanks was halted until the new design was ready, necessitating the Mark II and III as interim training tanks. He failed however to complete development soon enough to start production in time to have 200 tanks ready for the promised date of 1 April 1917. He was ultimately forced to take a Mark IV in production in May 1917 that was only slightly different from the Mark I.

The Mark IV Male carried four QF 6 pdr 6 cwt with shorter barrels). The Female had six machine guns. Two of the machine guns were operated by the gun loaders.

===Mark V series===
====Mark V====

The Mark V was first to be a completely new design. When however in December 1917 the desired new engine and transmission became  available, this design was abandoned and the designation switched to an improved version of the Mark IV, in fact a Mark IV as it was originally intended: more power (150 bhp) with a new Ricardo engine, improved steering mechanism and epicyclical transmission, only one driver was needed. Cabin for machine-gunner on the roof. Four hundred were built, 200 each of Males and Females. Several were converted to ''Hermaphrodites'' by swapping sponsons to give a single 6 pounder gun for each. These are also sometimes known as "Mark V Composite".

====Mark V*====
thumb|right|''A British Mark V* tank''—on the roof the tank carries an ''unditching beam'' on rails, that could be attached to the tracks and used to extricate itself from difficult muddy trenches and shell craters

Sir William Tritton in 1917 developed the Tadpole Tail: an extension of the tracks to be fitted to the back of a tank to improve trench crossing abilities. This was necessary because the Hindenburg Line had 3.5 metre wide trenches to stop the British tanks. When Major Philip Johnson of Central Tank Corps Workshops heard of this project, he immediately understood that the weight of the heavy girders strengthening the attachment might be put to a better use by creating a larger tank. He cut a Mark IV in half and stretched the hull, lengthening it by six feet. When details had been forgotten it has for a long time been assumed that most Mark V* had been field conversions made by Johnson. We now know that they were all factory-built. It had a larger "turret" on the roof and doors in the side of the hull. The weight was 33 tons. 645 were built out of an order for 500 Males and 200 Females.

The extra section was also designed to house a squad of infantry. This was the first ever purpose designed tracked armoured personnel carrier (APC), it was also the first APC to be significantly armed, as some earlier conversions of tanks into supply carriers lacked any armament. It could operate as a tank as well as carrying troops, and it was not until the post World War II era Merkava that a tank that could also carry troops under protection was produced.

''Note: the asterisk (*) in early British tank designations was usually pronounced as "star" when spoken, e.g., Mark Five-star, or Mark Five-star-star, etc.''

====Mark V**====
thumb|right|''A British Mark V** tank''

Because the Mark V* had been lengthened, its original length-width ratio had been spoiled. Lateral forces in a turn now became unacceptably high causing thrown tracks and an enormous turn circle. Therefore Major Wilson redesigned the track in May 1918, with a stronger curve reducing ground contact (but increasing ground pressure as a trade-off). An uprated 225 hp Ricardo engine was fitted. The cabin for the driver was combined with the roof cabin; there now was a separate machine gun position in the back. 197 were built out of an order for 750 Males and 150 Females.
