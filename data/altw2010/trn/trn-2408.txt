:''"Jing Wu Men" redirects here. For the real martial arts school, see Chin Woo Athletic Association.''

'''''Fist of Fury''''' (; formerly known as ''The Chinese Connection'' in the 1972. It starred the martial artist Bruce Lee in his second major film after ''The Big Boss''.  The film depicts a Chinese martial arts school in Shanghai International Settlement which fought against a Japanese judo school.

==Background==
The film is loosely based on ''Chinese title. The plot features the story of Chen Zhen (陳真; Cantonese:  Chen Jen, played by Bruce Lee), a fictional character created by director Lo Wei for the film.<ref>http://www.steelsamurai.co.uk/flicks/reviews/legendofafighter/legend_of_a_fighter.html this URL is not accessible</ref> Chen Zhen is shown as a student of the real-life martial artist Hongkou Dojo of Suzuki Taro.

The film is set in the early 20th century after the death of Huo Yuanjia, and during the occupation of Shanghai, China by several foreign countries, including Japan. It is about a Chinese Martial Arts school whose master (Huo) was recently killed by men associated with a rival Japanese Martial Arts School who continue to harass them. Chen is out to find out who is responsible for his master's death and get justice.

The real Jing Wu school still survives to this day and can be found in many major cities abroad. Their headquarters are in Malaysia, and their students strive to keep the Jing Wu spirit to this day.

The film is famous for the scene in which Chen Zhen is denied entry into a park bearing a sign stating "No Dogs and Chinese Allowed" (Traditional Chinese:  「狗與華人不得入內」). After the turban wearing Sikh guard at the park allows a foreigner's dog to enter the park, a man out of a group of Japanese approaches Chen and tells him that if he pretends to be a dog then he will take him inside. Chen becomes furious and proceeds to attack the Japanese with punches and kicks. He then kicks the offending sign in the air and breaks it with a flying kick.

The former U.S. title ''The Chinese Connection'', trading off the popularity of the recently-released The French Connection'', was originally intended for Bruce Lee's previous film, ''The Big Boss'', due to the drugs theme of that movie. However, the U.S. titles for the films were accidentally swapped for an unknown reason so this film carried the title ''The Chinese Connection'' until 2005, despite being obviously unrelated to the content of the movie. ''The Big Boss'' in the U.S. had the title ''Fist'''''s''''' of Fury'', leading to much confusion. Recent American TV showings and the current official US DVD release from Twentieth Century-Fox have restored the original titles of all the renamed Bruce Lee films; this film is now officially called ''Fist of Fury'' in the United States.

This film is one of Bruce Lee's most influential works, as it is one of the main reasons behind the shift in Hong Kong cinema from swordplay to empty-handed fighting, which initiated the "''Golden era of Kung Fu Cinema''" of the 1970s.

== Cast ==
* Bruce Lee as Chen Zhen ()

* stuntman for the Japanese villain, "Mr. Suzuki", in the final scenes of ''Fist of Fury''. He can be seen flying through the air after Bruce's character delivers a flying kick. Jackie fell much farther than originally intended, at a height of 15 feet. After it had been caught on film, Bruce rushed over to see if he was okay.
*One of the Japanese men during the park entrance scene is played by Yuen Wah, who later appeared in many other Hong Kong action films and in Stephen Chow's ''Kung Fu Hustle''.  He was also Bruce Lee's acrobatics double.

==Box office==
Bruce Lee's ''Fist of Fury'' managed to gross HK$4,358,928.

== Memorable lines ==
* "Now you listen to me, and I will only say it once...We are not sick men!" (after defeating the Japanese karate school for the first time; a reference to China being called the Sick man of Asia).
* "This time you're eating paper. The next time it's gonna be glass!" (after saying the "Sick men of Asia" line).
* "So why did you kill my teacher then?! WHY DID YOU KILL MY TEACHER?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?!...Why did you kill my teacher?!" (after capturing one of the men responsible for his teacher's death. He repeatedly pounds him in his belly with each "why", and was originally going to interrogate him before he ruptured his stomach, killing him in his fit of rage).
* "I have come here to avenge my teacher.  This doesn't concern you.  I'll allow you to leave.  Out.  Out.  Out.  Out.  SCRAM!!!!!" (after entering the school in the final scenes.)
* "I am not educated much, do not lie to me..." (negotiating with the Chinese police officer before being arrested)
* "He was well, there was nothing wrong!  How can a healthy man die?"  
* "Know this!  I shall repay for the lives that I took.  You just leave this School alone!"  (Bruce's last line in the film)

== Historical errors ==

*In the original, Japanese martial artists are shown wearing their hakama (skirts) backwards. This is not the only Chinese martial arts movie of the time to make this mistake. Jet Li's ''Fist of Legend'' displays a better command of Japanese martial arts (and a more favorable and nuanced view of Japanese), perhaps a reflection of better relations between Hong Kong and Japan in more recent years.

==Handling==
Historien foregår i Shanghai i 1908, en smeltedigel som holder på å koke over av rasisme og hat, der kineserne hånes og fornedres av de regjerende Japanerne. Hit vender Chen (Bruce Lee) tilbake for å delta i begravelsen av sin elskede læremester fra den mest berømte Kung Fu-skolen, som døde under mystiske omstendigheter. Chens hevnaksjoner fører etterhvert til stridigheter mellom de to skolene, og til slutt setter Chen i gang en enmannskrig mot den japanske gjengen som drepte hans læremester og terroriserer skolen hans.

'''Tagline''': Bruce Lee hevner seg i døden og hinsides!
