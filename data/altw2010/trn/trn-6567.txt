Sebuah '''tambak udang''' adalah sebuah bisnis "aquaculture" dirancang untuk meningkatkan dan memproduksi udang laut atau prawn untuk konsumsi manusia. Pertambakan udang komersial dimulai pada 1970-an, dan produksi tumbuh dengan cepat, terutama untuk memenuhi pertumbuhan permintaan Amerika Serikat, Jepang, dan Eropa barat. Produksi global total dari udang tambak mencapai lebih dari 1,6 juta ton pada 2003, mewakili hampir 9 milyar dolar AS. Sekitar 75% udang tambak diproduksi di Asia, terutama di China dan Thailand. 25% sisanya diproduksi di Amerika Latin, di mana Brazil merupakan produsen terbesarnya. Negara pengekspor terbesar adalah Thailand.

Pertambakan udang telah berubah dari bisnis tradisional, skala-kecil di famili Penaeidae) dan hanya dua spesies udang -- Pacific White Shrimp dan Giant Tiger Prawn; hampir mencakup 80% dari seluruh udang yang dikembangkan. Industri monokultur ini sangat mudah terserang penyakit, yang menyebabkan beberapa pemusnahan dari populasi pertambakan udang. Peningkatan masalah ekologi, terjadinya penyebaran penyakit berkali-kali, dan tekanan dan kritikan dari NGO dan negara konsumen mengubah industri ini pada akhir 1990-an dan biasanya pengaturan yang lebih ketat dari pemerintah. Pada 1999, sebuah program yang ditujukan pada pengembangan dan promosi praktek pertambakan yang lebih terjamin dilaksanakan, termasuk badan pemerintah, wakil industri, dan organsiasi lingkungan.

A '''shrimp farm''' is an U.S., Lupo 07:10, 17 October 2005 (UTC) --> U.S. dollars. About 75% of farmed shrimp is produced in China and Thailand. The other 25% is produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil is the largest producer. The largest exporting nation is Thailand. 

Shrimp farming has changed from traditional, small-scale businesses in family ''Penaeus vannamei'' (Pacific white shrimp) and the ''ecological problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both NGOs and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulation by governments. In 1999, a program aimed at developing and promoting more sustainable farming practices was initiated, including governmental bodies, industry representatives, and environmental organizations.

== History and geography ==
Shrimp have been farmed for centuries in Asia, using traditional low-density methods. paddies for shrimp cultures during the dry season, when no rice could be grown.<ref name="Roen01">Rönnbäck,&nbsp;2001.</ref> Such traditional cultures often were small operations in coastal areas or on river banks. Mangrove areas were favoured because of their naturally abundant supply of shrimp.<ref name = "LPCM03"/> Wild juvenile shrimp were trapped in ponds and reared on naturally occurring organisms in the water until they had the desired size and then were harvested.

The origins of industrial shrimp farming can be traced back to the 1930s, when Kuruma shrimp (''Penaeus japonicus'') was spawned and cultivated for the first time in Japan. By the 1960s, a small shrimp farming industry had appeared in Japan.<ref name="Ros04a">Rosenberry, ''About Shrimp Farming''.</ref> Commercial shrimp farming began in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Technological advances led to ever more intensive forms of shrimp farming, and the growing market demand led to a proliferation of shrimp farms throughout the world, concentrated in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The growing consumer demand coincided in the early 1980s with faltering wild shrimp catches, creating a veritable boom in shrimp aquaculture. Taiwan was amongst the early adopters and a major producer in the 1980s; its production collapsed beginning in 1988 due to poor management practices and disease.<ref name="ISA00">International Shrimp Action Network, 2000.</ref> In Thailand, large-scale intensive shrimp farming expanded rapidly from 1985.<ref name="HL01">Hossain & Lin, 2001.</ref> In South America, shrimp farming was pioneered by Ecuador, where it expanded dramatically from 1978.<ref name="McC04">McClennan, 2004.</ref> Brazil had been active in shrimp farming since 1974, but the trade really boomed there only in the 1990s, making the country a major producer within a few years.<ref name="Nov03">Novelli, 2003.</ref> Today, there are marine shrimp farms in over fifty countries.

== Farming methods ==
When shrimp farming emerged in the 1970s as an economically viable alternative to satisfy growing market demands that had surpassed the capacity of the wild shrimp fishery, the km²) were used in some places. The initially largely unregulated business boomed, and in many regions whole coastlines were transformed and huge areas of mangroves cleared. Further technological advances made more intensive farming practices possible that could achieve higher yields per area while using less land. Semi-intensive and intensive farms appeared, where the shrimp were reared on artificial feeds and ponds were actively managed. Although there are still many extensive farms, new farms typically are of the (semi-)intensive kind.

Until the mid-1980s, most shrimp farms were stocked with young wild shrimp, called ''postlarvae'', typically caught by local fishermen. Postlarvae fishing became an important economic sector in many countries. To counteract the beginning depletion of fishing grounds and to ensure a steady supply of young shrimp to farms, the industry started raising shrimp from the egg and maintaining adult shrimp for reproductive purposes in specialized installations called hatcheries. 

=== Life cycle of shrimp ===
right|thumb|120px|A [[nauplius (larva)|nauplius of a shrimp.]]
Shrimp mature and breed only in a marine habitat. The females lay 50,000 to 1 million eggs, which hatch after some 24 hours into tiny nauplii. These nauplii feed on metamorphosis into myses. The myses already look akin to tiny shrimp and feed on algae and estuaries, which are rich in nutrients and low in salinity. There they grow and eventually migrate back into open waters when they mature. Adult shrimp are benthic animals living primarily on the sea bottom.<ref name="IAA01a">Indian Aquaculture Authority, ''Environment Report'', ch.&nbsp;2.</ref>

=== Technologies ===
In shrimp farming, this lifecycle occurs under controlled conditions. The reasons to do so include more intensive farming, improved size control resulting in more uniformly sized shrimp, and better predator control, but also the ability to speed up the cycle by controlling the climate (especially in farms in the temperate zones, using greenhouses). There are three different stages:
*''Hatcheries'' breed shrimp and produce nauplii or even postlarvae, which they sell to farms. Large shrimp farms maintain their own hatcheries and sell nauplii or postlarvae to smaller farms in the region.
*''Nurseries'' are those parts of a shrimp farm where postlarvae are grown and accustomed to the marine conditions in the growout ponds.
*In the ''growout'' ponds the shrimp are grown from juveniles to marketable size, which takes between three to six months.

Most farms produce one to two harvests a year; in tropical climates, a farm may even produce three. Because of the need for salt water, shrimp farms are located on or near a coast. Inland shrimp farms have also been tried in some regions, but the need to ship salt water and competition for land with agricultural users led to problems. Thailand banned inland shrimp farms in 1999.<ref name="AGL00">FAO, ''Impacts of salt-affected soils''.</ref>

=== Hatcheries ===
right|thumb|250px|Tanks in a shrimp hatchery.
Small-scale hatcheries are very common throughout Southeast Asia. Often run as family businesses and using a low-technology approach, they use small tanks (less than ten tons) and often low animal densities. They are susceptible to disease, but due to their small size, they can typically restart production quickly after disinfection. The survival rate is anywhere between zero and 90%, depending on a wide range of factors, including disease, the weather, and the experience of the operator.

''Greenwater'' hatcheries are medium-sized hatcheries using large tanks with low animal densities. To feed the shrimp larvae, an algal bloom is induced in the tanks. The survival rate is about 40%.

''Galveston'' hatcheries (named after Galveston, Texas, where they were developed) are large-scale, industrial hatcheries using a closed and tightly controlled environment. They breed the shrimp at high densities in large (15 to 30 ton) tanks. Survival rates vary between zero and 80%, but typically achieve 50%. 

In hatcheries, the developing shrimp are fed on a diet of algae and later also freeze-dried animal protein, for example krill. Nutrition and medication (such as antibiotics) fed to the brine shrimp nauplii are passed on to the shrimp that eat them.<ref name="Ros04a"/>

=== Nurseries ===
right|thumb|250px|Farmers transferring postlarvae from the tanks on the truck to a growout pond.
Many farms have nurseries where the postlarval shrimp are grown into juveniles for another three weeks in separate ponds, tanks, or so-called raceways. A raceway is a rectangular, long, shallow tank through which water flows continuously.<ref name="vW99a">van Wyk ''et al.'', [http://www.hboi.edu/aqua/downloads/pdf/shrimpmanual_chapter4.pdf ''HBOI Manual'', ch.&nbsp;4].</ref>

In a typical nursery, there are 150 to 200 animals per square metre. They are fed on a high-protein diet for at most about three weeks before they are moved to the growout ponds. At that time, they weigh between one and two grams. The water salinity is adjusted gradually to that of the growout ponds.

Farmers refer to postlarvae as "PLs", with the number of days suffixed (i.e., PL-1, PL-2, etc.). They are ready to be transferred to the growout ponds after their gills have branched, which occurs around PL-13 to PL-17 (about 25 days after hatching). Nursing is not absolutely necessary, but is favored by many farms because it makes for better food utilization, improves the size uniformity, helps utilize the infrastructure better, and can be done in a controlled environment to increase the harvest. The main disadvantage of nurseries is that some of the postlarval shrimp die upon the transfer to the growout pond.<ref name="Ros04a"/>

Some farms do not use a nursery but stock the postlarvae directly in the growout ponds after having acclimated them to the appropriate temperature and salinity levels in an acclimation tank. Over the course of a few days, the water in these tanks is changed gradually to match that of the growout ponds. The animal density should not exceed 500/liter for young postlarvae and 50/liter for larger ones, such as PL-15.<ref name="vW99b">van Wyk ''et al.'', [http://www.hboi.edu/aqua/downloads/pdf/shrimpmanual_chapter6.pdf ''HBOI Manual'', ch.&nbsp;6.]</ref>

=== Growout ===
right|thumb|Shrimp pond with paddlewheel aerators in Indonesia. The pond is in an early stage of cultivation; plankton has been seeded and grown (whence the greenish color of the water); shrimp fry is to be released next.
In the growout phase, the shrimp are grown to maturity. The postlarvae are transferred to ponds where they are fed until they reach marketable size, which takes about another three to six months. Harvesting the shrimp is done by fishing them from the ponds using nets or by draining the ponds. Pond sizes and the level of technical infrastructure vary.

Extensive shrimp farms using traditional low-density methods are invariably located on a coast and often in mangrove areas. The ponds range from just a few to more than 100 hectares; shrimp are stocked at low densities (2–3 animals per square metre, or 25,000/ha). The tides provide for some water exchange, and the shrimp feed on naturally occurring organisms. In some areas, farmers even grow wild shrimp by just opening the gates and impounding wild larvae. Prevalent in poorer or less developed countries where land prices are low, extensive farms produce annual yields from 50 to 500 kg/ha of shrimp (head-on weight). They have low production costs (US$1–3/kg live shrimp), are not very labor intensive, and do not require advanced technical skills.<ref name="Tac02">Tacon, 2002.</ref>

right|thumb|A one-[[horsepower paddlewheel aerator. The splashing may increase the evaporation rate of the water and thus increase the salinity of the pond.]] 
Semi-intensive farms do not rely on tides for water exchange but use pumps and a planned pond layout. They can therefore be built above the high tide line. Pond sizes range from 2 to 30&nbsp;ha; the stocking densities range from 10 to 30/m² (100,000–300,000/ha). At such densities, artificial feeding using industrially prepared shrimp feeds and fertilizing the pond to stimulate the growth of naturally occurring organisms become a necessity. Annual yields range from 500 to 5,000 kg/ha, while production costs are in the range of US$2–6/kg live shrimp. With densities above 15 animals per square metre, aeration is often required to prevent oxygen depletion. Productivity varies depending upon water temperature, thus it is common to have larger sized shrimp in some seasons than in others.

Intensive farms use even smaller ponds (0.1–1.5 ha) and even higher stocking densities. The ponds are actively managed: they are aerated, there is a high water exchange to remove waste products and maintain water quality, and the shrimp are fed on specially designed diets, typically in the form of formulated pellets. Such farms produce annual yields between 5,000 and 20,000&nbsp;kg/ha; a few super-intensive farms can produce as much as 100,000&nbsp;kg/ha. They require an advanced technical infrastructure and highly trained professionals for constant monitoring of water quality and other pond conditions; their production costs are in the range of US$4–8/kg live shrimp.

Estimates on the production characteristics of shrimp farms vary. Most studies agree that about 55–60% of all shrimp farms worldwide are extensive farms, another 25–30% are semi-intensive, the rest being intensive farms. Regional variation is high, though, and [Tacon (2002)] reports wide discrepancies in the percentages claimed for individual countries by different studies.<ref name="Tac02"/>

===Feeding the shrimps===

While extensive farms mainly rely on the natural productivity of the ponds, more intensively managed farms rely on artificial shrimp feeds, either exclusively or as a supplement to the organisms that naturally occur in a pond. A food chain is established in the ponds, based on the growth of phytoplankton. Fertilizers and mineral conditioners are used to boost the growth of the phytoplankton to accelerate the growth of the shrimps. Waste from the artificial food pellets and excrements of the shrimps can lead to the eutrophication of the ponds.

Artificial feeds come in the form of specially formulated, granulated pellets that disintegrate quickly. Up to 70% of such pellets are wasted, as they decay before the shrimps have eaten them.<ref name="Ros04a"/> The shrimps are fed two to five times daily; the feeding can be done manually either from ashore or from boats, or using mechanized feeders distributed all over a pond. The feed conversion rate (FCR), i.e. the amount of food needed to produce a unit (e.g. one kilogram) of shrimp, is claimed by the industry to be around 1.2&ndash;2 in modern farms, but this is an optimum value that is not always attained in practice. For a farm to be profitable, a feed conversion rate below 2.5 is necessary; in older farms or under suboptimal pond conditions, the ratio may easily rise to 4:1.<ref name="CDE03_93">Chautard ''et al.'',&nbsp;p.&nbsp;39.</ref> Lower FCRs result in a higher profit for the farm.

== Farmed species ==
Although there are many species of shrimp and prawn, only a few of the larger ones are actually cultivated, all of which belong to the family of family Penaeidae),<ref name="Ros04b">Rosenberry, ''Species of Farm-raised Shrimp''.</ref> and within it to the genus ''Penaeus''. Many species are unsuitable for farming: they are too small to be profitable, or simply stop growing when crowded together, or are too susceptible to diseases. The two species dominating the market are:

*Pacific coast from Mexico to Peru, it grows to a size of 23&nbsp;cm. ''P. vannamei'' accounts for 95% of the production in Latin America. It is easy to breed in captivity, but succumbs to the Taura disease. 
*Giant tiger prawn (''P. monodon'', also known as "black tiger shrimp") occurs in the wild in the Indian Ocean and in the Pacific Ocean from Japan to Australia. The largest of all the cultivated shrimp, it can grow to a length of 36&nbsp;cm and is farmed in Asia. Because of its susceptibility to whitespot disease and the difficulty of breeding it in captivity, it is gradually being replaced by ''L. vannamei'' since 2001.

Together, these two species account for about 80% of the whole farmed shrimp production.<ref name="Jos04">Josueit,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;8.</ref> Other species being bred are:
right|thumb|250px|[[Marsupenaeus japonicus|Kuruma shrimp in an aquaculture observation tank in Taiwan.]]

*Western blue shrimp (''P. stylirostris'') was a popular choice for shrimp farming in the western hemisphere, until the IHHN virus wiped out nearly the whole population in the late 1980s. A few stocks survived and became resistant against this virus. When it was discovered that some of these were also resistant against the Taura virus, some farms again bred ''P. stylirostris'' from 1997 on.
*Chinese white shrimp (''P. chinensis'', also known as the ''fleshy prawn'') occurs along the coast of China and the western coast of C). Once a major factor on the world market, it is today used almost exclusively for the Chinese domestic market after a disease wiped out nearly all the stocks in 1993.
*Kuruma shrimp (''P. japonicus'') is farmed primarily in Japan and US$100 per pound ($220/kg).
*Indian white shrimp (''P. indicus'') is a native of the coasts of the Indian Ocean and is widely bred in India, Iran and the Middle East and along the African shores.
*Banana shrimp (''P. merguiensis'') is another cultured species from the coastal waters of the Indian Ocean, from Oman to Indonesia and Australia. It can be grown at high densities.

Several other species of ''Penaeus'' play only a very minor role in shrimp farming. Some other kinds of shrimp also can be farmed, e.g. the "Akiami paste shrimp" or ''Metapenaeus spp.'' Their total production from aquaculture is of the order of only about 25,000 tonnes per year, small in comparison to that of the penaeids.

== Diseases ==
There are a variety of lethal viral monocultural farms such virus infections spread rapidly and may wipe out whole shrimp populations. A major transfer vector of many of these viruses is the water itself; and thus any virus outbreak also carries the danger of decimating shrimp living in the wild.

Thai, affects ''P. monodon'' throughout Southeast Asia.<ref name="GSMFC03a">Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission: [http://nis.gsmfc.org/nis_factsheet.php?toc_id=119 ''Non-Native Species Summaries: ''Yellowhead Virus'' (YHV)''], 2003. URL last accessed 2005-06-23.</ref> It had been reported first in Thailand in 1990. The disease is highly contagious and leads to mass mortality within 2 to 4 days. The cephalothorax of an infected shrimp turns yellow after a period of unusually high feeding activity ending abruptly, and the then moribund shrimp congregate near the surface of their pond before dying.<ref name="OIE03a">OIE: [http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_00049.htm ''Aquatic Manual'', sect. 4.1.3].</ref>

Whitespot syndrome is a disease caused by a family of related viruses. First reported in 1993 from Japanese ''P. japonicus'' cultures,<ref name="OIE03b">OIE: [http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_00048.htm ''Aquatic Manual'', sect. 4.1.2].</ref> it spread throughout Asia and then to the Americas. It has a wide host range and is highly lethal, leading to mortality rates of 100% within days. Symptoms include white spots on the carapace and a red hepatopancreas. Infected shrimp become lethargic before they die.<ref name="GSMFC03b">Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission: [http://nis.gsmfc.org/nis_factsheet.php?toc_id=7 ''Non-Native Species Summaries: ''White Spot Syndrome Baculovirus Complex'' (WSBV)''], 2003.

Taura syndrome was first reported from shrimp farms on the Taura river in Ecuador in 1992. The host of the virus causing the disease is ''P. vannamei'', one of the two most commonly farmed shrimp. The disease spread rapidly, mainly through the shipping of infected animals and broodstock. Originally confined to farms in the Americas, it has also been propagated to Asian shrimp farms with the introduction of ''P. vannamei'' there. Birds are thought to be a route of infection between farms within one region.<ref name="OIE03c">OIE: [http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_00047.htm ''Aquatic Manual'', sect. 4.1.1].</ref>
