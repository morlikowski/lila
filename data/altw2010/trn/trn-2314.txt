== History ==
=== Formation (1996–2000) ===

Formed in 1996 in Peoria, Illinois, Mudvayne formed after they met at the local YMCA and realized they collectively had similar taste in music. Together the band released the ''Kill, I Oughta'' EP. The EP received local attention, but it would be another three years until they would break into the mainstream. During this period, bassist Shawn Barclay left the band, and was replaced by Ryan Martinie.

=== ''L.D. 50'' and ''The Beginning Of All Things To End'' (2000–2001) ===

The band first hit the mainstream in 2000, when they were featured on the second stage of the Tattoo the Earth Art and Music Festival Tour. They scored their first hit single with the song "Dig" from their debut album ''L.D. 50''. For this song, the band won the first ever MTV2 Award at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2001. The popularity of the song paved the way for the highly successful album (certified gold, sold over 500,000 as of 2001.)and was followed by singles "Death Blooms" and "Nothing to Gein". 

In 2001, they released an extended version of the ''Kill, I Oughtta'' EP titled as ''The Beginning of All Things to End'' and continued their frequent touring.

=== ''The End of All Things to Come'' (2002–2003) ===

During the ''L.D. 50'' era, the band was famous for wearing extravagant make-up, seen in both their music videos and live concerts, and using unusual stage names such as Kud, Gurrg, RyKnow, and sPaG.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/mudvayne/bio.jhtml Mudvayne | Music Artist | Videos, News, Photos & Ringtones | MTV<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> With their second album, 2002's '' Music, Celebrity, Artist News | MTV News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Mudvayne's reason for wearing such extravagant make-up was, according to the band, to add a visual aspect to their music and to set them apart from other run-of-the-mill metal bands.<ref>[http://www.brightonlife.com/news/mudvayne-c2-on-monday-2nd-june-2003-183.html Mudvayne @ C2 On Monday 2nd June 2003 :: Brighton News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Mudvayne participated in the [[Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003, headlined by Metallica, and with the release of the 2003 single "World So Cold", Mudvayne abandoned their use of make-up entirely.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1497672/03022005/mudvayne.jhtml Mudvayne Lose The Makeup, Find Inspiration In Isolation | News | VH1.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

In 2005, their third album ''Lost and Found'' was released with the band members' real names and without any gimmicks. However, the band has said that future use of make-up is not out of the question.<ref>[http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2005/03/2311.cfm Mudvayne Reveal Their True Face<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In mid-2005, Mudvayne played on the main stage of Ozzfest.

=== ''By the People, For the People'' and Fourth studio album (2007–2008) ===

By the People, For the People is a compilation of demo/live versions of previously released songs (chosen by the fans), 2 b-sides, and a few introductions to some songs, and 2 new songs.  The first single from this album "Dull Boy" can be heard on the [http://www.mudvayne.com Mudvayne Official Homepage] and the [http://www.myspace.com/mudvayne Mudvayne MySpace] page.

'''Mudvayne''' est un groupe américain de néo-métal. Leur style, très particulier, se veut structuré et réfléchi. Eux-mêmes décrivent leur musique comme du « math-metal ».

Leur discographie se compose aujourd'hui de quatre opus. Une démo ''Kill I oughta'', un premier album ''L.D 50'' dans lequel le groupe pose en effet les marques de son concept.

Le second album, dans une lignée identique, se veut un peu plus musical et un peu moins brut : ''The end of all thing is to come'' les fait connaître du grand public, avec des chansons à potentiel commercial un peu plus large, comme ''World so cold'', ou encore ''Not falling'', qui est la bande originale du film « Le Vaisseau fantôme » (titre original : ''Ghost Ship'').

Leur troisième opus ''Lost And Found'', sorti récemment, marque définitivement le virage musical entrepris par le groupe.La chanson "forget to remember " qui fut la bande original du film " Saw II " a été le debut de leur renaissance .
