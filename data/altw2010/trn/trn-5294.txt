The '''Glasgow and South Western Railway''' (G&SWR), one of the pre-grouping railway companies, served a triangular area of south-west Scotland, between Glasgow, Stranraer and Carlisle. It assumed its title following an amalgamation in 1850<ref name="Hammerton">Hammerton (1921)</ref> and became a constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at the 1923 grouping of the railways.

==Extent==
The main line ran from Glasgow along the west coast and to Gretna.  The railway also served Paisley, Greenock, Ardrossan, Troon and the ports on the west coast, between which it had regular steamer services. It also owned the harbours at Troon and Ayr. The headquarters were at St Enoch Station, Glasgow. In 1921 the railway comprised 1,128 miles of line and the company’s capital was about £19 million.<ref name="Hammerton"/>

The G&SWR, in association with the Midland Railway, provided a third Anglo-Scottish route, intermediate between the West Coast and East Coast routes. It was as a result of the Midland connection that Glasgow St Enoch station was designed in a style heavily influenced by London St Pancras.

==History==
* The first railway in Scotland authorised by Act of Parliament (27 May 1808), which was to become part of the G&SWR, was the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway, opened in 6 July 1812, built to carry coal; it was not taken over by the G&SWR until July 1899. 
* The main line between Glasgow and Carlisle was opened in stages:
** 12 August 1840 -  Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&AR) opened between Glasgow and Ayr, with a branch to Kilmarnock. The eastern end, the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway, was jointly owned with the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway.<ref name="JohnThomas">John Thomas (1971)</ref>  
** 4 April 1843 - Dalry - Kilmarnock.
**? May 1848 - Irvine - Crosshouse
** 8 August 1848 - Kilmarnock - Muirkirk.
** 9 August 1848 - Kilmarnock - Galston.
** 23 August 1848 - Dumfries - Gretna Junction.
** New Cumnock.
** 28 October 1850 - New Cumnock - Closeburn.

On that latter date the GPK&AR amalgamated with the Bridge Street railway station, and Carlisle.

* Renfrew: in 1847 the  gauge Paisley and Renfrew Railway was bought by the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway and was regauged to standard gauge.

* The ''Firth of Clyde line'', consisting of two lines, the Bridge of Weir Railway and the Greenock and Ayrshire Railway was opened in 1869, to meet demand for connections to Clyde steamers. The G&SWR built their lines, via Kilmacolm, to Greenock (Princes Pier); where they built a large and imposing terminus. Later this quay was extended, providing  a landing-stage nearly 1,400 ft (420 m) long.<ref name=brit11></ref>

==Closures==
St Enoch Station no longer exists, it closed in 1966 and it became a car park; the roof was demolished in 1975. In the mid 1980s, the site was redeveloped as the St Enoch Centre, opening in May 1989.

The Bridge of Weir Railway and the Greenock and Ayrshire Railway to Greenock Princes Pier was closed between Princes Pier and Kilmacolm in 1966. However, in 1971 the Princes Pier stub was connected to the Inverclyde Line, at Cartsburn junction, in order to serve the Clyde Port Authority container terminal. The Paisley Canal Line closed completely in 1983, and the original Paisley Canal station, on the east side of Causeyside Street, became a steak house. In the 1980s / 1990s the course of the line beyond Paisley was made into a footpath and cycle path. This connects Lady Octavia Park in Greenock, through upper Port Glasgow, Kilmacolm, past Quarrier's Village, and on to Paisley. It forms a section of the Sustrans scheduled National Cycle Route from Edinburgh to Gourock.<ref></ref> 

Die '''Glasgow and South Western Railway''' (G&SWR) war eine britische Eisenbahngesellschaft, die von 1850 bis 1922 existierte. Sie erschloss ein dreieckförmiges Gebiet im Südwesten Schottlands, zwischen Glasgow, Stranraer und Carlisle. Im letzten Betriebsjahr betrug die Länge des Streckennetzes 793 km.

== Geschichte ==
Die Hauptstrecke von Glasgow nach Carlisle wurde in mehreren Abschnitten erbaut. Am 12. August 1840 eröffnete die Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&AR) das Teilstück zwischen Glasgow und Ayr, mit einem Abzweig nach Kilmarnock. Das nordöstliche Ende dieser Strecke, die Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway, war im gemeinsamen Besitz mit der Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway.

Ab 1843 folgten nacheinander weitere Abschnitte. Am 28. Oktober 1850 wurde die letzte Lücke zwischen Cummock und Closeburn geschlossen und die GPK&AR fusionierte mit der Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway (GD&CR) zur Glasgow and South Western Railway. Von diesem Tag an war es möglich, in Zusammenarbeit mit der London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Züge auf der gesamten Länge der West Coast Main Line bis nach London anzubieten.

Auf diese erste Fusion folgten 1854 die Ardrossan and Johnstone Railway, 1869 der Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal (1885 in eine Eisenbahnlinie umgewandelt) und die Bridge of Weir Railway, 1872 die Greenock and Ayrshire Railway sowie 1899 die Kilmarnock and Troon Railway (die älteste Eisenbahnlinie Schottlands).

Die G&SWR wuchs nicht nur durch Fusionen, sondern auch durch den Bau zahlreicher neuer Strecken. 1883 übernahm sie den Bahnhof Glasgow St. Enoch und nutzte diesen als neuen Ausgangspunkt ihrer Züge und als Hauptsitz. Zusammen mit der LNWR und der Midland Railway betrieb die G&SWR das Gemeinschaftsunternehmen Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Joint Railway.
