'''Lightning Seeds''' are an alternative pop/rock band, largely the brainchild of writer, singer and English city of Liverpool.

== Pre-Lightning Seeds and establishment of the name ==

Previous to the Lightning Seeds, Broudie was involved with other bands: firstly Care with Paul Simpson. Big in Japan was effectively a supergroup in reverse, including as it did future members of The KLF, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Frankie Goes to Hollywood among others.<ref>Pete Frame - More Rock Family Trees ISBN 0711968799</ref> 

===''Cloudcuckooland''===
After Simpson parted from Broudie citing musical differences he returned to production, producing Cloudcuckooland, which made the UK Top 20. 

The same year, "Joy" and "All I Want" were also released though they failed to reach the top 100. A moderate amount of success was to be had in the United States, however, where Pure reached the U.S. Billboard top 40. Both "Pure" and "All I Want" would also reach the Modern Rock Tracks top 10.

===''Sense''===

In 1991, Broudie returned to song-writing, laying down a number of tracks for a new album. However before its release, Rough Trade, the distributor for Ghetto collapsed leading to the band being sold on to Virgin Records.

''Sense'' featured the song "The Life of Riley", written for his son. The song was a minor hit at the time reaching #28 on the UK singles chart but would later become much more well known after the instrumental version was adopted by the BBC's Match Of The Day programme for use as the theme for the "Goal of the Month" competition. It was this that would later prompt the FA to approach Broudie to produce a song for the England national football team.

''Sense'' would mark Broudie's first Lightning Seeds song-writing collaborations with former Specials singer Terry Hall. In years to come, it would prove a fruitful partnership.  The album's title track "Sense", co written with Hall, would achieve some chart success, reaching #31 in the UK. Despite this, Virgin began to lose interest in the band as a result of poor sales of the album, which stagnated at #53 in the charts. The Lightning Seeds were subsequently dropped from the label.

==Rise to popularity==
Fortunes would change, however, when Epic agreed to sign the band on the condition that Broudie increase production effort on The Lightning Seeds, putting work with other bands on the backburner and embarking on live tours.

===''Jollification''===

By the end of 1993, Broudie was applying the finishing touches to ''Jollification'', The Lightning Seeds' new album, which would see contributions from Terry Hall and Simon Rogers as well as Ian McNabb. However the time had come to assemble band members for a live tour. Chris Sharrock and Paul Hemmings, both ex-La's, former Rain bass guitarist Martyn Campbell and keyboardist Ali Kane were recruited as in August 1994, the new Lightning Seeds touring line up hit the road. 

The tour seemed to benefit sales of the second single to be released from the album, "Change". Reaching #13 in the charts, it gave The Lightning Seeds their second UK top twenty hit. The band would continue in this vein, ''Jollification'' becoming a critical success <ref>http://www.lightning-seeds.co.uk/fs_net/written.htm# Lightning Seeds website - links to reviews</ref> and spawning several hit singles, including "Lucky You," "Marvellous" and "Perfect." Its cover, designed by Mark Farrow, featured the then innovative use of computer graphics to create an enormous strawberry with people's faces as its seeds. The sleeve for "Change" was a strawberry wearing a Groucho Marx nose, glasses and moustache set.

===''Dizzy Heights'' and "Three Lions"===
Now a chart success, The Lightning Seeds could afford to purchase their own recording studio, Eel Pie Studios - a barge on the River Thames - from Pete Townshend of The Who. This was a long way from 1992 when Broudie was recording in his brother's front room after splitting with his girlfriend<ref>[http://www.lightning-seeds.co.uk/biography.htm Lightning Seeds biography]</ref>.

During this period, a number of songs were recorded for the fourth studio album. One of these, "Ready Or Not", was released as a single in anticipation of the forthcoming ''Dizzy Heights''. It scored  the band yet another top twenty hit, scraping in at #20. 

Production of the album was halted however, as in 1996 the Lightning Seeds provided the music and production for the official England anthem for the Euro '96 football tournament. The FA had contacted Broudie asking whether he would like to do the song though he did not initially accept. Later that evening, after seeing an episode of Fantasy Football, Broudie called back and agreed on the condition that comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel write the lyrics. The success of the English national football team at the tournament would ensure that the song, "Three Lions", became the band's first Number 1 in the UK singles chart. The song would become much bigger than anyone involved could have imagined, becoming a constant terrace chant not only in the UK but abroad, including Germany where the single, complete with new video, reached #16 after Euro '96.

When production of ''Dizzy Heights'' resumed, Martyn and Sharrock recorded live bass guitar and drums respectively to complement the melodic loops which had previously been laid down. The resulting 'feel' reflected the live sound which the band had developed through extensive touring <ref>[http://www.lightning-seeds.co.uk/biography.htm Lightning Seeds biography]</ref>.

The Lightning Seeds maintained their popularity, enjoying three more UK Top 20 hits, including a cover version of The Turtles "You Showed Me," which became the act's biggest non-football hit.

===''Like You Do''===

In 1996 and 1997 the band's line-up changed. Egyptology'' album and was subsequently replaced by Mat Priest of Dodgy. Angie Pollock, who had worked with Shakespears Sister and Terry Hall, replaced Ali Kane on keyboards.

'''The Lightning Seeds''' ist eine englische Rockband.

== Bandgeschichte ==
Die Band wurde von Ian Broudie (Sänger, Songschreiber und Gitarrist) und Simon Rogers gegründet. 

In den 1990er Jahren zählten ''The Lightning Seeds'' zu den bekanntesten Britpop-Bands. Nach dem Auftakterfolg der Single ''Pure'' (1989) entstanden zwei weitere erfolgreiche Alben, deren Singles ''Life of Riley'', ''Sense'', ''Lucky You'' oder ''Change'' mit sehr eingängigen Melodien noch heute zum Standard-Repertoire der großen Radiosender gehören.

1996 produzierten ''The Lightning Seeds'' die offizielle Hymne der englischen Mannschaft zur Frank Skinner ein. Der Song wurde schnell zum Nummer-Eins-Hit und zur internationalen Fußballhymne und wurde wesentlich populärer als der offizielle Turniersong "We're in this together" von Spitze der Hitparade. Wer genau hinsieht, kann im Video zur 98er Version ''Robbie Williams'' unter den Fans erkennen.

Ende der 1990er Jahre konzentrierte sich Ian Broudie auf sein Soloprojekt, was zunächst das Ende des Projektes ''The Lightning Seeds'' bedeutete; anlässlich der Fußball-WM 2006 und der damit verbundenen Neuauflage von ''Three Lions (Football's Coming Home)'' vereinte sich die Band wieder; das Best-Of-Album ''The Very Best Of The Lightning Seeds'' erschien in England im Juni 2006, in Deutschland im September 2007.
