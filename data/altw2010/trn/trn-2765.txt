'''Girard''' is a city in Crawford County, PLSS description = T29S,R23E,sec24 and sec13 from the Crawford County. This city is located on a gently undulating prairie at the center of the county. It is regularly laid out, has a public square in the center. Its elevation is 988 feet above the sea. 

== History ==

The town was started in the spring of 1868, in opposition to Crawfordsville.

The Girard Town Company had been organized and a site secured on the surveyed line of the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Gulf Railroad, which now seemed to be a fixed fact, and this gave it a decided advantage over its antagonist.

In the summer of 1868 Girard was laid out, at or near the center of the county by the Girard Town Company. The Girard Town Company was first composed of the following gentlemen: A. Danford, President; Charles Henry Strong, Secretary; Dr. Couch, Dr. B. F. Hepler, E. J. Boering, Levi Hatch, John Lash, D. S. McIntosh and Col. J. Alexander. This company was formed upon the survey of the railroad through this portion of the county and the town located upon the line, it was named by C. H. Strong, after the town Girard, Pennsylvania, which had previously been his home.

===The Early Days===
<ref> [http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/crawford/crawford-co-p2.html#GIRARD_P1 History of the State of Kansas, Published in 1883 by A. T. Andreas of Chicago IL, Written by William G. Cutler] </ref>
The first buildings erected in Girard were by the following parties, in the order given: Col. J. Alexander, a general store; C. H. Strong, a dwelling house, Eclectic Physician and Surgeon, and a drugstore (Girard Press-1869); Chauncey Doyle, a saloon; N. Sinnet, a general store. Some time during this year (1868) the first blacksmith shop-Boyle Blacksmith-was opened on the North side of the square, followed by White Blacksmith on the Northwest corner of the square (Girard Press-1869); the first frame house was built by A. A. Fletcher, and the first hotel was opened early in the year. In December, James Hull erected the first part of a building which was used temporarily as a court house. The first birth in Girard was that of Mary Fletcher, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. A. A. Fletcher; the first marriage, that of A. J. Vickers to Miss Margaret McIntosh, and the first death that of Mrs. Dr. L. F. Crawford in the spring of 1869. Immediately after the death of this lady, Judge McIntosh located the cemetery southwest of the town. The first celebration in Girard occurred on July 4, 1868. It was a Sunday school celebration and a celebration of the nation's natal day, both in one. The Hon. A. Danford and Dr. Couch were the orators of the day. When these festivities took place the town had made considerable progress. The post office was established in Girard early in 1868, C. H. Strong being appointed first Postmaster.

Under a law passed in March, 1871, Girard became a city of the third class, and in the early part of April elected her first city officers. The last meeting of the trustees was held April 5, and the first meeting of the new Council was held on the 7th. The result of the election was that George Ryan had been chosen Mayor, and A. J. Vickers, J. E. Raymond, E. Fanger, H. P. Grund and F. B. Andrus, Councilmen. At the first meeting of the Council, A. M. Cook was elected Clerk.

====Banks and the Press====
Frank Playter started the first bank in Girard in June, 1871. In 1872, he erected for the accommodation of his business a two-story brick building, the first brick building in the town. This bank was closed in July, 1877, and in August re-organized and started again on a new basis as the Merchants; and Farmers' Bank, with Frank Playter as President. Mr. Playter retired from the bank in January, 1878, and, in June, 1879, this bank was succeeded by the Bank of Girard, established by E. R. Moffit. The Bank of Girard was succeeded in 1882 by the Girard Bank, a private institution of which Chapman & Adams are the proprietors. It is in the Playter Building. 

Citizens' Bank. - J. H. Booth started a bank in May, 1878, and, on February 6, 1882, was succeeded by the Citizens' Bank. This is a private institution, and does a general banking business. The company is composed of four members - J. D. Barker, President; J. T. Leonard, Cashier; H. P. Grund, Vice President, and W. H. Brown. The first newspaper published in Girard was the Crawford County Times, April 16, 1869, by Scott & Cole. Only one number was issued, as the object of its issue was accomplished viz.: the bringing of the Osage Mission people to time.(sic) 

The Girard Press was moved by Warner & Wasser from Fort Scott to Girard in November, 1869, the first issue appearing at the latter place on the 11th of the month. The paper took strong ground in favor of the validity of Mr. Joy's title to the neutral lands, and on this account its office and material were set fire to on July 14, 1871, and destroyed. The loss was $4,000. New material was obtained, and the paper, enlarged and improved, re-appeared August 13, and has since been published as a nine-column folio weekly. When Horace Greeley became a candidate for the Presidency, Dr. Warner, the senior editor, supported his candidacy much to the disappointment of the then junior, present senior editor, E. A. Wasser. In consequence of this disagreement of the two proprietors in regard to politics, Dr. Warner sold his interest June 16, 1873, to A. P. Riddle, since which time the Press has been published as a stanch (sic) and able Republican paper by Wasser & Riddle. 

====Mills====
The Girard Mills were built in 1870, and began operations in the spring of 1871. The first building was a two and a half story frame, costing, with the machinery and power, $10,000. The property was owned by Tontz & Hitz. In 1879, Tontz retired from active participation in the management of the business, and in 1882 sold his interest to Hitz. Mr. Hitz thereupon erected a three and a half story brick mill, put in five run of buhrs, and two sets of Gray's patent rollers, thus making it a combined mill, which experience has demonstrated to be best adapted to grinding Kansas wheat. The machinery is propelled by a fifty horse-power engine, and has a capacity of 100 barrels of flour per day. The old building has been converted into an elevator, with a capacity of 6,000 bushels. The entire property is worth $25,000, and is owned by Mr. C. Hitz. 

The Crawford County Mills were built in 1870 by a stock company. In 1875, they were sold to Frank Playter, and in 1876 to B. C. Redlow, who, in 1879, sold them to C. D. Patterson. These mills are two and a half stories high, contain three run of buhrs and one set of rollers, thus being also a combined mill, and the machinery is propelled by a twenty-five horse-power engine. The entire property is worth $10,000. 

The Custom Mills are located west of the northwest corner of the public square, confine themselves principally to grinding grists, and are worth about $5,000.

===Mining===
Crawford County's coal industry of dates back farther than the sinking of the first mine. For years before the first coal shaft was sunk coal was taken from the surface of the earth in this county. Before the Civil war coal was taken from strip and slope workings in the southeastern part of the county. At that time the nearest settlements were Fort Scott and Carthage, Missouri. Teamsters dug the coal from the outcroppings on the surface, and made a livelihood by hauling it across the prairies to Carthage or Fort Scott. One of these early coal drifts was opened up in the ravine east of the present location of the vitrified brick works in Pittsburg. Coal was also stripped from the surface in a crude manner by teamsters along the old military trail which ran along the state line south from Fort Scott through this county. The pioneer settlers who made a sparse living in this section before the war took coal from the outcroppings and traded it at Fort Scott and Carthage for groceries and supplies. When the Civil war broke out a good deal of coal was hauled by teamsters to the fort at Fort Scott for army use. Most of this was obtained from coal banks along Drywood and Bone creeks in the northern edge of the county.

Carbon Creek was the location of the first mining camp of the county. No shafts were sunk at first, but several strip pits were opened, and from the strip pits slopes were run along the veins, and coal operations opened on a small scale. By 1877 perhaps one hundred miners were working along Carbon creek, getting out coal. One of the early strip pits was opened by the firm of Piper & Sawyer, the latter, P. H. Sawyer, still being a resident of Pittsburg. They ran a slope in from their strip pit. Another strip pit was opened up by Tom Fields of Joplin. A Girard man named Anderson also opened a strip pit, and an Irishman named Dugan opened a slope about 1876. P. H. Sawyer was the first to operate a drift.<ref>[http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/crawford/history/1905/101.html HISTORY OF CRAWFORD COUNTY, Chapter IV, pages 101-117, Published 1905, Written by A.J. Georgia]</ref>

In the 1960s many of the mines closed. Today the landscape of southeastern Crawford County is covered with long strip mines now full of water and serving as fishing lakes & unfarmed wildlife habitat. The ruins of abandoned zinc & lead smelters can also be seen. Many of them being Superfund sites polluted with the toxic remains of smelter operations. The economy that was driven by industrialized mining & smelting during the first half of the 20th century has now (2007) largely reverted to an agricultural basis.

The [http://www.girardpubliclibrary.net Girard Public Library] has several record books and other resources pertaining to mining operations in Southeast Kansas. An interesting detail to the Coal Miner Accident and Death Records (covering 1886-1950) is that after the 1930s, only fatal accidents were reported.
