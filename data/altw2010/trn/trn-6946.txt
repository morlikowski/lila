'''''The Sentinel''''' is a Canadian-produced television series that aired on UPN in the United States from 1996 to 1999. It premiered on March 20, 1996, and ran for 65 episodes (three and a half seasons).

==Plot and characters==
Jim Ellison was a U.S. Army Ranger who spent 18 months in the Peruvian jungle after his unit was killed. During this time, he developed hyperactive senses that came online five years later, when he was a detective in Cascade  PD's Major Crimes Department. When he goes to the hospital to see a doctor, he finds instead Blair Sandburg, an anthropologist from Rainier University who tells him that he's a Sentinel. In ancient tribes, Sentinels protected the village. For Jim, Cascade is his village. Blair has been studying Sentinel mythology for years, but he had never before found a person with all five senses enhanced, a true Sentinel. 

Blair helps Jim control his senses and joins Jim as a police observer. To the surprise of many people, this unlikely partnership works and together they fight against crime in the streets of Cascade.

Jim's hyperactive senses mean he can see beyond what others see, even in the dark, and with more detail; hear sounds that are farther than normal range or too low for anybody else; sense what nobody else can with smell, in short becoming a walking forensic lab. But Jim's powers have a drawback: if he concentrates too strongly in one sense, he could "zone out", a kind of catatonic state. Part of Blair's job is preventing the zone outs. 

The only person who knows Jim's secret, apart from Blair, is his captain and friend, Simon Banks, and in the last half season, so does Megan Connor.

==Character history==
===Jim Ellison===
Jim Ellison was born with hyperactive senses. During his childhood, he had a friend, Bud who helped him with said senses. Unfortunately, Bud was murdered at some point, one of many cases of trauma in his childhood. His mother also left, leaving him to live with his extremely wealthy father, William Ellison, and his brother, Steven Ellison. Jim's relationship with both characters is notably strained, and leads to both the repression of his senses and his joining the Army.

While in the army, Jim becomes a captain in the US Army Rangers and joins Covert Ops. His last mission takes him and his team of seven to Peru to stop a drug-smuggling campaign. Unfortunately, his ranking officer was corrupt and set him and his men up for failure. His helicopter crashes, killing his seven men and leaving him wounded. He is taken in by the Chopec, an elusive and secretive tribe in Peru, and learns to control his senses for the tribe's betterment under the tutelage of Incacha, the tribe's shaman. Incacha calls Jim Enqueri, 'Sentinel'. When a satellite photo finds seven tombstones at the helicopter's crash site, instead of just a pile of scrap metal, the US army sends in a team to bring their man home.

When Jim returns to his city, Cascade, his repression skills come to the fore and leave him without any memories of his time in Peru. Nevertheless, his instincts as a Sentinel are still there as he decides to 'serve and protect' his tribe, his city, Cascade. He joins the police force, and is first assigned to Vice, of which we know little. He might also have spent some time in Narcotics. His temper is legendary, until Jack Pendergast takes him under his wing and transfers him to Major Crimes. Jim then marries Carolyn Plummer, another detective on the force. Jack then dies, and Carolyn and Jim divorce.

Shortly afterwards, Jim is sent on a solitary stakeout for a week. When he returns, his senses reemerge, leaving him feeling a bit on the crazy side. He can see, hear, and smell things that no other person could, he can only handle the blandest of foods, and any barely-coarse materials leave him wishing to claw his skin off. He checks himself into a hospital, where he meets Blair under the guise of Doctor McCoy- or Doctor McKay, as he pronounced it.

During the series Jim falls in love with only a handful women but most of them end up dying in his arms. Several of Jim's old friends from the Army and police force also end up dead during the course of the show.

As a Sentinel Jim has several powers:
<br>- all 5 senses are strongly enhanced
<br>- able to communicate with ghosts
<br>- has a spirit animal, a black jaguar
<br>- receives visions which guide him in the choices he makes and sometimes predict the future (Jim had a vision that showed Blair's death before Alex killed him [see below])
<br>- used the power of his animal spirit to bring Blair back from the dead<br>

===Blair Sandburg===
Blair Sandburg is the genius son of Naomi Sandburg, an absolute flower child. In her youth, she was all about free love and the hippie spirit, and has yet to stop. Blair had little to no stability in his youth, always moving from home to home and never settling, but that was also what spawned his love of anthropology, the study of mankind.

When Blair was sixteen, he moved to Cascade, Washington to begin his studies. An anthropology major, his advisor was Eli Stoddard, a major expert in the field. As he quickly moved through his education, he took many trips on grants to various parts of the globe. When he finally decided to get his doctorate, he became a teaching fellow. The topic of his dissertation was the Sentinel. This was brought about by a monograph by Sir Richard Burton (the explorer, not the actor) that described both the sentinels and their roles in their respective tribes, and their partners, acutely named by one villain: guides.

At twenty-six, Blair has an 'office' in the basement at Rainier, an $850 a month, 10,000 sq. ft. warehouse apartment, and an ex-girlfriend that works at Cascade General, where a man who complains about all five of his senses has recently been admitted.
