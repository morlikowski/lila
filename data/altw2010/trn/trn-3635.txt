Somàlia és un dels països més pobres del món. La seva economia va ser molt devastada durant la guerra civil.

sheep, and Jubba and Shebelle River valleys. The modern sector of the agricultural economy consists mainly of banana plantations located in the south, which have used modern irrigation systems and up-to-date farm machinery. 

Economic progress in Somalia is decidedly mixed. As of January 2007, Somalia is still a fragile state with hundreds of thousands of refugees due to massive floods and the latest fighting of the civil war. However Somalia boasts lower rates of extreme poverty and, in some cases, better infrastructure than richer countries in Africa<ref>[http://rru.worldbank.org/Documents/PapersLinks/280-nenova-harford.pdf Anarchy and Invention] published report by the world bank last accessed at August 19 2007</ref>. However with a GDP of $600 per capita the country is still extremely poor.

There are signs of growth in Somalia:

==Economy==
<!-- Deleted image removed: 200px|right|thumb|A Somali shop, 2005 -->
GDP per capita of Somalia grew 37% in the 1960s, dropped to just 6% in the 1970s and recovered to 37% growth in the 1980s. Since the collapse of the state, Somalia has transformed from what Mohamed Siad Barre referred to as "scientific socialism" to a free market economy. Due to the lack of government oversight or statistics, and the recent war, it is difficult to calculate the size or growth of the economy. For 1994, the CIA estimated GDP at $3.3 billion<ref>[http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps35389/1995/wf950219.htm CIA World Factbook: Somalia (1995)]</ref> In 2001, it was estimated to be $4.1 billion.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/151/so.html#Economy CIA World Factbook: Somalia (2003)]</ref> In 2005, the CIA estimated GDP to be $4.809 billion.<ref name="CIA2006">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html CIA World Factbook: Somalia (2006)]</ref> Real growth in 2005 was projected at 2.4%.

The absence of central government authority, as well as profiteering from counterfeiting, rapidly debased Somalia's currency in 2001–2002. By the spring of 2002, the free market rates, such as used in the Bakaara Market, pegged the value of the Somali shilling (SoSh) emitted by the TNG to over 30,000 shillings to the U.S. dollar. In 2003, that rate had leveled off to 20,000 shillings to the dollar.<ref name=2003-2004-COUNTRY-PROFILE-SOMALIA>{{cite news

|url=http://store.eiu.com/product/30000203SO-sample.html
|accessdate=2007-01-17 }}</ref> In April 2006, the value had recovered even further to 13,400, which is still below the rate of 10,100 SoSh to the dollar in January 2000.<ref>[http://www.fews.net/centers/innerSections.aspx?f=so&m=1001894&pageID=monthliesDoc 2.1 million face emergency despite early rains]</ref> This rate is far worse than the official currency exchange rate, which in January 2000, stood at 2,555.42 SoSh to the dollar<ref name=FXHistory>{{cite web

===Agriculture and natural resources===
Agriculture is the most important sector, with livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export earnings<ref name="CIA2006" />. Nomads and semi-nomads, who are dependent upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion of the population. For them a major economic income source is the export of animal skin. After livestock, bananas are the principal export; sugar, sorghum, maize, and fish are products for the domestic market.

A small fishing industry has begun in the north where tuna, shark, and other warm-water fish are caught, although fishing production is seriously affected by poaching, piracy, and the lack of ability to grant concessions because of the absence of a generally recognized government. Aromatic woods &mdash; frankincense and myrrh &mdash; from a small and diminishing forest area also contribute to the country's exports.

Minerals, including uranium, are found throughout the country, but they have not yet been exploited.

===Light industry===

With the help of foreign aid, small industries such as textiles, handicrafts, meat processing, and printing are being established. Investors have returned in recent years; for example, a Coca-Cola bottling plant opened in Mogadishu in 2004.<ref>{{cite news

===Transportation===
Infrastructure such as roads are as numerous as those in neighbouring countries but of much lower quality. A World Bank report states the private sector has found it too hard to build roads due to high transaction costs and the fact that those who pay road fees are not the only ones using the road (see free rider problem), presenting a problem with recuperation of investment. The national road system nominally comprises 22,100 kilometers (13,702 mi.) of roads that include about 2,600 kilometers (1,612 mi.) of all-weather roads, although most roads have received little maintenance for years and have seriously deteriorated. There are no railways in Somalia, internal land based transportation is solely done by truck and bus.

Air transportation is provided by small air charter firms and craft used by drug importers/exporters. A number of airlines operate from Hargeisa. Some private airlines, including Air Somalia and Daallo Airlines, serve several domestic locations as well as Djibouti and the United Arab Emirates. In 1989, before the collapse of the government, the national airline had only one airplane. Now there are approximately fifteen airlines, over sixty aircraft, six international destinations, and more domestic routes.  According to a World Bank report, the "private airline business in Somalia is now thriving with more than five carriers and price wars between the companies."<ref name = "WB2005-03-18">[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/SOMALIAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20398872~menuPK:367671~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:367665,00.html ''Africa Open for Business''], World Bank, March 18, 2005.</ref>

Bosaso currently has the busiest port in all of Somalia; other smaller ports are located at Merca and Brava. Absence of security and lack of maintenance and improvement are major issues at most Somali ports. The European Community and the World Bank jointly financed construction of a deepwater port at Mogadishu. The Soviet Union improved Somalia's deepwater port at Berbera in 1969. Facilities at Berbera were further improved by a U.S. military construction program completed in 1985, but they have become dilapidated. During the 1990s the United States renovated a deepwater port at Kismayo that serves the fertile Juba River basin and is vital to Somalia's banana export industry. 

On January 17, 2007, new port and airport directors were appointed by the TFG.<ref name=TFG-APPOINTS-DIRECTORS-FOR-AIRPORTS>{{cite news

===Telecommunications===

Radiotelephone service is available to both to regional and international locations. The public telecommunications system has been destroyed or dismantled, however it has been rebuilt privately and is superior to what existed before<ref name="stats">[http://www.peterleeson.com/Better_Off_Stateless.pdf Better off Stateless] accessed on September 14 2007</ref>. Somalia is linked to the outside world via ship-to-shore communications (INMARSAT) as well as links to overseas satellite operators by private telecommunications operators in major towns. Wireless/mobile communications has also become an economic force in Somalia. 

Radio broadcasting stations operate at Mogadishu, Hargeisa, and Galkayo, with programs in Somali and some other languages. There are two television broadcast stations in Mogadishu and one in Hargeisa.

Sanctions by the US in 2001 in the wake of the 9/11 attacks due to suspicions of terrorist funding set back Somali Internet development.<ref name=US-SHUTS-DOWN-SOMALIA-INTERNET>{{cite news

===Financial sector===

Remittance services has become a large industry in Somalia. Successful people from the world-wide diaspora who fled because of the war contribute to the economy around $1 billion annually.<ref name=SOMALIA-REMITTANCES-A-LIFELINE-TO-SURVIVAL>{{cite news

===Construction===
<!-- Deleted image removed: 200px|left|thumb|The building of new homes in Mogadishu. -->

Construction is sporadic, and at times heavily subsidized by foreign aid agencies. Projects, such as the UN WFP program to repair the air strip in Bardheere, are resuscitating infrastructure, homes and commercial sites that have laid in ruins for years or decades.<ref name=SOMALIA-UN-WFP-HELPS-THE-CONSTRUCTION-OF-AIRPORT-LANDING-STRIP-IN-GEDO-PROVINCE>{{cite news

===Energy and utilities===

Electricity is furnished by entrepreneurs, who have purchased generators and divided cities into manageable sectors.

Petroleum exploration efforts, at one time under way, have ceased due to insecurity and instability. There are no proven oil reserves, but there are prospects to explore for oil in Puntland. Due to political instability and the protests of the Transitional Federal Government foreign investors are warned to not make deals until stability is restored.<ref name=ABDILLAHI-YUSUFS-TRANSITIONAL-GOVERNMENT-AND-PUNTLAND-OIL-DEALS>{{cite news
