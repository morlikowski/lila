'''ウイグル語'''は、中央アジアで使用されるテュルク諸語のひとつ。

中央アジアで9世紀から16世紀頃にウイグル文字で表記されていた言語である'''古代ウイグル語'''と、中央アジア東部のタリム盆地（現在の中華人民共和国の新疆ウイグル自治区南部）周辺で現在話されている'''新ウイグル語'''（現代ウイグル語）の、事実上''2つの言語''の総称である。古代ウイグル語と新ウイグル語はともにテュルク諸語のひとつであるが、言語学者の分類するところによれば、若干系統を異にしているとみられ、使用される地域の分布も若干異なる。新ウイグル語の話者は、20世紀に至ってウイグル人と呼ばれるようになった民族であり、ふたつのウイグル語の間には断絶があると考えられる。

== 新ウイグル語 ==

新ウイグル語は、テュルク諸語の南東語群（チャガタイ語群）に属す言語で、現代ウズベク語と非常に近しい関係にある。中国領内の話者人口は700万人以上で、さらに旧ソ連のカザフスタン、キルギスタン、ウズベキスタンにそれぞれ数万から数十万居住するウイグル人や、中国からアフガニスタン、パキスタン、トルコなどに移住した数千人のウイグル人によっても話される。

文字は、旧ソ連ではキリル文字が使われ、中国ではアラビア文字を改良し、母音と子音を全て1音素1文字に対応させた文字を用いる。この改良アラビア文字をウイグル文字と呼ぶことがあるが、古代ウイグル語で使われていたウイグル文字とはまったく別種の文字である。

語彙は、アラビア語・ペルシア語・ロシア語などからの借用語が多く、古代ウイグル語と著しく異なる。新疆では中国語からの借用語も含まれる。ヨーロッパではトルコ語からの借用語も含まれる。

'''Uyghur''' (/''<span class="Unicode">/</span>'', or /''<span class="Unicode">/</span>'')<ref>Its name in other languages in which it might be often referred to is as follows: 
*  in Chinese
* '''' (transliteration: '''') in Russian.</ref> is a China. In English, the name of the ethnicity and its language is spelled variously as ''Uyghur'', ''Uighur'', ''Uygur'' and ''Uigur'', with the preferred spelling being ''Uyghur''. Many English speakers pronounce it as "wEEger" () but the pronunciation "ooygOOr" () is closer to native .

==Classification==
The Uyghur language belongs to the Qarluq group of the Turkic language family, which is among the Altaic languages.

==Geographic distribution==
thumb|left|A bilingual sign using Uyghur, [[Chinese language|Chinese and Hanyu Pinyin in Yining.]]
Uyghur is spoken by 10 million (2007)(20 million according to some unofficial sources) in China, mostly in the far western Xinjiang Autonomous Region. Uyghur is also spoken by 300,000 in Kazakhstan, and there are Uyghur-speaking communities in Afghanistan, Albania, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Turkey, United Kingdom, USA, and Uzbekistan.

==History==

Old Uyghur is an ancient form of Turkic used from the 9th to the 13th centuries in East Turkestan/Uyghurstan.

In the later Uyghur language, any element of Old Uyghur was strongly overlaid by the Chagatai and Timurid dynasties. Chagatai was the common literary language of Central Asia between the 13th and 19th centuries, and is also the ancestor of modern Uzbek. Chagatai in turn owed its origin to the Persian. 

Contrary to some official histories, the Idikut states of Hami and Turpan, which would be properly labeled "Uyghur" during the Karakhanid and Mongol Yuan periods, spoke a dialect closer to Yugur than to Qarluk-Karakhanid. However, these oases came under Chagatai and Timurid rule later in the 14th century, and slowly adopted the common language of the Muslim state when their own Buddhist culture eventually died out. 

Whereas colloquial Chagatai Turkic in Uzbekistan came under heavy modification by absorbing a Kazakh superstrate, the local variants in what is today Chagatai Turkic. Chagatayid states, gave rise to a Kashgarlik variety of the language with great currency in inter-oasis trade. However, since the 19th century Jadid Movement in Xinjiang, the Ili variety, one developed rather recently by Uyghur migrants from all oases since as late as 17th century, became the basis for modern standard Uyghur. This owed much to the strategic location of Ili being an entrepot between Xinjiang and Soviet, Uzbek and Afghan Central Asia, to the relative modern outlook of the Ililik intelligentsia, and to the homogeneous nature of the Ililik dialect as combining features from dialects of all Uyghur oases.

==Official status==
The Uyghurs are one of the 56 official nationalities in China, and Uyghur is an official language of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

==Dialects==
The dialects of Uyghur identified by the Mandarin Chinese. Mandarin Chinese is not used widely in southern Xinjiang. About 80 newspapers and magazines are available in Uyghur; five TV channels and ten publishers serve as the Uyghur media.

==Sounds==
phonemic consonant clusters by means of elision and epenthesis. Uyghur is not a tonal language. Like other Turkic languages, Uyghur has vowel harmony.

Furthermore, it distinguishes short and long phonological processes, but orthographies, nor is the difference between front  and back  which plays a phonological role. Of particular note is the Uyghur-specific feature of "| →  (cf. [[Turkish language|Turkish ''alın'') ‘take!’, || →  (cf. Turkish ''atalarımız'') ‘our fathers’ — not *''etilirimiz'' in Uyghur because the second syllable has an underlying , not : ''ata'' ‘father’; cf. || →  (cf. Turkish ''atımız'') ‘our horse’).

Another phonological Uyghur feature, which is rare among Turkic languages, is that the language is “non-rhotic”, similar to many English dialects of Southern England and New England. Syllable-final /r/ is “dropped;” more correctly speaking, it is assimilated to the preceding vowel and lengthens it; e.g., ''Uyghurlar'' [] ‘Uyghurs’. Many speakers occasionally do sound syllable-final /r/, for instance when they enunciate very carefully, such as in recitation or song or when wanting to teach non-Uyghurs “good” Uyghur, and in so doing they often overcompensate by inserting an [r] after a long vowels where there is no phonemic /r/.

==Grammar==
Uyghur has prefixes and reciprocal and causative.

==Vocabulary==
Uyghur vocabulary is basically from Turkic stock; however, like Uzbek, it has taken on a large quantity of loan words from Persian. Many internationalisms entered the Uyghur language from Russian, and there are some more recent loans from Chinese.

==Writing system==

"Old Uyghur" is a name sometimes applied to the Uyghur modification of the Old Uyghur language, especially in Buddhist texts. Forms of it survived till the 18th century for other languages used in Manchu and Mongolian alphabets are descended from it.

The Uyghur language traditionally used a modified Chagatai script or '' Roman script (''Yengi Yeziq'', “new script”) closely resembling the Soviet Roman script, based on Turkish orthography, is used in Turkey and on the internet.
