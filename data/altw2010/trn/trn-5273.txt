==Song information==
The song was produced by Polow da Don, with lyrics by Sean Garrett and Fergie. Fergie describes the song as being "kind of like a punch in the face to let people know I'm coming out... I've been getting way too into myself nowadays and I just wanna have fun with as many men as I can possible."<ref name="MTV">{{cite web

The song was released to radio on leaked onto the internet on ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart during the charting week of August 5, 2006, and made a 79-point jump to #5 the following week, making this the third biggest jump in billboard history. It then climbed to #1 on August 19, 2006, staying there for three weeks before being displaced by Justin Timberlake's "SexyBack". The song was released to the UK two months later, on September 11, 2006. It soon after peaked at #3 on the UK singles chart, becoming Fergie's first UK solo hit.

The bridge featured on the alternative cover of the single is not London Bridge, but the neighbouring Tower Bridge. This is presumably because the actual current London Bridge is of no particular significance, and consequently many Americans confuse the two. This mistake is also made in the ending of the video for the song (British audiences have noted this after her video debuted in the UK.<ref>[http://www.chartsingles.net/news/music-news/2132/ http://www.chartsingles.net/news/music-news/2132/] ''Chartsingles.new'' </ref>) The use of this bridge has been said to be intentional many times by Fergie herself as well as people who worked on the video.

On most stations, a radio edit changes the subtitle (normally "Oh shit!" to "Oh, snap!", to prevent bleeping or blanking). This edit was also used in the music video.

Fergie performed the song at the beginning of So You Think You Can Dance''. Also, on the same show, a dance set to "London Bridge" was choreographed by Shane Sparks, and performed on July 19 by Travis Wall and Donyelle Jones. A remix of "London Bridge" also surfaced featuring only 50 Cent, with Fergie providing the titular phrase as a backing vocal. Pop punk band Bowling for Soup have also released a download only live version of the song.

==Music video==

Fergie collaborated with her fellow member of the will.i.am, on the clip's concept to make it more distinctive. She describes the concept as follows: "We're doing this androgynous-type thing where [my girls and I] go into a Gentlemen's club and pull them into a bathroom and come back out in their clothes. They're going to be dressed up really dapper and looking really handsome. (sic) "<ref name="MTV" />

For the video, which was filmed at the Woolwich Army Barracks in cholas — tough Mexican girls known for wearing dark lipstick and big hair — to make the clip "have a bit more edge, be very distinct, be very mixed."<ref name="MTV" />

In scenes of the video Fergie is in a boat going down the River Thames in front of Tower Bridge, which could confuse some people into thinking Tower Bridge was London Bridge, which it is not.

Fergie based one of her outfits for the video on her family's crest and tartan, with some changes as she wanted it to be modernized.<ref name="MTV" /> She also wears a Sarah Ferguson).<ref name="MTV" />
