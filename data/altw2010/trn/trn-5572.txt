Based on the competition winning entry by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, the Sydney Opera House is one of the world's most distinctive 20th century buildings, and one of the most famous performing arts venues in the world.  It was among the 20 selected finalists in the 2007 New Seven Wonders of the World project. 

The Sydney Opera House  is situated on Bennelong Point in Sydney Harbour, close to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The building and its surroundings are one of the best known icons of Australia. 

As well as many touring theatre, ballet, and musical productions, the Opera House is the home of Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony. It is administered by the Sydney Opera House Trust, under the New South Wales Ministry of the Arts.

The Sydney expressionist modern design, with a series of large precast concrete 'shells', each taken from a hemisphere of the same radius, forming the roofs of the structure.  The Opera House covers 1.8 hectares (4.5 acres) of land. It is 183 metres (605 feet) long and about 120 metres (388 feet) wide at its widest point. It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk up to 25 metres below sea level. Its power supply is equivalent for a town of 25,000 people. The power is distributed by 645 kilometres of electrical cable.

The roofs of the House are covered with 1.056 million glossy white and matte cream Swedish-made tiles<ref>{{cite web

The Concert Hall and Opera Theatre are each contained in the two largest groups of shells, and the other theatres are located on the sides of the shell groupings. The form of the shells is chosen to reflect the internal height requirements, rising from the low entrance spaces, over the seating areas and up to the high stage towers. A much smaller group of shells set to one side of the Monumental steps houses the Bennelong Restaurant. Although the roof structures of the Sydney Opera House are commonly referred to as shells (as they are in this article), they are in fact not shells in a strictly structural sense, but are instead precast concrete panels supported by precast concrete ribs. The building's interior is composed of pink granite quarried in Tarana and Wauchope in northern New South Wales.<ref>{{cite web

===Performance venues and facilities===  
thumb|right|The Concert Hall and [[Sydney Opera House Grand Organ|Grand Organ]]

The Sydney Opera House contains five  main performance spaces, other areas used for performances, a recording studio, five restaurants, and four souvenir shops.

The five venues making up the main performance facilities:
* The '''Concert Hall''', with 2,679 seats, is the home of the Sydney Symphony, and used by a large number of other concert presenters. It contains the Sydney Opera House Grand Organ, the largest mechanical tracker action organ in the world with over 10,000 pipes.
* The '''Opera Theatre''', a proscenium theatre with 1,547 seats, is the Sydney home of Opera Australia and The Australian Ballet. 
* The '''Drama Theatre''', a proscenium theatre  with 544 seats, is used by the Sydney Theatre Company and other dance and theatrical presenters
* The '''Playhouse''', an end-stage theatre with 398 seats
* The '''Studio''', a flexible space, with a maximum capacity of 400 people, depending on configuration
Other spaces used for performances and other events include:
* The '''Utzon Room''' , a small multi-purpose venue, seating up to 210. It is the only interior space to have been designed by Utzon, having been renovated in 2004 under his direction.  
* The '''Forecourt''', a flexible open-air venue with a wide range of configuration options, including utilising the Monumental Steps as audience seating, used for a range of community events, Live Sites, and special-occasion performances
 
Besides theatrical productions and concerts, venues at the Sydney Opera House are also used for activities such as conferences, ceremonies, and social functions.

==Construction history==
===Origins===

Planning for the Sydney Opera House began in the late 1940s when Eugene Goossens, the Director of the NSW State Conservatorium of Music, lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions. The normal venue for such productions, the Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of NSW Premier Wynyard Railway Station in the north-west of the CBD.

The competition was launched by Cahill on 13 September 1955 and received a total of 233 entries from 32 countries. The criteria specified a large hall seating 3000 and a small hall for 1200 people, each to be designed for different uses including full-scale operas, orchestral and choral concerts, mass meetings, lectures, ballet performances and other presentations.<ref>{{cite book

===Design and construction of the Opera House===
right|thumb|Construction progress in 1968

The Fort Macquarie Tram Depot, occupying the site at the time of these plans, was demolished in 1958, and formal construction of the Opera House began in March, 1959. The project was built in three stages. Stage I (1959&ndash;1963) consisted of building the upper podium. Stage II (1963&ndash;1967) saw the construction of the outer shells. Stage III consisted of the interior design and construction (1967&ndash;73). 

====Stage I: Podium====

Stage I commenced on December 5, 1958, by the construction firm Civil & Civic. The government had pushed for work to begin early fearing that funding, or public opinion, might turn against them. However major structural issues still plagued the design (most notably the sails, which were still parabolic at the time). By January 23, 1961, work was running 47 weeks behind, mainly because of unexpected difficulties (inclement weather, unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater, construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared, changes of original contract documents). Work on the podium was finally completed on August 31, 1962. The forced early start led to significant later problems, not least of which was the fact that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure, and had to be re-built.<ref name="PMurray">{{cite book

====Stage II: Roof====

thumbnail|right|Sydney Opera House shell ribsThe shells of the competition entry were originally of undefined geometry,<ref>Arup, Ove and Zunz, G.J.: Article in ''Structural Engineer'' Volume 47, March 1969</ref> but early in the design process the "shells" were perceived as a series of parabolas supported by precast concrete ribs. However, engineers Ove Arup and partners were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them. The formwork for using in-situ concrete would have been prohibitively expensive, but because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly be even more expensive.  

From 1957 to 1963 the design team went through at least twelve iterations of the form of the shells trying to find an economically acceptable form (including schemes with parabolas, circular ribs and ellipsoids) before a workable solution was completed. The design work on the shells involved one of the earliest uses of computers in structural analysis in order to understand the complex forces the shells would be subject to.<ref name="PJones">Jones, Peter: ''Ove Arup: Masterbuilder of the Twentieth Century''. Yale University Press, 2006.</ref> In mid-1961 the design team found a solution to the problem: the shells all being created as sections from a sphere. 

With whom exactly this solution originated has been the subject of some controversy.  It was originally credited to Utzon. Ove Arup's letter to Ashworth, a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee, states: "Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions."<ref name="PJones">page 199</ref> Peter Jones, the author of Ove Arup's biography, states that "the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise ''eureka'' moment ...; the engineers and some of their associates, with equal conviction, recall discussion in both central London and at Ove's house". He goes on to claim that "the existing evidence shows that Arup's canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells, from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres."<ref name="PJones" /> Yuzo Mikami, a member of the design team, presents an opposite view in his book on the project, ''Utzon's Sphere''.<ref name="sphere"></ref><ref>Mikami, Yuzo: ''Utzon's Sphere'', Tokyo: Shoku Kusha. 2001.</ref> It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known, but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and Utzon, Arup, and Ronald Jenkins (partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project) all played a very significant part in the design development.<ref name="findarticles"></ref>
As Peter Murray states in ''The Saga of the Sydney Opera House''<ref name="PMurray">Murray, P: ''The Saga of the Sydney Opera House'', 2004, Spon Press (UK), ISBN 0415325218</ref>:

The shells were constructed by Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd<ref>[http://www.bilfingerberger.com/C1257130005050D5/vwContentByKey/W26U3AX8814LUNADE/$FILE/bb_historie_en.html Bilfinger Berger corporate history]</ref>, who were also responsible for construction in Stage III. Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on-site factory, and also developed the construction processes.<ref name="PMurray" /> The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units (it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground, instead of being stuck on individually at height). Ove Arup and Partners' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells which used an innovative adjustable steel trussed 'erection arch' to support the different roofs before completion. On April 6, 1962 it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965. By the end of 1965, the estimated finish for stage II was July 1967.

====Stage III: Interiors====

Stage III, the interiors, started with Utzon moving his entire office to Sydney in February 1963. However, there was a change of government in 1965, and the new Robert Askin government declared the project under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works. This ultimately led to Utzon's resignation (see below).

The cost of the project so far, even in October of that year, was still only $22.9 million, less than a quarter of the final cost. However the projected costs for the design were at this stage much more significant.

In 1966, following Utzon's resignation, the acoustic advisor, Lothar Cremer, confirmed to SOHEC that Utzon's original acoustic design only allowed for 2000 seats in the main hall, and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3000 as specified in the brief would be disastrous for the acoustics.  According to Peter Jones, the stage designer, Martin Carr, criticised the "shape, height and width of the stage, the physical facilities for artists, the location of the dressing rooms, the widths of doors and lifts, and the location of lighting switchboards".<ref name="PJones">page203</ref>

The second stage of construction was still in process when Utzon resigned. His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall, who became largely responsible for the interior design. Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E.H. Farmer as government architect, D.S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd.

The four significant changes to the design after Utzon left were:
# The cladding to the podium and the paving (the podium was originally not to be clad down to the water, but to be left open).
# The construction of the glass walls (Utzon was planning to use a system of prefabricated plywood mullions, but a different system was designed to deal with the glass).
# Use of the halls (The major hall which was originally to be a multipurpose opera/concert hall, became solely a concert hall, called the Concert Hall. The minor hall, originally for stage productions only, had the added function of opera and ballet to deal with and is called the Opera Theatre. As a result, the "Opera Theatre" is inadequate to stage large scale opera and ballet. A theatre, a cinema and a library were also added, (later changed to two live drama theatres and a studio). These changes were primarily because of inadequacies in the original competition brief, which did not make it adequately clear how the Opera House was to be used. The layout of the interiors was changed and the stage machinery, already designed and fitted inside the major hall, was pulled out and largely thrown away.
# The interior designs: Utzon's plywood corridor designs, and his acoustic and seating designs for the interior of both major halls, were scrapped completely. His design for the Concert Hall was rejected as it only seated 2000, which was considered insufficient.<ref name="PJones"/> Utzon employed the acoustic consultant Lothar Cremer, and his designs for the major halls were later modelled and found to be very good. The subsequent Todd, Hall and Littlemore versions of both major halls have some problems with acoustics, particularly for the performing musicians. The orchestra pit in the Opera Theatre is cramped and dangerous to musicians' hearing.<ref></ref> The Concert Hall has a very high roof leading to lack of early reflections onstage - perspex rings (the "acoustic clouds") hanging over the stage were added shortly before opening in an (unsuccessful) attempt to address this problem.

The Opera House was formally completed in 1973, having cost $102 million. H.R. ‘Sam’ Hoare, the Hornibrook director in charge of the project, provided the following approximations in 1973:
Stage I: podium Civil & Civic P/L approximately $5.5m.  
Stage II: roof shells M.R. Hornibrook (NSW) P/L approximately $12.5m.  
Stage III: completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5m.  
Separate contracts: stage equipment, stage lighting and organ $9.0m.  
Fees and other costs $16.5m.

The original cost estimate in 1957 was £3,500,000 ($7 million). The original completion date set by the government was January 26, 1963.<ref name="PJones">ref</ref>

===Utzon and his resignation===

Before the Sydney Opera House competition, Utzon had won seven of the eighteen competitions he had entered, but had never seen any of his designs built.<ref name="PJones">page174</ref> Utzon's submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking. The Assessors Report of January 1957, stated:

For the first stage of the project Utzon worked very successfully with the rest of the design team and the client, but as the project progressed it became clear (with the revised hall usage insisted by the clients) that the competition requirements had been inadequate with regards to acoustics, specifications of performance spaces and other areas, and that the client had not appreciated the costs or work involved in design and construction. Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design.

Das '''Sydney Opera House''' (''Opernhaus von Sydney'') ist eines der markantesten und berühmtesten Gebäude des 20. Jahrhunderts und das Wahrzeichen von Sydney. Es geht auf den Entwurf des dänischen Architekten und Pritzker-Preis-Trägers Jørn Utzon zurück. 2007 ehrte die UNESCO das Haus als UNESCO-Welterbe.

== Maße ==
thumb|Nahansicht der Oberfläche (Fliesen)
Das Gebäude ist 183 Meter lang, 118 Meter breit und bedeckt eine Fläche von etwa 1,8 Hektar. Sein unverwechselbares Dach ragt 67 Meter hoch auf und ist mit 1.056.000 glasierten, weißen Keramikfliesen verkleidet, die aus Schweden importiert wurden. 580 Pfähle, die 25 Meter tief in den Boden ragen, tragen das etwa 160.000 Tonnen schwere Bauwerk.

== Innengestaltung ==
Das Opernhaus enthält fünf Theater mit insgesamt 5532 Sitzplätzen: Die ''Concert Hall'' (Konzerthalle) mit 2679 Sitzen, das ''Opera Theatre'' (Operntheater) mit 1547 Sitzen, das ''Drama Theatre'' mit 544 Sitzen, das ''Playhouse'' mit 398 Sitzen und das ''Studio Theatre'' mit 364 Sitzen.
Insgesamt gibt es rund 100 Räume, darunter 5 Probestudios, ein Kino, 60 Umkleideräume, 4 Restaurants, 6 Bars und zahlreiche Andenkenläden.
Die Stromversorgung wäre ausreichend für eine Stadt mit 25.000 Einwohnern und umfasst 645 Kilometer an elektrischen Kabeln.

== Entstehung ==
thumb|Sydney Opera House vor der [[Sydney Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]]
thumb|Sydney Opera House
Ende der 1940er Jahre reifte in Sydney die Idee heran, dass auch diese Stadt ein Opernhaus haben sollte. Repräsentatives Aussehen eines solchen Baues wurde auch als hilfreich angesehen.

Als Bauplatz hatte man den ''Bennelong Point'', eine der City vorgelagerte Halbinsel im Hafen auf der anderen Seite der 1932 fertiggestellten Hafenbrücke ins Auge gefasst. Die nach einem australischen Ureinwohner benannte Lokalität wurde zuletzt als Straßenbahnreparaturzentrum verwendet, war aber, nachdem diese Form des öffentlichen Personennahverkehrs gegen den Autoverkehr den Kürzeren zog, zum industriellen Brachland verkommen - ein Schandfleck in prominenter Lage.

Finanzielle Beschränkungen gab es bei dem Projekt Opernhaus nicht. Zur Finanzierung wurde eine Lotterie veranstaltet, die sehr erfolgreich verlief.

Die internationale Ausschreibung, zu der 233 Vorschläge eingereicht wurden, gewann 1957 der schon damals renommierte dänische Architekt Jørn Utzon, der sich hier allerdings zum ersten mal international versuchte. Unter anderem wurde ihm auch vom modernistischen austro-australischen Architekten Harry Seidler eine ehrenvolle Erwähnung zuteil. Utzons Entwurf verstieß zwar gegen die Wettbewerbsregeln, da er nur eine recht grobe Skizze einreichte. Dennoch erwies sich die Wahl seines Entwurfes als Glücksgriff, nicht nur für Sydney, sondern auch für die Weltarchitektur.

Utzons Entwurf erinnert an die Segel eines Schiffes, was gut zur Geltung kommt, da das Opernhaus direkt am Meer gebaut wurde. In den 1990er Jahren eröffnete der Architekt aber, dass die Segmente einer Orange der Formgebung zugrunde liegen.

1959 begannen die Bauarbeiten. Die gekrümmten Schalen des Daches bereiteten jedoch große Probleme, da sie nur schwer zu berechnen waren. Oft war architektonisches Neuland zu betreten und Probleme wurden bereinigt, wie sie sich stellten. Der Entwurf musste des Öfteren an neue Realitäten angepasst werden.

Dies trug dazu bei, dass die ursprünglich veranschlagten Baukosten von £ 3.5 Millionen am Ende bei über £ 50 Millionen, also dann 100 Millionen Australische Dollar lagen und der Termin der Fertigstellung vom 26. Januar, also dem Nationalfeiertag Australia Day von 1965, auf das Jahr 1973 verschoben werden musste.

Die steigenden Baukosten, aber auch künstlerische Differenzen führten zum Zerwürfnis zwischen der federführenden Regierung des Australischen Bundesstaates New South Wales unter dem konservativen Premierminister Robert Askin und dem Architekten. Der Höhepunkt der höchstöffentlich ausgetragenen Auseinandersetzung war 1966 die Demission Utzons, der quasi über Nacht Australien verließ und nie wieder einen Fuß auf den fünften Kontinent setzen sollte.

Eine Gruppe junger australischer Architekten brachte das Werk zu Ende. Utzon war überzeugt, dass die getroffenen Kompromisse das Werk ruinieren würden, und bei der Eröffnung gaben ihm Kritiker und Künstler teilweise Recht. Vor allem die kostengünstige Ausführung größter Teile des Interieurs und die Akustik wurden häufig bemängelt.

Am 20. Oktober 1973 wurde das Opernhaus offiziell von Königin Elisabeth II., dem formellen Staatsoberhaupt Australiens, seiner Bestimmung übergeben.
