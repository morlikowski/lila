== Причини ==
Според немската магистрали за Източна Прусия. Според самия Хитлер „става дума за разширение на жизненото пространство и осигуряване на снабдяването, както и за решение на балтийския проблем“. На войната срещу Полша се гледа като на първи етап от борбата за световно господство. Успешното завършване на войната с Полша значително би подобрило позициите на Германия спрямо европейските и&#768; съперници - Англия и Франция, които в лицето на Полша биха загубили своя съюзник на изток. През лятото на 1939 г. в Европа се създава ситуация, която е благоприятна за Германия - англо-френско-полската коалиция не представлява едно цяло нито във военно, нито в политическо отношение - засилена е увереността, че Англия и Франция няма да предприемат сериозни мерки при евентуално нападение над Полша. Освен това Германия изпреварва своите противници в подготовката за война.

== Стратегически цели на страните ==
=== На Германия ===
*Унищожаване на суверенитета на Полша.
*Изваждане на Полша максимално бързо като съюзник на Англия и Франция, при евентуална война на запад.
*Получаване на допълнителен военноикономически ресурс за последващо настъпление на запад или изток.
*Осигуряване на плацдарм при бъдещо настъпление срещу СССР.

=== На Полша ===
*Довеждане до незабавно и автоматично включване на западните държави от момента на започване на военните действия.
*Превръщане на полско-германската война във война на Германия с коалицията на западните държави и Полша.
*До началото на очакваните операции от страна на съюзниците, полските въоръжени сили трябва да водят бойни действия с превъзхождащ ги противник. След включването на западните съюзници се предвижда контранастъпление и сключване на изгоден за Полша мир.

== Оперативни планове на страните ==
=== На немското командване ===
Г.Рундщет, получава задача да настъпи от територията на немска Силезия в общо направление към Варшава, да разгроми полските армии, развърнати на приграничния рубеж, да излезе на р.Висла и във взаимодействие с група армии „Север“ да унищожи войските, които са останали в Западна Полша.
* Група армии „Юг“ трябва да нанесе главен удар със силите на 10-а армия (под командването на Райхенау), която има най-много танкови и моторизирани съединения, в направление Ченстохова, Варшава. Като използва своите подвижни войски, 10-а армия трябва колкото може по-бързо да излезе към Висла на участъка между устията на реките Бзура и Вепш.
* На север се развръща 8-а армия (под командването на Бласковиц), която има за задача да настъпи към големия промишлен център Лодз, а също така да прикрие северния фланг на 10-а армия.
* 14-а армия (под командването на Лист) има за задача да нанесе удар в направление Краков, да разгроми полските войски в Горна Силезия, да овладее плацдарми на река Дунаец и да развие настъплението към Сандомир, като се стреми да не допусне създаване на полски отбранителен рубеж на реките Сан и Висла.
* Резервът на Рундщет се състои от пет пехотни съединения. Действията на група армии „Юг“ се поддържат от 4-и въздушен флот на генерал А.Льор.

Група армии „Север“ (командващ генерал-полковник Федор фон Бок) в състав 3-а и 4-а армия (всичко 21 дивизии, от които 2 танкови и 2 моторизирани) има за задача да настъпи от територията на Померания и Източна Прусия в общо направление към Варшава и във взаимодействие със съединенията на група армии „Юг“ да унищожи полските войски северно от р.Висла.
* 4-а армия (под командването на Клуге) трябва да нанесе удар от немска Померания, във взаимодействие със съединенията на 3-а армия да овладее източния бряг на р.Висла в района на Хелмно и да настъпи в югоизточно направление към Варшава.
* 3-а армия (под командването на Кюхлер) от Източна Прусия трябва да действа срещу полските войски северно от р.Нарев и впоследствие да настъпи към Варшава и Селдце.
* Действията на група армии „Север“ се поддържат от авиацията на 1-ви въздушен флот на генерал А.Кеселринг.

Между групите армии „Юг“ и „Север“ по дъгата, образувана от реките Одер и Варта, немското командване оставя минимално количество войски, на които се възлага задачата със своите действия да заблудят противника относно направлението на главните удари и да сковат полската армия „Познан“.

Главното командване на сухопътните войски съсредоточава основните си сили в първи ешелон на настъпващите групировки. Оперативните резерви се създават в хода на кампанията за сметка на прехвърлените от Германия мобилизирани дивизии.
В състава на сухопътните сили на Германия, отделени за войната срещу Полша, има 62 дивизии (между които 7 танкови, 4 леки и 4 моторизирани) и 2800 танка. Сутринта на 1-ви септември на границата в готовност се намират 54 дивизии (без дивизиите на гарнизонните крепости, укрепените райони и съединенията на граничната охрана).

В състава на 1-ви и 4-ти въздушен флот се намират около 2&nbsp;000 самолета - на авиацията са поставени задачи да прикрива районите за съсредоточаване на немските войски и да завоюва и удържи господство във въздуха.

'''The Invasion of Poland, 1939''' (in ''Fall Weiss''," "Case White," by the German General Staff, and sometimes called "'''the Polish-German War of 1939'''"), which precipitated German-allied Slovak contingent. 

The invasion of World War II in Europe, as Poland's western allies, the declared war on Germany on among others. The invasion began on September 1 1939, one week after the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and ended October 6 1939, with Germany and the Soviet Union occupying the entirety of Poland. Although the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany soon after Germany attacked Poland, very little direct military aid was provided (see Phoney War and Western betrayal).

In the aftermath of the September Campaign, a resistance movement was formed. Poland's fighting forces continued to contribute to Allied military operations throughout World War II. Germany captured the Soviet-occupied areas of Poland when it invaded the Soviet Union on June 22 1941, and lost the territory in 1944 to an advancing Red Army. Over the course of the war, Poland lost over 20% of its pre-war population under an occupation that marked the end of the Second Polish Republic.

==Opposing forces==

===Germany===

Germany had a substantial numerical advantage over Poland and had developed a significant military prior to the conflict. The ''Heer'' (army) had some 2,400 encircled and destroyed. This would be followed up by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The ''Luftwaffe'' (air force) provided both tactical and strategic air power, particularly dive bombers that disrupted lines of supply and communications. Together, the new methods were nicknamed ''Blitzkrieg'' (lightning war). Historian Basil Liddell Hart and A. J. P. Taylor conclude "Poland was a full demonstration of the Blitzkrieg theory."<ref>B.H.Hart & A.J.P Taylor, p41</ref>

Bombers also attacked cities, causing huge losses amongst the civilian population through Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers, 1,100 conventional bombers (mainly He 111s and Dornier Do 17s), and an assortment of 550 transport and 350 reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Bombers of the Luftwaffe, Joachim Dressel and Manfred Griehl, Arms and Armour, 1994</ref><ref>The Flying pencil, Heinz J. Nowarra, Schiffer Publishing,1990,p25</ref> In total, Germany had close to 4,000 aircraft, all up to modern standards. A force of 2,315 aircraft were assigned to ''Weiss''.<ref>A History of World War Two, A.J.P Taylor, Octopus, 1974, p35</ref>  Due to its prior participation in the Spanish Civil War, the ''Luftwaffe'' was probably the most experienced, best trained and well equipped air force in the world in 1939.

=== Poland ===
thumb|left|Polish [[7TP light tank.]]thumb|right|Polish Infantry

Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in Central Industrial Region. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced. In 1936, a National Defence Fund was set up collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The Polish Army had approximately a million soldiers, but less than half of them were mobilized by September 1. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the ''Luftwaffe''. The Polish military had fewer armoured forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the enemy.

Experiences in the Polish-Soviet War shaped Polish Army organisational and operational doctrine. Unlike the trench warfare of the First World War, the Polish-Soviet War was a conflict in which the cavalry's mobility played a decisive role. Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unwilling to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then. In spite of this, Polish cavalry brigades were used as a mobile mounted infantry and had some successes against both German infantry and cavalry.

thumb|left|Polish [[PZL.37 Łoś medium bomber.]]

The Polish Air Force (''Lotnictwo Wojskowe'') was at a severe disadvantage against the German ''Luftwaffe'', although it was ''not'' destroyed on the ground early on, as is commonly believed. The Polish Air Force lacked modern fighter aircraft, but its pilots were among the world's best trained, as proven a year later in the Battle of Britain, in which the Poles played a major part.<ref name="Peszke">Michael Alfred Peszke, ''Polish Underground Army, the Western Allies, and the Failure of Strategic Unity in World War II'', McFarland & Company, 2004, ISBN 0-7864-2009-X, [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN078642009X&id=zhb2doihL1wC&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=Polish+pilots+highly+trained&sig=yWoszV8u_z1PsQrdQLkkL5TknZo Google Print, p.2]</ref>

Overall, the Germans enjoyed numerical and qualitative aircraft superiority.  Poland had only about 600 modern aircraft.  The Polish Air Force had roughly 185 fighters, 175 PZL.23 Karaś B, 35 Karaś A, and by September, over 100 PZL.37 Łoś were produced <ref>Adam Kurowski 'Lotnictwo Polskie 1939' 129 P-11c (+43 reserve), 30 P-7 (+85 reserve), 118 P-23 Karaś light bombers, 36 P-37 Łoś bombers (armed in line, additionally a few of the total number produced were used in combat), 84 reconneisance RXIII Lublin, RWD14 Czapla (+115 reserve)</ref>.  There were also over a thousand obsolete transport, reconnaissance and training aircraft.  However, for the September Campaign, only some 70% of those aircraft were mobilised.  Only 36 PZL.37 Łoś bombers were deployed. All those aircraft were of indigenous Polish design, with the bombers being more modern than fighters, according to the Ludomil Rayski air force expansion plan, which relied on a strong bomber force.  The Polish fighters were a generation older than their German counterparts.  The Polish PZL P.11 fighter, produced in the early 1930s, was capable of only 365 km/h (approximately 220 mi/hr), far less than German bombers; to compensate, the pilots relied on its maneuvrability and high diving speed.

The Operation Peking, leaving Polish ports on merchant marine ships joined the British merchant fleet and took part in wartime convoys.

The tank force consisted of two armoured brigades, four independent tank battalions and some 30 companies of TKS tankettes attached to infantry divisions and cavalry brigades.

== Prelude to the campaign ==

The Nazi Party, led by Adolf Hitler, took power in Germany in 1933.  At first, Hitler pursued a policy of rapprochement with Poland, culminating in the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934.  Early foreign policy worked to maneuver Poland into the Anti-Comintern Pact, forming a cooperative front against the Soviet Union. Germany sought to grab Soviet territory, acquire Lebensraum and expand Großdeutschland.[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0801864933&id=w-IQu7nWQwQC&pg=PA188&lpg=PA187&dq=poland+mitteleuropa&sig=deyy3OAO9MCOhW58ErgMFcmVYCM] Poland would be granted territory of its own, to its northeast, but the concessions the Poles were expected to make meant that their homeland would become largely dependent on Germany, functioning as little more than a client state and Polish independence would eventually be threatened altogether.[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0631186018&id=S2hBXzB7XaYC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&printsec=8&dq=anti-comintern+Poland&sig=IFzcgJe_r1_ODdLAzYbk4xveCzY]

In addition to Soviet territory, the Nazis were also interested in establishing a new border with Poland because the German exclave of East Prussia was separated from the rest of the Reich by the "Polish Corridor".  Many Germans also wanted to incorporate the Free City of Danzig into Germany.  While Danzig had a predominantly German population, the Corridor constituted land long disputed by Poland and Germany.  After the Treaty of Versailles, Poland acquired the Corridor, which was part of territory taken by Prussia in Partitions of Poland. Hitler sought to reverse this trend and made an appeal to German nationalism, promising to "liberate" the German minority still in the Corridor, as well as Danzig, since the port city was under the control of the League of Nations.

Poland participated in the partition of Czechoslovakia that followed the Munich Agreement, although they were not part of the agreement. It coerced Czechoslovakia to surrender the city of Český Těšín by issuing an ultimatum to that effect on September 30, which was accepted by Czechoslovakia on  October 1.<ref>Nowa Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN 1997, vol. VI, 981.</ref>

In 1938, Germany began to increase its demands for Danzig, while proposing that a roadway be built in order to connect East Prussia with Germany proper, running through the Polish Corridor.[http://www.euronet.nl/~jlemmens/autobahn.html] Poland rejected this proposal, fearing that after accepting these demands, it would become increasingly subject to the will of Germany and eventually lose its independence as the Czechs had.[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/yellow/ylbk113.htm] The Poles also distrusted Hitler and his intentions.[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/yellow/ylbk113.htm] At the same time, Germany's collaboration with anti-Polish Ukrainian nationalists from the Britain and Lord Halifax, still hoped to strike a deal with Hitler regarding Danzig (and possibly the Polish Corridor), and Hitler hoped for the same.  By again resorting to appeasement, Chamberlain and his supporters believed war could be avoided and hoped Germany would agree to leave the rest of Poland alone.  German hegemony over Central Europe was also at stake.

With tensions mounting, Germany turned to aggressive diplomacy.  On April 28 1939, it unilaterally withdrew from both the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 and the London Naval Agreement of 1935.  In early 1939, Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible "solution of the Polish problem by military means." Another crucial step towards war was the surprise signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact on August 23, the denouement of secret Nazi-Soviet talks held in Moscow, which capitalized on France and Britain's own failure to secure an alliance with the Soviet Union.  As a result, Germany neutralized the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland. In a secret protocol of this pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two spheres of influence; the western third of the country was to go to Germany and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviet Union.

The German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 04:00 on August 26. However, on August 25, the Polish-British Common Defence Pact was signed as an annex to the Franco-Polish Military Alliance. In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussions - not at all how Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until September 1, managing to halt the entire invasion "in mid-leap", with the exception of a few units that were out of communication, towards the south (the Nazi press announced that fanatical Slovakians were behind a cross border raid).

On August 26, Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict, even pledging that the Wehrmacht forces would be made available to Britain's empire in the future.<ref>http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t295s04.html see also the original [http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a295s04.html] </ref> In any case, the negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the lack of ''territorial guarantees'' to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland. Meanwhile, the number of increased overflights by high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and cross border troop movements signalled that war was imminent.

On August 29, prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with ''Case White'' yet to be rescheduled. At midnight on August 29, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop handed British Ambassador Sir Neville Henderson the list of terms which would allegedly ensure peace in regards to Poland. Danzig was to be returned to Germany (Gdynia would remain with Poland), and there was to be a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor, based on residency in 1919, within the year.<ref>''Documents Concerning the Last Phase of the German-Polish Crisis'', Proposal for a settlement of the Danzig and the Polish Corridor Problem as well as of the question concerning the German and Polish Minorities (New York: German Library of Information), p 33–35...'''see also:''' ''Documents Concerning German-Polish Relations and the Outbreak of Hostilities Between Great Britain and Germany on September 3, 1939'' (Miscellaneous No. 9) Message which was communicated to H.M.

On August 30, the Polish" attack on the radio station) was staged near the German border city of Gleiwitz, in Upper Silesia. On August 31 1939, Hitler ordered hostilities against Poland to start at 4:45 the next morning. Because of the prior stoppage, Poland managed to mobilise only 70% of its planned forces, and many units were still forming or moving to their designated frontline positions.

===Plans===
====German plan====
The German plan for what became known as the September Campaign was devised by General German tanks and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the Schützen regiments, forerunners of the localized parts of the enemy front, eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them. The pre-war ''armored idea'' (which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed Blitzkrieg), which was advocated by some generals, including Heinz Guderian, would have had the armor punching holes in the enemy's front and ranging deep into rear areas, but in actuality, the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines. This stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German high command, who mainly restricted the role of armor and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.

Poland's terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather cooperated - the country had flat Slovakia meant that Poland's southern flank was exposed.

German planners intended to fully exploit their long border with the great enveloping manoeuvre of Fall Weiss. German units were to invade Poland from three directions:
* A main attack over the western Polish border. This was to be carried out by Army Group South commanded by General Carpathian flank; and General Walter von Reichenau's 10th Army, in the centre with Army Group South's armour, was to deliver the decisive blow with a northestward thrust into the heart of Poland.
* A second route of attack from northern Prussia. General Fedor von Bock commanded Army Group North, comprising General Georg von Küchler's 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General Günther von Kluge's 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the Polish Corridor.
* A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South's allied Slovak units from  Slovakia.
* From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations through ''Selbstschutz'' units prepared before the war.

All three assaults were to converge on encircled and destroyed west of the Vistula. Fall Weiss was initiated on September 1 1939, and was the first operation of the Second World War in Europe.

The Polish defense plan, ''Zachód'' (''West''), was shaped by political determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, based upon Western Allies launched their own promised offensive.

The Polish Army's most pessimistic fall-back plan involved retreat behind the river San to the southeastern voivodships and their lengthy defence (the Romanian bridgehead plan). The British and French estimated that Poland should be able to defend that region for two to three months, while Poland estimated it could hold for at least six months. This Polish plan was based around the expectation that the Western Allies would keep their end of the signed alliance treaty and quickly start an offensive of their own. However, neither the French nor the British government made plans to attack Germany while the Polish campaign was being fought. In addition, they expected the war to develop into trench warfare much like World War I had, forcing the Germans to sign a peace treaty restoring Poland's borders. The Polish government, however, was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies.<ref name="Piątkowski"> </ref><ref name="Raczyński"> </ref>
