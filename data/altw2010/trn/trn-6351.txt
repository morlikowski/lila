== Locomotives ==

Chittaranjan is well known for ''Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW)'', which manufactures mainline electric broad gauge locomotives.  This factory commenced production in 1950; and up to 1972, it was involved in the production of Broad Gauge & Metre Gauge Steam Locomotives such as WG, WP (Broad Gauge goods & passenger) and YP, YG (Metre Gauge goods & passenger).  Production of Electric Locomotives commenced in 1963 (with technical assistance of SNCF of France), when the late Sri Jawaharlal Nehru, then Prime Minister Of India, dedicated the first mainline Broad Gauge Electric Locomotive titled 'BIDHAN' and of the class WAG1 to the nation.<p>  In addition to steam and electric locomotives, CLW also produced Narrow Gauge (762mm) diesel locomotives of the ZDM class and Broad Gauge Hydraulic shunting locomotives of the WDS4 class.  Production of steam locomotives was discontinued in 1972, when the last steam locomotive titled 'ANTIM SITARA' (The Last Star) was rolled out.  Towards the early 90s production of diesel locomotives in CLW was discontinued altogether. 

<p> In the mid 90s' under a Transfer-Of-Technology agreement with the Indian Railways, Msrs ABB of Switzerland helped CLW produce the 3-phase 5000 HP locos under the WAP-5 & WAP-7 classes (Passenger Traffic) and WAG-9 class (Freight Traffic). Currently, CLW produces electric locomotives of WAP-4, WAP-5 & WAP-7 classes (Passenger Traffic) and WAG-7 & WAG-9 (Freight Traffic)
