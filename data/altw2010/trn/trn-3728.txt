泰迪熊以美国总统黑熊，而罗斯福拒绝杀掉这只被套住的小熊，并且还称之为“无体育道德的”（），随后一个政治漫画家迅速出版漫画《泰迪熊》（）。第一部漫画在第二天即11月6日便出现了。克利福德·K·贝里曼（），一位《华盛顿邮报》的漫画编辑，以头版漫画的形式记录了这件事。贝里曼画的是小熊坐在地上，罗斯福那着枪，背对着小熊，做着拒绝杀死猎物的手势。画面的下方写着“在密西西比州划界”（），把打猎逸事同政治争论联系起来（见左图）。

俄裔移民莫里斯·米奇汤姆（，）和他的妻子罗丝（，）1903年2月15日不久在他们纽约布鲁克林的商店里展示了两只毛绒小熊并声称他们有罗斯福总统的书面许可称这种小熊为“泰迪熊”（Teddy's bears）。

德国玩具制造者玛格丽特·史泰福（）于1880年开始制造毛绒动物玩具。第一个作品是一只小象。1902年她的侄子理查德·史泰福（）说服她制造玩具熊。玩具熊在当时的德国不是很流行。但在1903年莱比锡玩具交易会上，他们卖给一个美国商人3000只小熊。米奇汤姆的熊（Michtom's bear）有一张惹人喜爱的娃娃脸，而史泰福出产的玩具熊在样貌上更像一只真正的熊。现在史泰福公司仍在德国生产泰迪熊并向全世界出口。

一些泰迪熊被提供给孩子们玩耍，另一些是为成人设计的，也被称作“收藏者项目”或“设计者熊偶”。第一种类型的泰迪熊通常是未直接连接的，头、手臂和双腿是被缝合在身体上的。另一种为成人设计的类型就基本上是直接连接的了，这就是说，泰迪熊的头和四肢通过体内关节铁架与身体连接，可以活动。

The '''teddy bear''' is a stuffed toy bear. It is an enduring, traditional form of stuffed animal, often serving the purpose of comforting children. In recent times, some teddy bears have become expensive collector's items. Teddy bear collectors are known as arctophiles from the Greek words 'arcto' (bear) and 'philos' (lover).

==History==
The name Teddy Bear comes from one of American President Clifford Berryman in The Washington Post on November 16 1902.<ref name="Clay"></ref> While the initial cartoon of an adult black bear lassoed by a white handler and a disgusted Roosevelt had symbolic overtones, later issues of that and other Berryman cartoons made the bear smaller and cuter.<ref>[http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/tr_teddy.htm  Theodore Roosevelt Association.

At the same time, in Germany the Steiff firm, unaware of Michtom's bear, produced a stuffed bear from Richard Steiff's designs. They exhibited the toy at the Leipzig Toy Fair in March 1903 and exported 3000 to the United States.<ref name="t"></ref><ref name="LoC"/><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2537943.stm Teddy bear celebrates 100th birthday] BBC, 2002-12-03</ref>

By 1906 manufacturers other than Michtom and Steiff had joined in and the craze for Teddy Bears was such that ladies carried them everywhere, children were photographed with them, and Roosevelt used one as a mascot in his bid for re-election.<ref name="t"/>

===Legend===
While the Mississippi history is fact, another legend of how the teddy bear got its name comes from the American state of Colorado.

In 1905, the Hotel Colorado in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, became the temporary home for the President of the United States and his assistants during a three-week bear hunting expedition. Roosevelt stayed at the Hotel Colorado on multiple occasions after this.

According to the hotel, maids gave a stuffed bear pieced together with scraps of material to Theodore Roosevelt after an unsuccessful day of hunting to cheer him up. Later, when he did kill a bear, his teenage daughter Alice admired it saying, "I will call it Teddy."<ref>[http://hotelcolorado.com/history.html Hotel Colorado]</ref>

== Types of teddy bears ==
Commercially made, mass-produced teddy bears are predominantly made as toys for children. These bears have safety joints for attaching arms legs and heads. They must have securely fastened eyes that do not pose a choking hazard for small children. These "plush" bears must meet a rigid standard of construction in order to be marketed to children in the United States and in the European Union.

There are also companies that sell handmade collectible bears that can be purchased in stores or over the Internet. Some examples of such companies are Steiff.

Mohair, the fur shorn or combed from a breed of long haired goats, is woven into cloth, dyed and trimmed to produce a fascinating choice for any artist's palette. Alpaca teddy bears are made from the pelt of an alpaca because the fiber is too soft to weave. In addition to mohair and alpaca, there is a huge selection of "plush" or synthetic fur made for the teddy bear market. Both these types of fur are commercially produced.

Some teddy bear artists specialize in the production of bears made from recycled materials. These artists hunt thrift stores, flea markets, garage sales and trash collection centers as well as their own and their families' basements and attics in search of forgotten treasures to be turned into a collector's dream. Old quilts, dresses, fur collars, coats and stoles as well as beaded bags and garments are quickly transformed into stunning teddy bears.
