'''Pharr''' is a city in Hidalgo County, bridge to the Mexican city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas. It is part of the McAllen&ndash;Edinburg&ndash;Mission Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==About Pharr==
Pharr is located in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas, only minutes from the Mexico border.

Over the last 10 years, Pharr has experienced strong growth and economic development. Its population has steadily increased to over 60,000 people.

==Climate==
Pharr has a humid subtropical climate, similar to that of the Tampa Bay Area of Florida but with less precipitation and slightly higher summer maximum temperatures. The average high in January is 68 °F and the average low is 47 °F (8 °C). The average high is 96 °F (36 °C) and the average low is 74 °F (23 °C) in August. The warm season is long, as average high temperatures are above 90 °F (32 °C) and average low temperatures are above 70 °F (21 °C) from June through September.

Average annual precipitation is only 21.0 inches (532.4 mm). Most precipitation occurs in the warm season, with the least precipitation distinctly occurring in the cooler winter. As September is the peak of the North Atlantic Hurricane Season and tropical storms and hurricanes occasionally drop copious amounts of rainfall on the region, this month tends to be by far the wettest, averaging 3.6 inches (90.3 mm) of precipitation. The driest month is March, with only 0.7 inches (17.3 mm) of precipitation.

Despite frequent temperatures above 100 °F (38 °C), occasionally as early as February and as late the end of October, the highest temperature ever recorded in Pharr is only 110 °F (43 °C), once in 1998 and once in 1999. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Pharr is 13 °F (-11 °C), on January 12, 1962, which is far lower than would be expected at the same latitude in Florida or on the west coast of North America, due to its location in the middle of the continent.
