'''泰恩及威爾地鐵''' (Tyne & Wear Metro，區內居民常稱'''the Metro''') 是一個位於英格蘭東北部泰恩-威爾郡縣紐卡素、基斯黑德及新特蘭的輕鐵系統。系統在1980年開業。

==沿革==
本鐵路系統通常被描述為英國首個輕鐵系統。無論如何，它其實是一個混合型系統，展示輕軌和重型地下鐵的原素；長距高速的市郊鐵路和內城鐵路系統。

地鐵於1980年開始運作，但如香港的鐵路系統一樣，因鐵路地役權發展緩慢，導致連接紐卡素和基斯黑德的隧道需循序漸進的發展。<ref>[http://www.nexus.org.uk/wps/wcm/connect/Nexus/Nexus/Press+office/Transport+history/ Modern Rail Transportation] 2007年2月20日造訪</ref>
當中一部分的鐵路路線曾是世界上最先有市區鐵路系統的泰恩塞德電鐵 ( Tyneside Electrics，1904 ) 路線之一。
<ref>[http://www.nexus.org.uk/wps/wcm/connect/Nexus/Nexus/Press+office/Transport+history/ The Metro as the first public Rail Transportation] 2007年2月20日造訪</ref>本鐵路系統亦整齊地包含了世界其中二個的最舊的乘客鐵路系統，分別是：紐卡斯尔及北-{zh-hans:希尔茲; zh-tw:盾; zh-hk:舍士;}-鐵路(來往-{zh-hans:奇灵厄姆道; zh-hant:奇靈厄姆道; zh-hk:智靈咸道;}-和北-{zh-hans:希尔茲; zh-tw:盾; zh-hk:舍士;}-) (  )和布蘭德靈交匯處鐵路 (來往蓋茲海德和蒙克威茅-{zh-hans:斯; zh-hk:夫;}-，近光明球場 )( Brandling Juction Railway )，二條鐵路皆於1839年開始運作，令本鐵路系統成為世界上具爭議性的一條最舊的本地鐵路運輸系統之一。在奇徹斯特站， 一條已存在的煤礦鐵路被選為取代前乘客鐵路鋪排，因其穿過一些較多人居住的地區。

</ref> and is one of only two underground metro-type systems in the UK outside London, the other being the Glasgow Subway.

==Overview==
The Metro is usually described as Britain's first modern suburban and interurban railway systems. 

The Metro began operating in 1980, but was an evolutionary development, as it was a pioneering system in the use of existing rights-of-way to create a modern rail transit system,<ref>[http://www.nexus.org.uk/wps/wcm/connect/Nexus/Nexus/Press+office/Transport+history/ Modern Rail Transportation] Retrieved on Newcastle and urban railway systems, which opened in 1904 on public passenger lines that were then already well established (see Tyneside Electrics).<ref>[http://www.nexus.org.uk/wps/wcm/connect/Nexus/Nexus/Press+office/Transport+history/ The Metro as the first public Rail Transportation] Retrieved on 20 February 2007</ref> The Metro alignment comprises most of two of the world's oldest passenger railways, the Newcastle & North Shields Railway (Metro between Chillingham Road and North Shields) and the Brandling Junction Railway (between Gateshead and Monkwearmouth, near the Stadium of Light), both opened in 1839, making the Metro arguably one of the world's oldest local rail transport systems. In the case of Metro's Chichester station, the route of an existing mineral railway was chosen instead of the previous passenger railway alignment, as it passed through a more heavily populated area than the previous High Shields station, This is also the oldest section of the Metro route, dating back to 1834.

===Changes===
With the opening of the UK system to implement a form of the Pelaw and Sunderland.<ref>[http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/tyne/ Light Rail and Main Line rail combined] Retrieved on 20 February 2007</ref> The section from Sunderland to South Hylton was previously part of the Sunderland to Durham mainline, closed in the wake of the Beeching Axe in the 1960s, and was the second Metro segment to be built on a completely disused line, following on from the Newcastle International Airport extension, which was largely built on the former Ponteland branch line.<ref>[http://www.thetrams.co.uk/tyneandwear.php Extension to Newcastle Airport] Retrieved on 20 February 2007</ref>

When the Metro first opened, it was claimed to be part of the UK's first deregulation of bus routes in 1986. However, it is still possible to buy Transfare tickets that combine a Metro and bus journey.

===News and issues===
* The Metro has been the subject of criticism from environmental campaigners as it does not permit the carriage of standard bicycles, though there are now storage lockers for these at some stations. Only small folding bicycles are now permitted on the Metro.

* The Metro long had a problem with fare evasion on the system, due to the lack of ticket inspectors on the trains. In recent years, the number of inspectors has increased, and in 2005 the penalty fare for travelling without a valid ticket was increased from £10 to £20.<ref>[http://www.nexus.org.uk/wps/wcm/connect/Nexus/Nexus/Press+office/Media+briefing+notes/Nexus+-+Tyne+and+Wear+Metro Increase in T&W Metro fares] Retrieved on 20 February 2007</ref>

* A19 Holystone Interchange, and is located adjacent to existing track between Palmersville and Shiremoor on the northern loop section of the yellow line. It also acts as a feeder station for Nexus' R19 bus service, supporting Cobalt Park business park, the Silverlink Retail park, and North Shields.

* The ''"Stand clear of the doors please"'' announcement, which sounded before the doors started to close, was introduced in 1991. In 1996, a contest was held in which several mystery celebrities recorded the phrase, with a prize awarded for correct identification; these recordings were replaced by staff announcements after the contest ended. In order to increase the clarity of the announcement (especially for individuals not fluent in English) the phrase was replaced with "Doors closing" in 2004.

* In May 2007, an elderly woman on a mobility scooter entered the Metro on one side and crashed through the opposite doors falling onto the track.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/6686703.stm] Nexus stated that the doors had not been faulty and that this was the first occasion in 27 years that a set of doors had been forced open. There have since been two further incidents in similar circumstances and unaccompanied users of mobility scooters are no longer permitted on trains[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7407147.stm].

* On 17 October 2007 services were suspended between Benton and Shiremoor due to track subsidence to the east of Northumberland Park. This appears to have occurred due to the collapse of a disused mineshaft near the station with services suspended for a number of days for remedial work to make the area safe.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/7050363.stm Mine shaft collapse halts Metro] Retrieved on 18 October 2007</ref>

*The network's newest station, Simonside, opened on 17 March, 2008.

==Rolling stock==
The design of the Metrocars was partly derived from that of the German Stadtbahnwagen B, although the Metrocars were built by Metro-Cammell in Birmingham (now part of Alstom). Prior to opening, the Metro's two prototypes (numbered 4001 and 4002; they are still in service) underwent several years of testing at the Metro's own test track on North Tyneside, opened in 1975. The track was also used to test cars for the Hong Kong MTR, also built by Metro-Cammell. However, to accommodate the larger size of the Hong Kong cars, a short above ground test tunnel had to be demolished. The test track was built on the route of an old mineral wagonway, and it is now home to the Stephenson Railway Museum.

The Metro uses the line voltage of 1500 V DC, which was previously used on the Britain. Metro has a rated top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph), which it attains on the rural stretches of the line. The vehicles have a minimum turning radius of 50 metres (55 yds), although there are no curves this tight on the system, except for the non-passenger service chord between Manors and West Jesmond.

During the early years of Metro, cars were operated in single and double sets. As single set cars became overcrowded Nexus (operator of the system) resumed to using two cars as standard.<ref>[http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/tyne/ Usage of single and double cars] Retrieved on 20 February 2007</ref> Single sets are used today, but only to operate the new Sunday service. Single cars became common during construction of the Sunderland extension when some units were taken for testing of the new track.

==Route==
The Metro system currently consists of two lines:

* '''Green line''' - Newcastle Airport to South Hylton via Newcastle upon Tyne city centre, Gateshead, Sunderland city centre and continuing on to South Hylton.<ref>[http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/new/newcstle.htm Route of Green Line trains] Retrieved on 20 February 2007</ref>
* '''Yellow line''' - St James to South Shields via North Shields, Tynemouth, Whitley Bay, then looping back on itself and going south via the city centre again to Gateshead, the Jarrow and South Shields.<ref>[http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/new/newcstle.htm Route of the Green Line Trains] Retrieved on 20 February 2007</ref>

Originally there was also a Red line that ran between Pelaw and Benton, and a Blue line that ran between St James and peak hours to increase the service frequency at the busier stations; they also made sense in the context of the extensions that were mooted at the time the Metro was opened. Many of these additional services still operate today, but are now considered Yellow line services.

==Distances==
thumb|right|The blue plate on the electrification mast shows [[Howdon Metro station|Howdon to be at kilometre point BP 19.732.]]
Distances on the system are measured relative to a datum point at South Gosforth. The system is metric, with distances reported in km to the nearest m. Lines are designated as ''OUT'' and ''IN''. The ''IN'' line is the line from St. James to South Shields via the ''inside'' of the loop (yellow line). The ''OUT'' line is the line from South Shields to St. James via the ''outside'' of the loop. By extension the ''IN'' line is also the line from Airport to South Gosforth, and onwards from Pelaw to Sunderland and South Hylton. Distance plates are mounted on all overhead line structures and these are used for references. Different distances are normally quoted for stations, depending upon whether the direction of travel is ''IN'' or ''OUT''. Distances increase from the datum in all directions.<ref name="Maxey"></ref>

The Sunderland extension, being Network Rail owned, uses the miles and chains system. The boundary between systems close to Pelaw Metro Junction.<ref name="Quail2"></ref>

==Notable features==
thumb|right|250px|Wallsend station is probably the only station in Britain with signs in [[Latin.]]
* The Tyne and Wear Metro was the first railway in the metric system; all its speeds and distances are measured in metric units only. <!--The parliamentary bill that gave the go-ahead to construction was the first British law to be defined only in metric units. NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK THIS-->

* Smoking has been forbidden on the entire system since service began; this was one of the first comprehensive smoking bans.<ref>[http://www.nexus.org.uk/wps/wcm/connect/Nexus/Art+on+Transport/Commissions/Art+-+Pontis+(Wallsend) Smoking bans in Wallsend] Retrieved on February 20 2007</ref>

* A large-scale public artwork by Nayan Kulkarni, ''Nocturne'', consisting of a moving kaleidoscope of light travelling along the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge (which carries the Metro between Newcastle and Gateshead) was inaugurated in April 2007.

* Wallsend station is probably the only public facility in Britain in which the signage is in Roman heritage and its location near the Roman fort at the end of the wall. The project was part of Newcastle and Gateshead's unsuccessful joint bid to become European Capital of Culture in 2008.<ref>[http://www.nexus.org.uk/wps/wcm/connect/Nexus/Art+on+Transport/Commissions/Art+-+Pontis+(Wallsend) Michael Pinsky No smoking sign at Wallsend station] Retrieved on 20 February 2007</ref>

* Before tunnelling could begin, several disused mineshafts in Newcastle and Gateshead, some of them hundreds of years old, had to be completely filled in.

* Although the Metro opened in 1980, most of its route was previously part of one of the world's first electric suburban railways, which began service in 1904.
