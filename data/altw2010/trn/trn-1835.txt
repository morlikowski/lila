'''바톨로뮤 조조 심슨'''(Bartholomew Jo-Jo "Bart" Simpson)은 리사와 매기의 오빠로 나이는 10살로 설정되어 있다.

《The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album》(ISBN 0-06-096582-7)이란 책에 따르면, 그의 “생일”은 로스앤젤레스 올림픽 기간에 태어난 리사보다는 2년 38일 나이가 많다. 그리고 시리즈의 《I Married Marge》편에서, 호머와 마지가 《제국의 역습》을 본 직후 바트가 임신되었다는 내용이 나오기 때문에, 1980년 5월 하순에 임신되었다는 사실을 알 수 있다. 정확한 연도는 일관성이 있지 않으며 이는 바트가 시간이 지나도 항상 10살로 묘사되기 때문이다.

바트는 스케이트 보딩, 만화책 (특히 방사능맨), 동생들 놀래키기, 리사 도와주기 등에 흥미가 있는 것으로 그려진다. 이 시리즈의 다수의 캐릭터와 마찬가지로 바트는 왼손잡이이다.

<!--
Bart's interests include Dickensian chimney sweeps, mooning unsuspecting victims, and prank calling Moe Szyslak at his tavern.  Like many other characters on the show, Bart is also left-handed.

He is a self-proclaimed underachiever who begins each show in Springfield Elementary, his actions and speech frequently show considerable mental agility and understanding, and so he cannot be called "stupid" per se. Various explanations for his behavior include genetics (the male-linked 'Simpson Stupidity' gene), environment (watching and emulating Homer's bad examples), disinterest of his school's faculty, and a general dim view of authority. Although he frequently takes advantage of Homer, they share many of the same mannerism and behaviors.

Bart caused a fictional diplomatic incident between the that phenomenon, which amusingly popularized the legend even more.)

Many times, when Homer finds out that Bart has said or done something stupid or bad, he yells out, "Why you little&mdash;!" and strangles Bart in anger.

Bart Simpson and other characters from ''The Simpsons'' appeared in numerous television commercials for Nestl&eacute;'s Butterfinger candy bars from 1990 to 2001, with his catch-phrase and the slogan ''"Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!"''.  This was parodied when in an episode, Bart says that he doesn't remember being in a commercial, then he holds up a Butterfinger and eats it.

Bart speaks French fluently.  He also was able to speak Spanish briefly on a trip to Portuguese in Brazil.  He also once made an exchange with Homer in Japanese. Also in "Bart on the Road," he makes a delivery to Chinese (specifically, the variety of Cantonese spoken in the city). This may be inherited from Homer, who has also demonstrated advanced language abilities, including penguin.

Bart is allergic to butterscotch, imitation butterscotch, and cauliflower.

In a short scene set in the future Bart is shown to become a Supreme Court Justice. In another episode set entirely in the future he's a blue-collar worker like his father.

In an interview, Simpsons creator Matt Groening stated he chose the name as an  anagram of ''brat''.

In 1998, ''Time'' magazine selected Bart as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century&mdash;the only fictional character to make the list.

ISBN 0-00-638898-1</ref> is a character in the Nancy Cartwright<ref name="CompleteGuide"/>, and first appeared on the ''short "Homer and Lisa and Maggie.<ref name="CompleteGuide"/> Bart's most prominent character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness, disrespect for authority and sharp wit. During the first two seasons of ''The Simpsons'', Bart was the show's main character; while later episodes started to focus more on Homer, Bart remains one of the most enduring characters on the series, and has proven to be one of the most well-known characters in the history of American television animation.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"></ref>

==Personality==
Bart is a self-described underachiever and proud of it, and is considerably motivated in disrupting the routine at Springfield Elementary. His pranks are often elaborately complex, while his actions and speech frequently show considerable mental agility, street-smarts, and understanding. In "Separate Vocations" when Bart becomes hall monitor, his grades go up, showing that he only struggles because he does not pay attention, not because he is stupid. This is reinforced in the episode "Brother's Little Helper", in which it is revealed that Bart suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder. On the other hand, he often seems to have trouble understanding even the simplest concepts, such as the word "irony", what the equator is and that the logo on his globe, "Rand McNally," is not actually a country. The fact that he is the son of Homer Simpson and shares many of the same mannerisms and behaviors may also account for his antics. Homer even described Bart as "a younger, more in-your-face version" of himself. It is often joked that Bart is a pawn of the devil due to his mischievous behavior, such as when Lisa calls him "the Devil's cabana boy", a role which Bart seems to relish. In one Halloween episode, the Devil actually makes an appearance in the form of Ned Flanders, saying "Hey, Bart" like they are old friends.  

Although he gets into endless trouble and can be sadistic, shallow and selfish, Bart also exhibits many qualities of high integrity. He has, on a few occasions, helped the school Principal Seymour Skinner, and his teacher Edna Krabappel despite the fact he often terrorizes them, and he often befriends outcasts like Milhouse Van Houten. One great example of his quasi sense of honor is in the episode ''This Little Wiggy'' where Bart stands up for Ralph Wiggum at the cost of peer popularity. In addition Bart, almost invariably, has made amends with the person he has pranked by the end of an episode.

Due to Bart's mischievousness and Homer's often uncaring and incompetent behavior, the two have a turbulent relationship. Bart will often address Homer by his Marge, however, is much more caring, understanding and nurturing than Homer, but she also refers to Bart as "a handful" and is often embarrassed by his antics. Despite his attitude, Bart is sometimes willing to go through a series of humiliations if it means pleasing his mom.

Bart's appearance in the show rarely changes from episode-to-episode. He typically sports blue shorts and an orange t-shirt with blue sneakers with alittle white dot on the sides. Although his t-shirt color occasionally changes to light blue or red, a differing appearance is only seen in special occasions such as when the Simpsons go to church or when the episode takes place in the winter season.

Bart shares a sibling rivalry with his younger sister, Lisa, but has a buddy-like relationship with his youngest sister Maggie, due to her infant state. While Bart has often hurt Lisa out of jealousy, and even fought her physically, they are very close. Bart cares for Lisa as deeply as she does for him, and has always apologized for going too far. He also believes Lisa to be his superior when it comes to solving problems, and frequently goes to her for advice.  Despite his duties as a brother to torment his sister, Bart is also highly protective of Lisa, such as in Bart the General: when a bully destroys her box of cupcakes he immediately steps in with a 'that's my sister, man!' and proceeds to stand up against schoolyard-leviathan Nelson Muntz. This close relationship is also exhibited in Round Springfield; after the death of Lisa's hero Bleeding Gums Murphy, Bart uses his Krusty-Metal-O settlement money to buy her the only known copy of Murphy's album, because she was the only one who believed him when he said he was sick. The siblings have formed a dynamic crime-solving duo during many of their encounters with Sideshow Bob, Bart's nemesis.

Bart also has had numerous relationships, including one of Lisa's friends, Emily, who kissed Bart on a dare ("Flaming Moe's"), Reverend Lovejoy's daughter, Jessica Lovejoy ("Bart's Girlfriend"), Rainier Wolfcastle's daughter, Greta Wolfcastle ("The Bart Wants What it Wants"), a juvenial, Gina Vendetti ("The Wandering Juvie"), a girl from North Haverbrook, Darcy ("Little Big Girl"), an unnamed girl in ("The Monkey Suit"), and a girl in season nineteen's upcoming episode. Bart's first (and probably the greatest) love of his life was Laura Powers ("New Kid on the Block"), his next door neighbor and babysitter, with whom he shares a lot in common. But because she's a teenager and Bart is only 10, the two never have a relationship. In Another Simpsons Clip Show, Bart calls Laura "The only girl he ever loved", although this was set before the episodes featuring most of the other relationships.

Bart's interests include watching Radioactive Man'', watching Lisa, playing estranged father, and playing various pranks such as mooning unsuspecting people and prank calling Moe Szyslak at his tavern. His best friend is Milhouse van Houten. 

Bart sometimes demonstrates amazing linguistic abilities. Though he has not demonstrated the ability since the episode in which he learned, where he speaks near-perfect French. He also learned Spanish in a matter of hours in preparation for the family's trip to Brazil. Upon learning that Brazilians speak Portuguese and not Spanish, Homer tells his son to forget what he learned, prompting Bart to strike himself over the head with an airplane phone until he forgot the language. Bart also speaks Japanese, which he also learned in a couple of hours in prison along with Homer, and is also shown speaking Japanese in 'A Star is Burns', Cantonese and Latin. His advanced linguistic skills may be inherited from Homer, who also speaks advanced languages, including penguin. Bart can also drive, having his own driving license, given to him in "Little Big Girl" after saving Springfield from a fire, although he has been seen driving before, a la "Burns' Heir", and also with a fake license, particularly in the episode "Bart on the Road". He still possesses it, using it to great effect in "24 minutes", stealing Principal Skinner's car to get to Jimbo's house. He is allergic to real and imitation butterscotch, luminous monster make-up, cauliflower, and shrimp, the latter of which is possibly inherited from his mother. According to an interview, Bart has a fear of coffins. This fear may have started when, shopping for a coffin for the yet-living Grampa in the episode "Tennis the Menace", when Bart is accidentally shut in a coffin while fooling around. This fear is referred to in "Funeral for a Fiend", where Bart is nearly cremated while in a coffin. In the episode "The Boys of Bummer," it is revealed that Bart's favorite song is "Love Stinks" by The J. Geils Band.

In his book ''Planet Simpson'', Chris Turner describes Bart as a nihilist. Bart's character traits of rebelliousness and disrespect for authority has been likened to that of America's founding fathers, rendering him an updated version of American icons Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, rolled into one."<ref>Cantor, P: "The Simpsons: Atomistic Politics and the Nuclear Family", page 738.
