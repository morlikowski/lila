'''Peter Michael Falk''' (s. yhdysvaltalainen näyttelijä. Hän on ollut kahdesti Oscar-ehdokkaana parhaasta miessivuosasta: elokuvissa ''Murder Inc'' ja ''Pocketful of Miracles''.

Falkin vanhemmat olivat juutalaista syntyperää, isä venäläinen ja äiti puolalainen. Falk on ollut naimisissa näyttelijä Shera Danesen kanssa vuodesta 1977. Aiemman vaimonsa Alice Mayon (naimisissa 1960–1976) kanssa Falkilla on kaksi lasta.

Falk tunnetaan parhaiten roolistaan vuosikymmeniä jatkuneessa rikossarjassa ''Columbo'', jossa hän esittää nimiroolia sadetakkiin pukeutuvana etsivänä. Columbon lempimaneeri on lopettaa kuulustelu, tehdä lähtöä ja kääntyä sitten takaisin sanoen: "Just one more thing..." ("Ai niin, vielä yksi asia..."). Columbo esittää epäillyilleen usein hajamielistä ja unohtelevaa, mutta on kuitenkin nokkela ja kekseliäs. Roolistaan Columbona Falk on palkittu viidellä Emmy-patsaalla ja Golden Globella.

Falkilla on cameo-rooli Wim Wendersin elokuvassa Berliinin taivaan alla (1987, ''Der Himmel über Berlin'').

'''Peter Michael Falk''' (born American actor, best known for his role as Lt. Columbo in the television series ''Columbo''.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Italian community. His speaking of New York dialect and his famous role as Lt. Columbo has led some to think incorrectly that he is Italian-American. 

Falk attended CIA before becoming a management analyst with the Connecticut State Budget Bureau in Hartford.

===Acting===
After deciding to be an actor and studying at the White Barn Theatre in Broadway debut playing an English soldier in Shaw's Saint Joan with Academy Award twice, for ''Murder, Inc.'', and ''Pocketful of Miracles''.

Falk played a cab driver in the all-star comedy film ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World''. He also specialized in comical crooks, as in 1964's Rat Pack crime spoof ''Robin and the 7 Hoods'' and the 1965 farce ''The Great Race'' with Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis.

====''Columbo''====
thumb|200px|right|[[Patrick McGoohan and Peter Falk]]Falk is best known for the title role in the long-running TV series ''Columbo'', a shabby and ostensibly absent-minded police detective. In reality, Columbo possesses a keen mind and invariably solves his cases by paying close attention to tiny inconsistencies in a suspect's story, hounding them until they confess; he merely puts on a good show of being dim-witted so that the criminals and even his colleagues will be more at ease around him. Columbo's signature technique is to exit the scene of an interview, only to stop in the doorway to ask a suspect "just one more thing" (the title of Falk's recent memoir), which often brings to light the key inconsistency. The role won Falk four Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe. Four of Columbo's cases gave Falk the chance to work with his longtime friend, Patrick McGoohan, the latter playing the villain of the episodes.

The actor played the detective over a 35-year span, beginning with the film ''Prescription: Murder'' in 1968.

====Subsequent work====
Falk was a close friend of independent film director Husbands'', ''A Woman Under the Influence'', and a cameo appearance at the end of ''Opening Night''. Cassavetes in turn guest-starred in the ''Columbo'' episode "Étude in Black" (1972).

Falk continued to work in films, including his performance as a possible ex-CIA agent of dubious sanity in the The In-Laws''. He also appeared in ''The Princess Bride'' and in Wim Wenders' ''Wings of Desire'' (cast as himself).

In 1998, Falk returned to the New York stage to star in an off-Broadway production of Arthur Miller's ''Mr. Peters' Connections''. His previous stage work included the shady real-estate salesman, Shelley "the Machine" Levine, in a Los Angeles production of David Mamet's prize-winning "Glengarry Glen Ross."

Falk had a brief appearance in the 2007 Next''.
