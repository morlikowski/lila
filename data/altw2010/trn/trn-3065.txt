'''''Disturbia''''' is a 2007 thriller starring Shia LaBeouf as a teenager who thinks he witnesses a murder while spying on his suspicious neighbor while being placed under house arrest.

==Plot==
Kale Brecht (Spanish teacher, Señor Gutierrez (Rene Rivera). When the teacher asks Kale what his father would think if he could see him now, Kale punches him in the face. For this assault, he is sentenced to a three-month house arrest period during his Summer vacation with an ankle monitor and a proximity sensor, which prohibit him from roaming beyond the boundaries of his lawn. He learns that one of the police officers monitoring him is the teacher's cousin (Jose Pablo Cantillo), who delights in humiliating Kale, such as one occasion where he accidentally goes past the limits of the yard while chasing some neighborhood pranksters.

His mother, Julie Brecht (David Morse), who returns home in a 1960's era stake out.

Ronnie and Ashley dismiss Kale's suspicions initially, regarding them circumstantial coincidences. But they become more involved when Kale observes a woman Turner had picked up from a nightclub trying to escape the house in a panicked state before being apparently killed by Turner. Later on, he sees what looks to be the same woman leaving the house and driving off.

Later on, Ashley tells Kale that she is throwing a party with the popular individuals of their school, much to Kale's dismay, both because of his incarceration and his dislike of those individuals. When Kale discovers a jock physically flirting with a permissive Ashley in full view of him, he becomes consumed with jealousy. Assembling various household stereo equipment, he proceeds to crash the party by playing obnoxious music at extreme volume to the unsuspecting party guests. Ashley, furious at Kale's interruption, enters his house through a window, angrily confronting him about his voyeurism. Taken aback by the challenge, he admits to watching her because she is unlike other girls in that she is not self-centered, and in his words, is "looking at the whole world", unlike himself, who "can only see her". Ashley smartly remarks that the statement is both incredibly romantic while at the same time unsettling, before kissing Kale on the balcony of his home. As the two move to Kale's bed, Turner is shown killing a woman and moving her body outside the house, an action that creates noise that startles Ashley and Kale.

Days later, Kale insists that Ronnie break into Turner's car to get his garage door opener to continue investigating. Ashley goes to the supermarket to monitor Turner while Ronnie retrieves the door opener from his car, Ashley loses sight of Turner when bumping into a classmate, once realizing Turner is on his way home she calls Kale to alert him, She hops in her car to leave the parking lot, as she's leaving she's startled by Turner who appears in front of her car, he confronts her and it's revealed that he knows about Kale and herself spying on him, Turner leaves Ashleys car after telling her "I like my privacy, maybe you should pass it on". Just in time before Turner returns home, Ronnie retrieves the garage door opener code accidentally leaving behind his cell phone. That night, when Ronnie discovers his mistake, he re-enters the garage in an attempt to get it back. Inside the garage, he discovers a foul-smelling object wrapped in a garbage bag. As he attempts a more detailed inspection of the contents, the garage door is suddenly shut and Ronnie hides in the house while Kale attempts to rescue him, in the process alerting the police to the breach of his house arrest. After the police arrive they search the house and discover that Ronnie is nowhere inside and that the bag in the garage contains the remains of a deer that Turner hit on the interstate. Kale fears Ronnie has been discovered or worse, when he receives an SMS telling him to check his video monitor, the camera comes back on, revealing Ronnie, who seems to be dead. Worried, Kale walks over to his closet and opens the door, only to see Ronnie laying motion-less, Ronnie then suddendly scares Kale, revealing he was playing a joke on him. Kale then screams at Ronnie stating "You don't know what I went through searching for you!".

Kale's mother goes across the street to talk to Turner, in hopes avoiding criminal charges. While she is there, Kale watches the tape Ronnie recorded during his escape from Turner's house, as he's watching he notices something hidden behind an air vent that Ronnie accidentally filmed when he dropped the camera, he zooms in a few times only to reveal the object was the face of a dead woman. At the same time Kale realizes what he saw, Kale's mother, unbeknownst to him, is suddenly attacked by Turner and taken into the depths of the home. In shock, Kale calls out to Ronnie who is downstairs at the time.

Turner quietly breaks into Kale's living room, ambushes Ronnie,and strikes him with an aluminum baseball bat, knocking him unconscious. Kale, still viewing the video on his computer, sees a reflection of Turner on his monitor, narrowly dodging the man's strike. The two struggle for several minutes, with Kale nearly escaping from his home before being caught by Turner at the boundary line. Turner knocks Kale unconscious and carries him, bound by duct tape, to the boy's room. Turner reveals to a now-awake Kale that he plans on framing Kale for the murders of both Ronnie and his mother, using his father's death and police records as proof. Kale is then forced to write a suicide note to Ashley explaining his supposed actions, when Ashley enters the home from downstairs. Turner is distracted by the noise, giving Kale an opportunity to strike Turner, who is knocked off balance. Kale then rushes downstairs to a surprised Ashley, who promptly unties him.

Turner then attacks the pair, eventually driving them over a roof and into Ashley's pool. Kale orders Ashley to get the police, while Kale returns to Turner's home to rescue his mother. His monitoring officer, eager to humiliate Kale, arrives at the house only to be killed by Turner. Kale then stumbles upon an operating room with a wig which Turner uses to stage his victim leaving the house and a woman's driver's license, the same woman that Turner had killed earlier. He then discovers a secret passageway to the home's foundation, decorated with paraphernalia from Turner's previous victims. 

He suddenly falls through a crack through the floor, splashing down in a murky pool filled with human remains. Although he is initially terrified, Kale comes to his senses, attempting to find a way out when he hears a low whimpering. He climbs out of the pool and staggers over to a wall and finds his mother, restrained but unharmed. The two are then viciously attacked by Turner, who appears from the shadows. Amidst an intense but brief struggle in the darkness, Kale impales Turner with a pair of garden shears pushing him into the water hole, killing him. 

Several minutes later, Kale and his mother are seen emerging from the garage of Turner's home amidst a battery of police officers. Afterwards, his monitoring device is taken off by a grateful police department, and he promptly exercises his new freedom by stepping out of his yard and passionately kissing Ashley. The two then get revenge on the neighborhood pranksters by calling their parents, pretending to be the one of the cable subscription staff enquiring about the bill for their covert viewing of adult movies channel. Confused their mother walks into their room to see them watching an adult film. Satisfied Kale and Ashley are then shown kissing on Kale's couch when Ronnie, revealed to be safe, starts recording the scene on video, stating that it will be the number one video on YouTube, a statement that is answered by Kale's raised middle finger.
