==Career==
Nealon debuted on network television doing a stand-up routine for ''The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'' in 1984.  In 1986, Saturday Night Live recruited his friend Dana Carvey, and Carvey in turn recommended Nealon.  Both joined the cast that year, and Nealon became a full-time performer in the 1987-1988 season, and remained for nine seasons.

Nealon's SNL characters include Mr. Subliminal (or Subliminal Message Man), "Franz" (of Hans and Franz) along with Dana Carvey, Mr. No Depth Perception, the anchor of Weekend Update (where his catchphrase was "That's news to me"), and many others. Nealon imbued all these characters with a characteristic deadpan delivery.

In 1991, he starred in the holiday movie, ''All I Want for Christmas''. More recently Nealon has appeared in the movies ''Little Nicky'', ''Daddy Day Care'', ''Good Boy!'' and ''Grandma's Boy''. In fall 2005, he appeared in an episode of ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'', where he played himself (Season 5, Episode 4).

Nealon had a recurring television role on the 2002-06 CBS comedy ''Still Standing'' playing Ted Halverson, the Millers' competitive and religious neighbor. He has also appeared as a patient in a mental institution on the first season of ''Monk''. "Deja Vu" is an episode of The Outer Limits television show. It first aired on 9 July 1999, during the fifth season. Nealon played Dr. Mark Crest. Nealon has an ongoing supporting role as Doug Wilson on the show "Weeds" on Showtime.

On a 1985 syndicated episode of the game show ''Sale of the Century'', a relatively unknown Nealon is spotted as one of the friends congratulating and celebrating with champion Tim Holleran, who won everything on stage to win $166,875, including $90,000 in cash. Nealon will also be playing Stuart Pearson in the new adventure, comedy movie They Came from Upstairs. Shooting has started in Auckland, New Zealand.

In 2008, a book authored by Nealon chronicling his experiences during his wife's pregnancy called ''Yes, You're Pregnant, But What About Me?'' was released.
