== Background and production ==
When Nat and Alex were young, one day they announced, "We're the Naked Brothers Band!" while dancing naked around their apartment after a bath.<ref name=timdraper/> They formed a band in preschool with Nat's best friends.<ref name=timdraper/>

In real life, Alex was taught to play drums by watching tapes of Ringo Starr, and Nat's favorite band is the Beatles. The influence is apparent in much of the band’s music. Alex's favorite artists include David Bowie and Fall Out Boy, and he appears in the video for Fall Out Boy's "The Take Over, The Break's Over." 

The brothers' real-life mother, Polly Draper (best known for her role as Ellyn Warren on the 1987–1991 hit ABC drama series ''thirtysomething''), is the director, creator, and executive producer of the TV show and their father, Michael Wolff (who was the band-leader and musical director of ''The Arsenio Hall Show'' from 1989 to 1994), is the co-executive producer and music supervisor of the show. Wolff stars as the brothers' geeky father, who plays the accordion and acts like a kid.<ref name=TVFamily/><ref name=timdraper/>

This is Draper's first time directing; her first time screenwriting was in 1999 with ''The Tic Code''. The film was both informed by Wolff's struggles with Tourette's syndrome and his love for the jazz piano.<ref name=TVFamily/>

Tom Ascheim said,<ref name=nakedbros>http://www.tourettetexas.org/PublicDocs/nakedbros.htm</ref>

The executive vice president and general manager of Nickelodeon said,<ref name=TVFamily/>

An executive producer of the series said he thought the brothers would be big when he watched ''The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie'' at the Hamptons International Film Festival:

Their online videos have been played by fans more than 11 million times as of October 2006. Two months later, one of those watchers recognized Nat and Alex in a Florida hotel. She sent them a note, "“Are you the Naked Brothers?’ They were so excited,” Ms. Draper said. "The show hasn't even aired yet and now walking down the streets kids are calling out their names. They can't believe it."<ref name=nakedbros/>

'''The Naked Brothers Band''' ist eine amerikanische Dokumentationsserie über eine Kinder-Rockband. Sie wurde nach dem gleichnamigen Film produziert. In Amerika startete sie am 3. Februar 2007, in Nick sehen.

== Handlung ==

In der Serie geht es um die Naked Brothers Band, besonders allerdings um die beiden Brüder Alex und Nat Wolff. Außerdem in der Band sind Thomas Batuello am Cello, David Levi am Keyboard, Qaasim Middleton an der E-Gitarre und Rosalina am Bass. Und nicht zu vergessen der Band Manager Cooper Pillot und die Cousine und Babysitterin von Nat und Alex und Background Tänzerin Jesse. Nat ist heimlich in Rosalina verliebt und versucht immer wieder ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf sich zu ziehen und sie für sich zu gewinnen. In der Serie geht es einfach um das Leben kleiner Rockstars die mit Star-Problemen aber auch mit den normalen Tücken des alltags konfrontiert werden, diese aber eigentlich immer sehr gut lösen.

Eine Kinderband zwischen Ruhm und normalem Alltag. Die Serie begleitet die beiden bei ihren Proben, Konzerten, Interviews und zeigt sie mit ihren äußerst prominenten Fans u.&nbsp;a. Uma Thurman, Julien Moore und Cyndi Lauper, die es sich nicht nehmen lassen einen Plausch mit den kessen Jungs abzuhalten. Dabei bekommt der Zuschauer auch Einblicke in Nat und Alex' Privatleben.

Die Brüder könnten charakterlich nicht unterschiedlicher sein. Der verträumte, sensible Sänger und Songwriter Nat und der Schlagzeuger Alex, sein energisch, unverfrorener, aber auch liebenswerter Bruder. Die Kamera fängt das Leben der berühmten Jungs auf und hinter der Bühne ein. Ebenso dabei sind die realen Freunde und Bandmitglieder von Nat und Alex. Der Cellospieler Thomas, der Keyboarder David, Gitarrist Qaasim und die Bassistin Rosalina, in die Nat verliebt ist. Der Bandmanager Cooper und Jesse, die Cousine der beiden Brüder, vervollständigen die lebhafte Truppe. 'The Naked Brothers Band- Junge Rockstars privat' zeigt den Ruhm eines Rockstars aber auch die Schattenseiten, die er mit sich bringen kann.
