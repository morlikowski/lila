'''Fiction Factory''' were a British band from Perth, Scotland, formed in the mid-1980s.

==Band line-up==
*Kevin Patterson: vocals
*Chic Medley: guitars
*Graham McGregor: bass
*Eddie Jordan: keyboards (replaced by Paul Wishart for the 2nd album)
*Mike Ogletree : drums and percussion

==History==
Before they started their project Fiction Factory, Kevin Patterson (vocals), Eddie Jordan (keyboard) and Chic Medley (guitar) were playing in a band called The RB's, a skinhead ska band based in Perth, Scotland. After they left that band, they wanted to keep writing songs but were fed-up with live performances (the RB's were one of the most prolific live performers in Scotland at that time). With no name for this project, the first song Kevin and Eddie wrote for it was "(Feels Like) Heaven" - the eventual 1984 UK top 10 hit - in the space of roughly half a day. 

From a list of names that Chic had drawn up, Fiction Factory was chosen: firstly, because of the perceived falseness of the music scene and its reliance on pretty faces (which the three lads definitely didn't possess), the project was originally going to be fronted by nice-looking people who had nothing to do with the songwriting or performance of the music; secondly, the hope was that they would write music for themselves, other artists and maybe even films. They were contacted by CBS Records and, after protracted procrastination by the label over a period of two years, got a contract with them. 

It should be mentioned that this was not before Kevin, Eddie and Chic were forced to create yet another live band with Graham McGregor (bass) and Mike Ogletree (drums and percussion) - a former drummer of the band Simple Minds - to prove to CBS that they were able to play live. <ref name="Fiction"></ref>

==Discography==
They had two hits in the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 6 in 1984 with "(Feels Like) Heaven". It was also a No. 1 in Switzerland. Follow up single "Ghost of Love" reached number 64 in the UK the same year. The band released an album ''Throw the Warped Wheel Out'', also in 1984. Dropped by CBS in that year, they signed to the independent Foundry Records and released "Another Story" in 1985.
