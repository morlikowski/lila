'''智利國家足球隊'''乃屬於智利國家級的足球代表隊，由智利足總管理。

因為地理和歷史因素，南美國家足球界一直都是由巴西和阿根廷所支配，而智利成績亦一直平平。單在世界杯，只有在1962年在智利本土舉行的比賽中贏得季軍。餘者都在小组赛出局。1994年更被國際足協禁止參加任何國際賽。森莫蘭奴和沙拉斯的'''双萨组合'''壓陣，闖入16强，但是被实力强大的卫冕冠军巴西所淘汰。

==History==
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: logo|120px|thumb|left|Federación de Fútbol de Chile -->
The Federación de Fútbol de Chile is the second oldest South American federation, with 113 years of existence. Its foundation dates back to June 19, 1895 in the port city of Valparaiso. Its first President was David Scott.<ref>[http://www.conmebol.com/federaciones_pais_index.jsp?pais=chi&slangab=E Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Chile is one of the four founding member nations of CONMEBOL which include Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. The members established the South American footballing organization on July 9, 1916.<ref>[http://conmebol.com/federaciones_pais_index.jsp?pais=chi&slangab=E Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The four associations enacted and  participated in the first held South American Championship which would later be re-named the Copa America. 

The first official use of a bicycle kick was performed in a CONMEBOL Copa America match between Chile and Argentina gaining footballing notoriety and international appeal. The journalists who had witnessed the event had labeled the move la Chilena.<ref> http://www.euskonews.com/0332zbk/kosmo33201.html</ref> The attributed move has made a worldwide appearance and is labeled differently in other parts of the globe. In Copa America play, Chile has reached four finals but has lost in each appearance. 

Chile is one of the original thirteen national teams that competed in the inaugural 1930 World Cup. They started off well beating Mexico and France without conceding a goal. A 3-1 loss to Argentina in their final game left them in second place within the group, eliminating them from the tournament. In the 1950 World Cup, Chile was eliminated in the first round but defeated the United States 5-2.

Their best World Cup result was a third place finish in 1962, when Chile was the host nation. Chile lost 4-2 to eventual champions Brazil in a semifinals match. Chile went on to defeat Yugoslavia 1-0 in the third place match. 

Many historical incidences have occurred while Chile has been involved in World Cup competition. The first player to miss a World Cup penalty kick was France.<ref> http://revista.guachacas.cl/Epi_mundial30.html</ref> Carlos Caszely of Chile became the first player to be officially sent off with a red card in a 1974 World Cup game, during their match against West Germany. Red cards were formally introduced in World Cup play in 1970, but no players were sent off in that tournament.

In Olympic tournament play, Chile's best result was the Bronze medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, with striker Ivan Zamorano the competition's top scorer.

Chile has attained medals in both the U-17 World Cup held in Japan and the U-20 World Cup in [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup|
Canada]].

Notable past Chilean players include Guillermo Subiabre, Sergio Livingstone, George Robledo, Leonel Sánchez, Luis Eyzaguirre, Carlos Campos, Elías Figueroa, Carlos Caszely, Patricio Yáñez, and Ivan Zamorano.

==National Team World Cup History==
====Chile at the 1930 World Cup====

At the first ever Uruguay 1930, Chile was to be among the first of thirteen nations invited to participate in the inaugural tournament.<ref>http://revista.guachacas.cl/Epi_mundial30.html</ref>

The manager in charge of the Chilean national team was the young Hungarian Argentina, Mexico, and France.

Chile had an impressive start defeating the Mexican national team by a score of 3-0 on July 16, then beating France 1-0 on July 19.  Sharing the same amount of points, the decisive game was against the neighboring country of Argentina.  The game was played on July 22 at the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, Uruguay.  The game ended 3-1 in Argentina's favor, and the scoreline prevented Chile from qualifying onto the second round.

====The 1950 World Cup====

The 1950 edition of the Fifa World Cup was held in the South American country of Brazil. The Chilean national team manager at the tournament was Alberto Bucciardi, while the team captain was the starting goal keeper Sergio Livingstone. "La Roja" were located in group 2 and Chile eventually lost their first two games against Spain and England by the similar score of 2-0.  The last match was played with the United States where Chile went on to win by a score of 5-2, even though it was not to be enough for Chile in advancing onto the next round of the tournament.

====Chile and the World Cup of 1962====

300px|thumb|right|Chile national team in 1962
The 1962 World Cup in Chile was to be the third World Cup hosted on South American soil.
In 1960 the Great Chilean Earthquake would strike the country with the highest recorded magnitude in world history of 9.5 on the Richter scale.<ref>U.S. Geological Survey (March 7, 2006).  [http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/events/1960_05_22.php Historic Earthquakes - Chile - 1960 May 22 19:11:14 UTC - Magnitude 9.5: The Largest Earthquake in the World.] Retrieved on 2007-01-09</ref> Despite the natural disaster plans went as followed for Chile to be the host nation of this World Cup tournament. 

The host country won their first match against Switzerland by 3-1. The second match against Italy (2-0) became known as the Battle of Santiago. Although only two players were sent off by the English referee Ken Aston, the match saw repeated, deliberate attempts from players on both sides to harm opponents, and the teams needed police protection to leave the field in safety. Years later Ken Aston went on to invent the yellow and red cards used in football.<ref>http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/refereeing/news/newsid=80623.html</ref>

Later surprisingly, Chile defeated European champions USSR that included World Champions Brazil but a capacity crowd of 76,600 watched Brazil beat the hosts 4-2. This game saw Yugoslavia in the playoff. 

The team is said to have eaten Swiss cheese before beating Switzerland, spaghetti before beating Italy, and drank vodka before beating the USSR. They also drank coffee before the match against Brazil, although they did not win that match. This has been Chile's best performance in a World Cup.<ref>http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/comment/story/0,,1807018,00.html</ref>

====The World Cup of 1966====

England was the stage for the eighth World Cup. It was also to be the first European World Cup that Chile would participate in. Qualifying for the 1966 edition ended with a play-off between Ecuador in Lima, Peru on the 12th of October 1965.  The current Chilean manager at the time Francisco Hormazabal decided to resign from that position.  Chile immediately needed a replacement, and Luis Alamos would take the reins of the national team.  The match against Ecuador finished 2-1 in Chile's favor, both goals scored by Leonel Sanchez and Ruben Marcos, and the result secured Chile's World Cup berth.  

Chile was unable to repeat the same success found in the previous World Cup of 1962. Among the nations congregated in group 4 which included the Soviet Union, Italy, and North Korea, Chile was only able to gain 1 point with a 1-1 draw against North Korea. Chile scored two goals in the 1966 World Cup both coming from Ruben Marcos.

====Chile at the 1974 World Cup====

Chile qualified for Deutschland 74 after a controversial play-off with the USSR. Following a drawn first leg in Moscow, the Soviets refused to play the second leg at the Estadio Nacional in Santiago, which had been used as a concentration camp by the military dictatorship of Pinochet. However, FIFA refused to switch the match to a neutral venue, and the Soviets refused to fly to Santiago. The Chilean players kicked off on an otherwise empty pitch, scored into the unguarded USSR net, and because there was no opposition to restart the game, the referee awarded the match to Chile, ensuring they qualified for the 1974 finals.

At the tournament itself, Chile lost their opening game 1-0 to West Germany in Berlin, thanks to a long-range shot from Paul Breitner. Striker Carlos Caszely was controversially sent off in the second half.

Guided by coach East Germany, again in Berlin. Martin Hoffmann put the GDR ahead, but Australia, which eliminated both teams.

====Chile at the 1982 World Cup====

At España 82, the Chileans performed poorly with an ageing team in which Austria in Oviedo, Walter Schachner scoring the only goal midway through the first half. Caszely missed a penalty soon afterwards.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/results/matches/match=764/report.html FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Chile were then beaten 4-1 in Gijón by a West Germany, with goalkeeper Algeria, Chile were overrun in the first half and went in at half-time 3-0 behind, but managed to save some face with second-half goals from Miguel Neira and Juan Carlos Letelier. <ref>[http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/results/matches/match=813/report.html FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <ref>[http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/results/matches/match=740/report.html FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

====Disqualification and Banishment from the 1990 & 1994 World Cups====
''La Roja's'' most infamous moment known as '''The Roberto Rojas Scandal''' came on Maracanã stadium, Brazil led Chile 1-0. A defeat for Chile would eliminate them from the tournament. Around the 67-minute mark, Chilean goalkeeper Roberto "Cóndor" Rojas fell to the pitch with an apparent injury to his forehead. A firework, thrown from the stands by a Brazilian fan named Rosemary de Mello, was smouldering about a yard away. After carrying Rojas off the pitch, the Chilean players and coaches refused to return claiming conditions were not safe. The match went unfinished.

After studying video footage of the match showing that the firework had not made contact with Rojas, FIFA awarded Brazil a 2-0 win (eliminating Chile from the 1990 World Cup). The team was banned from the qualifiers of the 1994 Football World Cup, and Rojas was banned for life<ref>[http://china.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=400545 Goal.com - Editorial/Comment - Own Goal: Faking Being Hit By Objects<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (although an amnesty was granted in 2001).
