'''Ancient Libya''' was the region west of the Nile Valley. It corresponds to what is now generally called Northwest Africa.  Its people were the ancestors of the modern Berbers.<ref>[http://www.mondeberbere.com/histoire/camps/origines.htm Gabriel Camps, L'origin des berbères]</ref>

In the Greek period the Berbers were known as "Libyans"<ref>Brian M. Fagan, Roland Oliver, Africa in the Iron Age: C. 500 B.C. to A.D. 1400 p. 47</ref> and their lands called "Libya" extended from modern Morocco to the western borders of ancient Egypt.  Modern Egypt contains the Siwa Oasis, historically part of Libya, where the Berber Siwi language is still spoken.

== The etymologic origin ==
The name ''Libya'' is found in the Ancient Egyptian, Phoenician, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Arabic and the modern European languages.<ref>[http://tawalt.com/monthly/libya/libya_this_name_in_history_1.pdfMohammed Moustapha Bazam, Libya: This name in its historic roots]  (This source will be referred to as "Moustapha Bazma")</ref>

=== The Egyptians ===
The Ancient Egyptians mentioned many Libyan tribes.  The most known tribes on the basis of the Egyptian Archaeologic sources are respectively: the Tjehenu, the Tamahu, the Libu (or Ribu),and the Meshwesh.  Those tribes were the most important Libyan tribes in the Egyptian sources.  However, other less important tribes (or minor groups) were mentioned in the Egyptian sources, too.

The oldest reference to this name goes back to Ramses II and Merneptah the Egyptian ruler of the 19th dynasty.  He ruled in the second half of the 13th century BCE.  The name was firstly mentioned as an ethnic name on ''the Merneptah Stele'' which is also known as the ''Israel's Stele'':
<blockquote>[..]The vile chief of the '''Libu'''<ref>There were no vowels in the Egyptian script.  The name Libu is written as ''LBW'' or ''RBW'' in the Egyptian hiergolyph.</ref> who fled under cover of night alone without a feather on his head, his feet unshod, his wives seized before his very eyes, the meal for his food taken away, and without water in the water-skin to keep him alive; the faces of his brothers are savage to kill him, his captains fighting one against the other, their camps burnt and made into ashes ...<ref>After Gardiner 1964, 273, from the Stele of Merenptah.</ref></blockquote>

Afterwards, the name appeared repeatedly in the pharaonic records.  It is, therefore, supposed that the origin of the name "Libya" would be this Egyptian name for the ancient tribe ''Greeks of Cyrenaica who may have co-existed with them.<ref> Clark Desmond J., Oliver Roland, Sanderson G. N., Roberts A. D.,  Donnelly Fage John, Gray Richard, Flint John, Crowder Michael  ''The Cambridge History of North Africa'' 1975 p. 141.</ref> 
Later, the name appeared in the Hebrew language written in the Bible as '''Lehabim''' and '''Lubim''' indicating the ethnic population and the geographic territory as well.

=== Neo-punic ===
In the neo-feminine noun of ''Libyan''.  The name was supposedly used as an ethnic name in those inscriptions.

=== Greeks ===
The first reference to "Libya" in the Greek language is found in Homer's Odyssey (IX.95; XXIII.311).  The name was used by Homer in a geographic sense, while he called its inhabitants ''Lotophagi'' meaning the "Lotus-eaters". After Homer, the name was used by Aeschylus, Pindar and other Ancient Greek writers.

Herodotus used '''Libuwa''' indicating Libya while he called the Libyans '''Libyes''' in the Greek language.  From his point of view, Libya was the name of the African continent, while "the Libyans" were the light-skinned North Africans, whereas the southern Africans were known as "the Ethiopians" to him.<ref>The Campridge History of North Africa, p. 141.</ref>

=== Romans ===
In Romans would have known them before their colonization of North Africa, because of the Libyan role in the Punic wars against the Romans.  The Romans used the name '''Libyes''', but it referred only to Barca and the Western desert of Egypt.  The other Libyan territories became known as ''Africa''.

=== Arabic derivation ===
In the Arabic literature, "Libya" was called '''Lubya''' indictating a speculative territory in west of Egypt. However, today, it is referred to as '''Libya'''.

=== Berber link questioned ===
It has been questioned whether the name ''Libu'' was an Egyptian name for an ancient Berber tribe or if it was the name the Berber tribe would use to refer to themselves.  After that time, the Ancient Egyptians may then have adopted it as a name for them.  An example of the first probability is the name ''Berber'' which is used to refer to the indigenous people of Northwest Africa, whereas they call themselves "Imazighen".

In fact, it is a difficult issue as the Berbers and the Ancient Libyans did not leave significant written sources. However, some prominent historians tried to trace the name to a Berber origin.  The supporters of the Berber origin believe that the name was related to an ancient Berber tribe.  The name ''Libu'' would have known many evolution from "Lebu" to "Libya" to "Lebata" to "Levata" to "Lvata" to "Lwatae".

Lwatae, the tribe of Maures.

Ibn Khaldun reports in the ''The History of Ibn Khaldun'' that Luwa was an ancestor of this previous tribe.  He stated that the Berbers add an "A" and "T" to the name for the plural forms. Subsquently, it became ''Lwat''. 

Conversely, the Arabs adopted the name as a singular form adding a "H" for the plural form in Arabic.  Ibn Khaldun goes furthermore denying the claim of Ibn Hazam who maybe singifically claimed on the basis of the Berber sources that Lwatah in addition to Sadrata and Mzata were from the ''Qibts'' (Egyptians).  According to Ibn Khaldun his claim is incorrect because Ibn Hazam had not read the books of the Berber scholars.<ref>[http://www.al-eman.com/islamlib/viewchp.asp?BID=163&CID=184 The History of Ibn Khaldun, the thirth chapter p. 184-258]</ref>

Oric Bates is a historians who considers that the name ''Libu'' or ''LBW'' would be derived from the name ''Luwatah''<ref>Bates Oric, ''The Eastern Libyans'' pg 57</ref> whilst the name Liwata is a derivation of the name Libu. Other historians like the Libyan historian Mohammed Moustapha Bazam tend to confirm this theory.

== Evidence ==
Compared with the History of Egypt, there is a little known on the History of Libya as there are few written texts.

Avant d'être désignés par « Berbères » ou « Imazighen », ce peuple étaient connu sous différents noms durant différentes époques<ref> - [http://www.usd.edu/~clehmann/pir/berbers.htm University of South Dakota] ''The Berbers''</ref>.

La plus ancienne référence retrouvée aux anciens Berbères nous vient de la Caire. Cette palette est considérée comme la plus ancienne source mentionnant les Berbères.

La seconde source est connu sous le nom de ''Palette de Narmer''. Cette palette est plus récente que la première, et on y voit les Tjehenu (tribu Libyenne) prisonniers.

Une autre tribu connu sous le nom de ''Tjemehu'' a été mentionné pour la première fois durant le règne du premier roi de la VIe dynastie égyptienne. Selon Oric Bates, le blondisme était courant chez les membres de cette tribu.
