=== Історія ===
Острів, на якому розташоване місто, було відкрито французом Жаком Карть'є у 1535 році. Він називає гору у центрі остріва ''Монреалем'', на честь короля Франції (старою французькою ''Mont réal'' = ''Королевська гора''). У той час, на острові вже існує індіанське село Ошлага (Hochelaga) (зараз так назвається один з районів міста Монреаль).

Місто Монреаль засновано 17 травня 1642 року. Напочатку воно носило назву '''Віль-Марі''' (Ville-Marie). Його засновником був Поль де Шомеді де Мезоньовь (Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve).

Місто планувалося як «зразкове християнське поселення». Головною метою засновників була християнізація індіанців. Але дуже швидко Віль-Марі перетворилося на сучасне поселення.

''Жанна Манс'' (Jeanne Mance)&nbsp;— одна з перших колоністок&nbsp;— засновує у місті лікарню.

Після тривалих війн, у 1701 році було укладено ''Великий Монреальський мир'' з індіанцями.

У 1760 році Монреаль захоплено англійцями.

Підчас індустріалізації ХІХ та початку ХХ столітть населення міста швидко збільшується (від кількох тисяч наприкінці XVIII століття, до сотен тисяч на початку ХХ). Частково це відбувається за рахунок переселення до міста франко-канадських селян, частково&nbsp;— завдяки імміграції.

----

=== Англо- й франкомовні монреальці ===

Під час Нової Франції майже всі колоністи були французькими католиками. Після англійського завоювання (1759—1763&nbsp;рр.) іммігранти були майже винятково англомовними. І аж наприкінці ХІХ століття з'явилися так звані алофони&nbsp;— іммігранти, для яких рідною мовою не була ані англійська, ані французька.

''Бульвар Сен-Лоран'' був неформальним кордоном між англо- та франкомовними монреальцями. На заході від бульвару був відносно багатий «англійський» Монреаль, на сході&nbsp;— Монреаль «французький», значно бідніший від «англійського». Відносини між двома спільнотами були (й залишаються) не найкращими.

Слід додати, що «франко-» монреальців завжди було значно більше, ніж «англо-».

Протягом майже всього ХІХ століття велика більшість іммігрантів були англійцями, шотландцями, або ірландцями. Але з кінця ХІХ століття у місті збільшується кількість представників інших народів. Все більше стає італійців, євреїв, українців, поляків, німців. З'являється й помітна китайська діаспора.

Більшість іммігрантів інтегрується у англомовне середовище й навіть не намагається вивчити французьку. Це можна пояснити двома причинами: 1) англомовні були багатші, в них були кращі учбові заклади, англійською легше було зробити кар'єру; 2) до 1960х років франкомовне суспільство було патріархальне й майже повністю закрите для «чужинців».

Після так званої ''Тихої революції'' (fr. Révolution tranquille) 1960х років франкоканадське суспільство різко змінилося. Церкви спорожніли. Народжуваність впала. Суспільство стало відкритішим. Прагнучи побудувати сучасну націю, квебекські політики закликали до інтеграції іммігрантів до франкомовного суспільства.

Але попри числені зусилля, більшість переселенців продовжувала обирати англійську, бо вважала це вигіднішим для себе. Вони інтегрувалися у англомовне суспільство. За умов низької народжуваності серед франкоканадців, така тенденція загрожувала французькій мові та квебекській культурі поступовим зникненням.

Прийнятий наприкінці 1970х, ''Закон 101'' захищає французьку мову (зокрема, у освіті й комерційній рекламі).

'''Montreal''', or '''Montréal''' in French,<ref>It is most common to omit the acute accent in English-language usage (Montreal), unless one is using a proper name where the context requires the use of the accent (e.g. Le Journal de Montréal, as compared to the Montreal Gazette), and to keep the accent in French-language usage (Montréal). This is also the approach favoured by The Canadian Press Style Book (ISBN 0-920009-32-8, at p. 234) and the Globe and Mail Style Book (ISBN 0-7710-5685-0, at p. 249).

Montreal was the largest city in Canada up until the 1970s, when it was eclipsed in size by Toronto.

Seventy years later, French explorer Seigneurial title to the Island of Montreal in the name of the Société de Notre-Dame de Montréal to establish a Roman Catholic mission for evangelizing natives. Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve was the governor of the colony.

Ville-Marie became a centre for the French exploration in North America. It remained a French colony until 1760, when it was surrendered to Great Britain.

Montreal was incorporated as a city in 1832. The opening of the Victoria Bridge established Montreal as a major railway hub. By 1860, it was the largest city in British North America and the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Canada.

Montreal was the capital of the Tory mob burnt down the Parliament building to protest passage of the Rebellion Losses Bill. <ref>{{cite web

During federal government's registry of all men and women. Ottawa was furious over Houde's insubordination and held him in a prison camp until 1944, when the government was forced to institute conscription (see Conscription Crisis of 1944).

thumb|left|Montreal, 1959
Montreal's population surpassed one million in the early 1950s. The Saint Lawrence Seaway opened in 1959, allowing vessels to bypass Montreal: a development that would in time help to spell the end of the city's economic dominance. However, the 1960s saw continued growth, including Expo 67, the construction of Canada's tallest skyscrapers, new expressways and the Montreal Metro system.

The 1970s ushered in a period of wide-ranging social and political changes, stemming in large part from the concerns of the French-Canadian majority about the conservation of their culture and language, given the traditional predominance of the English-Canadian minority in the business arena. The October Crisis and the election of the separatist political party, the Parti Québécois, resulted in major political, ethnic and linguistic shifts. Despite hosting the 1976 Summer Olympics, Montreal lost its title of Canada's largest and most influential city to Toronto.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth than many other major Canadian cities. By the late 1990s, however, Montreal's economic climate had improved, as new firms and institutions began to fill the traditional business and financial niches.

Montreal was merged with the 27 surrounding municipalities on the Island of Montreal on January 1, 2002. The merger created a unified city of Montreal which covered the entire island of Montreal. This move proved unpopular, and several former municipalities, totalling 13% of the population of the island, voted to leave the newly unified city in separate referendums in June 2004. The demerger took place on January 1, 2006, leaving 15 municipalities on the island, including Montreal.

==Geography==

thumb|right|A street in Montreal after a snowstorm.
Montreal is located in the southwest of the province of federal capital. It also lies 502 kilometres (312&nbsp;mi) northeast of Boston and 530 kilometres (329&nbsp;mi) directly north of New York City.<ref name="Time and Date"></ref>

The city is located on the central and eastern portions of the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers. The port of Montreal lies at one end of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, which is the river gateway that stretches from the Great Lakes into the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name="Great Canadian Rivers"></ref> Montreal is defined by its location in between the St. Lawrence river on its south, and by the Rivière des Prairies on its north. The city is named after the most prominent geographical feature on the island, a three-head hill called Mount Royal.<ref name="Natural Resources Canada"></ref>

Montreal is at the centre of the Montreal Metropolitan Community, and is bordered by the city of Laval to the north, Longueuil, St. Lambert, Brossard, and other municipalities to the south, Repentigny to the east and the West Island municipalities to the west. The Westmount, Montreal West, Hampstead, Côte Saint-Luc, the Town of Mount Royal and the Montreal East are all entirely surrounded by the city of Montreal.<ref name="City Map"></ref>

===Climate===
Montreal lies at the confluence of several climatic regions. Usually, the humid continental or hemiboreal (Köppen climate classification ''Dfb'').

Precipitation is abundant with an average in) per year in the winter. Regular rainfall throughout the year averages 900 mm (35.3&nbsp;in). Summer is the wettest season statistically, but it is also the sunniest.

The coldest month of the year is January which has a daily average temperature of −10.4&nbsp;°C (13&nbsp;°F) — averaging a daily low of −14.9&nbsp;°C (5.2&nbsp;°F), colder than either Moscow (-10 °C) or Saint Petersburg (-6 °C). Due to wind chill, the perceived temperature can be much lower than the actual temperature, and wind chill factor is often included in Montreal weather forecasts. The warmest month is July which has an average daily high of 26.3&nbsp;°C (79.3&nbsp;°F); lower nighttime temperatures make an average of 20.9&nbsp;°C (69.6&nbsp;°F) thus air exchangers often achieve the same result as air conditioners. The lowest temperature ever recorded was −37.8&nbsp;°C (−36.0&nbsp;°F) on 15 January 1957 and the highest temperature ever was 37.6&nbsp;°C (99.7&nbsp;°F) on 1 August 1975.<ref name="climate" /> High humidity is common in the summer which makes the perceived temperature higher than the actual temperature. In spring and autumn, rainfall averages between 55 and 94 millimetres (2.2 and 3.7&nbsp;in) a month. Some snow in spring and autumn is normal. Similarly, late heat waves as well as "Indian summers" are a regular feature of the climate.<ref></ref>

2006 was noted as the only year in the history of Montreal when there was more rain than there was snow. There were 122.3 cm (48.1 in) of snow, and there were 122.5 cm (48.2 in) of rain. That year, Montreal received more rain than Vancouver, British Columbia.<ref>[http://climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climateData/monthlydata_e.html?timeframe=3&Prov=XX&StationID=5415&Year=2006&Month=1&Day=1 Montreal Monthly Data Report for 2006]</ref><ref>

===Architecture===

thumb|right|Montreal City Hall
For over a century and a half, Montreal was the industrial and financial centre of Canada. The variety of buildings included factories, elevators, warehouses, mills, and refineries which today provide a legacy of historic and architectural interest, especially in the downtown area and the Old Port area.

Today there are also many historical buildings in Old Montreal still in their original form: Olympic Stadium and surrounding structures, are but a few notable examples of 20th century architecture.

Pavilions designed for the 1967 International and Universal Exposition, popularly known as Expo 67, featured a wide range of architectural designs. Though most pavilions were temporary structures, several remaining structures have become Montreal landmarks, including the geodesic dome US Pavilion, now the Montreal Biosphère, as well as Moshe Safdie's striking Habitat 67 apartment complex.

The Montreal Metro is filled with a profusion of public artwork by some of the biggest names in Quebec culture. The design and ornamentation of each station in the Metro system is unique.

In 2006, the city was recognized by the international design community as a UNESCO City of Design, one of the three world design capitals.<ref></ref>

===Neighbourhoods===
thumb|right|Chinatown in Montreal

====Downtown Montreal====

thumb|left|Evening skyline
Downtown Montreal lies at the foot of Ville Marie borough. The Downtown area contains dozens of notable skyscrapers — which bylaws restrict to the height of Mount Royal — including the aforementioned 1000 de La Gauchetière and 1250 René-Lévesque. The Tour de la Bourse (Stock Exchange Tower) is also another significant building in Montreal, and is home to the Montreal Exchange, which trades in derivatives such as futures contracts and options. The Montreal Exchange was the first stock exchange in Canada. In 1999 all stock trades were transferred to Toronto in exchange for exclusivity in derivatives trading.

underground city, the world's largest, with indoor access to over 1,600 shops, restaurants, offices, businesses, museums and universities, as well as metro stations, train stations, bus terminals, and tunnels extending all over downtown. The central axis for downtown is Sherbrooke, René Lévesque, Peel, de la Montagne, de Maisonneuve and Crescent. The downtown Ville-Marie borough includes two islands, Île Ste. Hélène and La Ronde, the sole amusement park in the Montreal area, is located on Île Sainte-Hélène and is home to the Montreal Fireworks Festival in the summer.

====Old Montreal====

thumb|right|Place d'Armes and Notre Dame Basilica in winter
Old Montreal ''(French: Vieux-Montréal)'' is a historic area located southeast of downtown containing many different attractions such as the Old Port of Montreal, Place Jacques-Cartier, Montreal City Hall, the Bonsecours Market, Place d'Armes, Pointe-à-Callière Museum, the Notre-Dame de Montréal Basilica, and the Montreal Science Centre.

Architecture and cobbled streets in Old Montreal have been maintained or restored and are frequented by horse-drawn underground city and is served by several STM bus routes and metro stations, ferries to the South Shore and a network of bicycle paths.

Old Montreal was once a worldwide port, but shipping has been moved further east to a new larger site, leaving the Old Port as a historical area. The newer port is now the biggest container port in North America.  The riverside area adjacent to Old Montreal is known as the Old Port. It is now a recreational and historical area maintained by Parks Canada.

===Mount Royal===

thumb|right|Cross on top of [[Mount Royal, at night]]
The mountain is the site of '''New York's Central Park, and inaugurated in 1876.

The park contains two belvederes, the more prominent of which is the Kondiaronk Belvedere, a semicircular plaza with a ski slope; a sculpture garden; Smith House, an interpretive centre; and a well-known monument to Sir George-Étienne Cartier. The park hosts athletic, tourist, and cultural activities.

The mountain is also home to two major cemeteries, Notre-Dame-des-Neiges (founded in 1854) and Mount Royal (1852). Mount Royal Cemetery is a  terraced cemetery on the north slope of Mount Royal in the borough of Outremont. Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges is much larger, predominantly French-Canadian and officially Catholic<ref>[http://www.cimetierenddn.org/en/le_cimetiere/mission.asp Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery Mission]</ref>. More than 900,000 people are buried there.

Mount Royal Cemetery contains more than 162,000 graves and is the final resting place for a number of notable Canadians. It includes a veterans section with several soldiers who were awarded the British Empire's highest military honour, the Victoria Cross. In 1901 the Mount Royal Cemetery Company established the first crematorium in Canada.

The name of the city of Montreal derives from ''mont Réal'', an orthographic variant introduced either in French, or by an Italian map maker ("Mount Royal" is ''monte Reale'' in Italian). The name had been unofficially applied to the city, formerly Ville-Marie, by the 18th century.

The first cross on the mountain was placed there in 1643 by praying to her to stop a disastrous fibre-optic light in 1992. The new system can turn the lights red, blue, or purple, the last of which is used as a sign of mourning between the death of the Pope and the election of the next.

===Underground City===
thumb|right|Halles de la gare, going ''from'' [[Central Station (Montreal)|Gare centrale ''to'' Place Ville-Marie]]

Extending all over downtown is Montreal's Underground City ''(French: La ville souterraine)'', a set of pedestrian levels built to cross under streets, thereby connecting buildings to each other. It is also known as the indoor city (ville intérieure), as not all of it is underground. The connections are considered tunnels architecturally and technically, but have conditioned air and good lighting as any building's liveable space does. Many tunnels are large enough to have shops on both sides of the passage. With over 32 kilometres (20&nbsp;mi) of tunnels spread over more than twelve sq&nbsp;mi), connected areas include metro stations, two commuter train stations, a regional bus terminal and the Bell Centre amphitheatre and arena. There are more than 120 exterior access points to the underground city. Each access point is an entry point to one of 60 residential or commercial complexes comprising 3.6 square kilometres (1.4&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of floor space, including 80% of all office space and 35% of all commercial space in downtown Montreal. In winter, some 500,000 people use the underground city every day. Because of its Underground City, Montreal is often referred to as "Two Cities in One."

Montreal was the host of the 1976 Summer Olympics. The Montreal Games were the most expensive in Olympic history, costing over $5 billion (equivalent to $20 billion in 2006). Bad planning led to the Games' cost far exceeding the budget, and the city just finished paying the debt off in December 2006. However, the games were still considered an immense success in the eyes of the IOC, and it furthered Montreal's reputation on the world stage. For a time, it seemed that the Olympic Games might no longer be a viable financial proposition. There was also a boycott by African nations to protest against a recent tour of apartheid-run South Africa by a New Zealand rugby side. The Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci won the women's individual all around gold medal with two of four possible perfect scores, thus giving birth to a gymnastics dynasty in Romania.
