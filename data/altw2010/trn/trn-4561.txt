A '''blog''' (a contraction of the term '''web log''') is a website, usually maintained by an individual, with regular
entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as graphics or video.  Entries are commonly displayed in reverse chronological order. "Blog" can also be used as a verb, meaning ''to maintain or add content to a blog.''

Many blogs provide commentary or news on a particular subject; others function as more personal online diaries. A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. The ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (artlog), photographs (photoblog), sketches (sketchblog), videos (vlog), music (MP3 blog), audio (podcasting) are part of a wider network of social media. Micro-blogging is another type of blogging which consists of blogs with very short posts.
As of December 2007, blog search engine Technorati was tracking more than 112 million blogs.<ref></ref> With the advent of video blogging, the word ''blog'' has taken on an even looser meaning of any bit of media wherein the subject expresses his opinion or simply talks about something.

==Types==
There are many different types of blogs, differing not only in the type of content, but also in the way that content is delivered or written.

;Personal blogs:  The personal blog, an on-going diary or commentary by an individual, is the traditional, most common blog.   Personal bloggers usually take pride in their blog posts, even if their blog is never read by anyone but them.  Blogs often become more than a way to just communicate; they become a way to reflect on life or works of art.  Blogging can have a sentimental quality.  Few personal blogs rise to fame and the mainstream, but some personal blogs quickly garner an extensive following. A type of personal blog is referred to as "microblogging," which is extremely detailed blogging as it seeks to capture a moment in time. Sites, such as Twitter, allow bloggers to share thoughts and feelings instantaneously with friends and family and is much faster than e-mailing or writing. This form of social media lends to an online generation already too busy to keep in touch. <ref></ref> 

;Corporate blogs: A blog can be private, as in most cases, or it can be for business purposes. Blogs, either used internally to enhance the communication and culture in a corporation or externally for marketing, branding or public relations purposes are called corporate blogs.

;By media type: A blog comprising videos is called a vlog, one comprising links is called a linklog, a site containing a portfolio of sketches is called a sketchblog or one comprising photos is called a photoblog.<ref></ref> Blogs with shorter posts and mixed media types are called tumblelogs.

:An Artlog is a form of art sharing and publishing in the format of a blog, but differentiated by the predominant use of and focus on Art work rather than text.

:A rare type of blog hosted on the Gopher Protocol is known as a Phlog

;By device: Blogs can also be defined by which type of device is used to compose it. A blog written by a PDA could be called a moblog.<ref></ref>  One early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared diary of a person's personal life combining text, video, and pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site.  This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance.  Such journals have been used as evidence in legal matters.

;By education blogs, classical music blogs,quizzing blogs and legal blogs (often referred to as a blawgs) or dreamlogs. While not a legitimate type of blog, one used for the sole purpose of spamming is known as a Splog.

;'''Question blogging''': is a type of blog that answers questions. Questions can be submitted in the form of a submittal form, or through email or other means such as telephone or VOIP. Qlogs can be used to display shownotes from podcasts <ref>[http://techguylabs.com/radio/ShowNotes/Show465] "Podcast Shownotes"</ref> or the means of conveying information through the internet. Many question logs use syndication such as RSS as a means of conveying answers to questions.

== Community and cataloging ==

;The Blogosphere:  The collective community of all blogs is known as the blogosphere.  Since all blogs are on the internet by definition, they may be seen as interconnected and socially networked.  Discussions "in the blogosphere" have been used by the media as a gauge of public opinion on various issues.  A collection of local blogs is sometimes referred to as a bloghood.

;Blog search engines: Several blog search engines are used to search blog contents, such as tags used to categorize blog postings. Research community is working on going beyond simple keyword search, by inventing new ways to navigate through huge amounts of information present in the blogosphere, as demonstrated by projects like BlogScope.

;Blogging Communities and Directories: Several online communities exist that connect people to blogs and bloggers to other bloggers, including  BlogCatalog and MyBlogLog.  

;Blogging and "fake blogs" in which a company will create a fictional blog as a marketing tool to promote a product.

==Popularity ==
Researchers have analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular. There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e. blogroll). The basic conclusion from studies of the structure of blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, permalinks can boost popularity more quickly, and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls, since they denote that people are actually reading the blog's content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.<ref>Marlow, C. [http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cameron/cv/pubs/04-01.pdf Audience, structure and authority in the weblog community]. Presented at the International Communication Association Conference, May, 2004, New Orleans, LA.</ref>

The blogdex project was launched by researchers in the MIT Media Lab to crawl the Web and gather data from thousands of blogs in order to investigate their social properties. It gathered this information for over 4 years, and autonomously tracked the most contagious information spreading in the blog community, ranking it by recency and popularity. It can thus be considered the first instantiation of a memetracker. The project is no longer active, but a similar function is now served by tailrank.com.

Blogs are given rankings by Technorati based on the number of incoming links and Alexa Internet based on the web hits of Alexa Toolbar users. In August 2006, Technorati found that the most linked-to blog on the internet was that of Chinese actress Xu Jinglei.<ref name="Fickling">Fickling, David, [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2006/08/15/internet_killed_the_tv_star.html Internet killed the TV star], The Guardian NewsBlog, 15 August 2006</ref>  Chinese media Xinhua reported that this blog received more than 50 million page views, claiming it to be the most popular blog in the world.<ref></ref>   Technorati rated Boing Boing to be the most-read group-written blog.<ref name="Fickling"/>

Gartner forecasts that blogging will peak in 2007, leveling off when the number of writers who maintain a personal website reaches 100 million. Gartner analysts expect that the novelty value of the medium will wear off as most people who are interested in the phenomenon have checked it out, and new bloggers will offset the number of writers who abandon their creation out of boredom. The firm estimates that there are more than 200 million former bloggers who have ceased posting to their online diaries, creating an exponential rise in the amount of "dotsam" and "netsam" — that is to say, unwanted objects on the Web.

==Blurring with the mass media==
Many bloggers, particularly those engaged in ''Time'' magazine naming their 2006 person of the year as "you".

Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs — well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list. The first known use of a weblog on a news site was in August 1998, when Jonathan Dube of The Charlotte Observer published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.<ref></ref>

Some bloggers have moved over to other media. The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: Duncan Black (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), Glenn Reynolds (Instapundit), Markos Moulitsas Zúniga (Daily Kos), Alex Steffen (Worldchanging) and Ana Marie Cox (Wonkette). In counter-point, Hugh Hewitt exemplifies a mass media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in "old media" by being an influential blogger.

Blogs have also had an influence on Gaelic languages. Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging.

There are many examples of bloggers who have published books based on their blogs, e.g., Salam Pax, Ellen Simonetti, Jessica Cutler, ScrappleFace.  Blog-based books have been given the name blook. A prize for the best blog-based book was initiated in 2005, <ref></ref> the Lulu Blooker Prize.<ref></ref> However success has been elusive offline, with many of these books not selling as well as their blogs. Only blogger Tucker Max cracked the New York Times Bestseller List. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/fashion/sundaystyles/16CADS.html?ex=1302840000&en=778087aa367d0620&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss Dude, here's my book]</ref>

== Blogging consequences ==
The emergence of blogging has brought a range of legal liabilities and other often unforeseen consequences. 

=== Defamation or liability===
Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers concerning issues of defamation or liability.  The courts have returned with mixed verdicts.  Internet Service Providers (ISPs), in general, are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties (U.S. Communications Decency Act and the EU Directive 2000/31/EC).
  
In ''John Doe v. Patrick Cahill'', the Delaware Supreme Court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask anonymous bloggers, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration. In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival. The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/delawarestatecases/266-2005.pdf John Doe No. 1 v. Patrick Cahill and Julia Cahill]</ref>

In January 2007, two prominent Malaysian political bloggers, Jeff Ooi and Ahiruddin Attan were sued by pro-government newspaper, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan, Hishamuddin bin Aun and Brenden John a/l John Pereira over an alleged defamation. The plaintiff was supported by the Malaysian government. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=20489|title=New Straits Times staffers sue two bloggers
|work=Reporters Without Borders|date=2007-01-19|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref>  Following the suit, the Malaysian government proposed to "register" all bloggers in Malaysia in order to better control parties against their interest. <ref></ref> This is the first such legal case against bloggers in the country.

In the United Kingdom, a college lecturer contributed to a blog in which she referred to a politician (who had also expressed his views in the same blog) using various uncomplimentary names, including referring to him as a "Nazi". The politician found out the real name of the lecturer (she wrote under a pseudonym) via the ISP and successfully sued her for £10,000 in damages and £7,200 costs.<ref></ref>  

In the United States blogger Aaron Wall was sued by Traffic Power for defamation and publication of trade secrets in 2005.<ref></ref> According to Wired Magazine, Traffic Power had been "banned from Google for allegedly rigging search engine results."<ref>Wired Magazine, [http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/09/68799 Legal Showdown in Search Fracas], Sept 8, 2005</ref> Wall and other "white hat" search engine optimization consultants had exposed Traffic Power in what they claim was an effort to protect the public. The case was watched by many bloggers because it addressed the murky legal question of who's liable for comments posted on blogs.<ref>[http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/05/08/31/1427228.shtml?tid=123 Slashdot, Aug 31]</ref>The case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Traffic Power failed to appeal within the allowed time.<ref>[http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060413-084431 SearchEngineWatch]</ref>

=== Employment ===
In general, attempts at hiding the blogger's name and/or the place of employment in anonymity have proved ineffective at protecting the blogger.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/catherine_sanderson/2007/04/blogger_beware.html|last=Sanderson|
first=Cathrine|title=Blogger beware!|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|date=2007-04-02|accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref>  Employees who blog about elements of their place of employment raise the issue of employee branding, since their activities can begin to affect the brand recognition of their employer.

Ellen Simonetti, a Delta Air Lines flight attendant, was fired by the airline for photos of herself in uniform on an airplane and comments posted on her blog "Queen of Sky: Diary of a Flight Attendant" which her employer deemed inappropriate.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  This case highlighted the issue of personal blogging and freedom of expression vs. employer rights and responsibilities, and so it received wide media attention.  Simonetti took legal action against the airline for "wrongful termination, defamation of character and lost future wages".<ref></ref>  The suit is postponed while Delta is in bankruptcy proceedings ([http://deltadocket.com/delta_downloads/delta_downloads_CourtFiledDocuments/Twelfth_OmnibusClaimsObjection.pdf court docket]).

In the spring of 2006, Erik Ringmar, a tenured senior lecturer at the London School of Economics was ordered by the convenor of his department to "take down and destroy" his blog in which he discussed the quality of education at the school.<ref> See also [http://ringmar.net/forgethefootnotes/ Forget the Footnotes]</ref>

sued by one of her former lovers in a case that could establish the extent to which bloggers are obligated to protect the privacy of their real life associates.<ref></ref>

Catherine Sanderson, aka Petite Anglaise, lost her job in Paris at a British accountancy firm as a consequence of blogging.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/07/19/france.blog/index.html?section=cnn_tech |

===Political dangers===
Blogging can sometimes have unforeseen consequences in politically sensitive areas. Blogs are much harder to control than broadcast or even print media. As a result totalitarian and authoritarian regimes often seek to suppress blogs, or to punish those who maintain them.
