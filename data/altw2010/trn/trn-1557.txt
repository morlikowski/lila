'''Oakland County''' is a county in the Pontiac. Oakland County is part of the Detroit metropolitan area, though the actual city of Detroit is located in neighboring Wayne County, south of Ferndale, to wealthy cities such as Birmingham and Bloomfield Hills. The white-collar cities of Troy, Southfield, Farmington Hills and Auburn Hills host a rich mix of Fortune 500 companies. The city of Royal Oak, home of the Rochester Hills.

Metro Detroit's suburbs are among the most affluent in the nation. Oakland County is the fourth wealthiest county in the United States among counties with more than one million people.<ref name=RichSuburbs> {{cite web

All three automotive companies are major employers within southeast Michigan, and have significant investments within Oakland County.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 908 square miles (2,352&nbsp;km²). Of that, 873 square miles (2,260&nbsp;km²) is land and 35 square miles (92&nbsp;km²) of it (3.91%) is water.

Oakland County was originally divided into 25 separate townships, which are listed below. Each township is roughly equal in size at six miles by six miles for a total township area of 36 square miles.  The roots of this design were born out of the Land Ordinance of 1785 and the subsequent Northwest Ordinance of 1787.  Oakland County itself is a prime example of the land policy that was established, as all townships are equal in size (save for slight variations due to waterways).  Section 16 in each township was reserved for financing and maintaining public education, and even today many schools in Oakland County townships are located within that section.

Wayne County, where the city of Detroit is located, borders Oakland County to the south. The southern boundary is black city and mostly white suburbs, although this pattern of ''de facto'' segregation has lessened somewhat in recent years, particularly in communities west of Woodward Avenue, where the African-American population has been on the increase.

==History==
Created by territorial Gov. Lewis Cass in 1819, sparsely settled Oakland was twice its current size at first, but shrank as Michigan's population grew and new counties were established. Woodward Avenue and the Detroit and Pontiac Railroad helped draw settlers in the 1840s. By 1840, Oakland had more than fifty mills. Pontiac, located on the Clinton River, was Oakland's first town and became the county seat. After the Civil War, Oakland was mainly an agricultural county with numerous isolated villages. By the end of the 19th Century, three rail lines served Pontiac and the city attracted carriage and wagon factories. Streetcars began moving people in the late 1890s.

Developers turned southern Oakland County into a suburb of Detroit in the 1890s, when a Cincinnati  firm platted a section of Royal Oak called "Urbanrest." Migration worked both ways. Several thousand people moved from Oakland County farms to Detroit as the city attracted factories. By 1910, a number of rich Detroiters had summer homes and some year-round residences in what became Bloomfield Hills. The auto age enveloped Pontiac in the early 1900s. The Oakland Motor Car Co. was born in 1907 and became a part of General Motors Corp., which was soon Pontiac's dominate firm.

In the 1950s, jobs and people began leaving Detroit. Northland Center opened in 1954. Oakland County passed Wayne County in effective buying power by 1961, when it ranked 28th in the nation in household income. It ranked second-highest nationally in per capita income for counties of more than a million people, behind New York County (Manhattan). The median price of a home in Oakland County skyrocketed to $164,697, more than $30,000 above the national median.

==Government==
The county government operates the jail,  operates the major local courts, keeps files of deeds and mortgages, maintains county board of commissioners controls the budget but has only limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions — police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. — are the responsibility of individual cities and townships. However Oakland County operates a Police force that is used throughout the county. Several cities do not have personalized police forces, but rather separate branches of the County Police have been set up for these regions. For instance, the City of Rochester Hills does not have a "Rochester Hills Police Department" but instead simply has cars marked Oakland County police. That branch operates as the Oakland County Police Department of Rochester Hills. 

Roads that are not maintained by a local community (city/village) are maintained by the [http://www.rcocweb.org/ Road Commission for Oakland County], which is governed by three board members appointed by the Oakland County Board of Commissioners.

==Politics==
Oakland County has historically been a stronghold of the Republican Party, in large part because of the party's support for policies that favor businesses. However, the county also contains a sizeable number of unaffiliated voters, many of whom have recently favored the Democratic Party. In the last three presidential elections, a narrow plurality of county voters have supported the Democratic candidate. 

In the U.S. House of Representatives, three members represent parts of Oakland County: Republicans Joe Knollenberg and Thaddeus McCotter, and Democrat Sander Levin.
