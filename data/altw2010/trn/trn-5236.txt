'''Annaberg''' is a district in the Stollberg and Mittlerer Erzgebirgskreis.

== History ==
In the Middle Ages the Ore Mountains were virtually unsettled and covered by dense forests. The towns of Annaberg and Buchholz (merged in 1945 to form Annaberg-Buchholz) were founded by the turn of the 16th century due to the discovery of silver and tin deposits. Now men from the Saxon lowlands moved into the mountains and founded lots of small towns and villages.

The district of Annaberg was established in 1874.

The district of Annaberg will become a part of the new district Erzgebirge. This district is going be established on 1st August 2008. The district Erzgebirge consists of the former districts of Annaberg, Stollberg, Aue-Schwarzenberg and Mittlerer Erzgebirgskeis (Marienberg). From the this time on the district of Annaberg does no longer exist.

== Geography ==
The district is located in the western Ore Mountains on the Czech border. It extends from the highest mountains on the border to more gentle hilly country in the north. The town of Oberwiesenthal is the highest located city of Germany. It is situated on the foot of the '''Fichtelberg''' (1214 m), the second highest peak of the Ore Mountains.
