'''Maastopuku''' on sotilaiden käyttämä asukokonaisuus, joka pyrkii sulauttamaan kantajansa ympäristöön. Näin sotilaiden visuaalinen havainnointi vaikeutuu. Maastopukuja valmistetaan useita erilaisia, eri armeijoiden toimesta ja erilaisia ympäristöjä varten (metsä, aavikko, asutuskeskukset).

== Historiaa ==

Maastopuku ei ollut vielä 1900-luvun alkupuolella laajassa käytössä. 1800-luvuilla armeijoilla oli käytössä niin kirkkaita värejä kuin rohkeita ja mahtipontisia kuvioitakin. Niiden tarkoitus oli säikäyttää vihollinen, houkutella uusia alokkaita joukkoihin, lisätä joukkojen yhteenkuuluvuuden tunnetta sekä mahdollistaa henkilöiden helppo tunnistaminen epäsuotuisissa sääolosuhteissa.

Pienet epäorganisoituneet joukot ottivat ensimmäisinä vähitellen käyttöön ruskeaa ja vihreää kuvioina sekoittaneet puvut. Pääjoukoilla oli edelleen käytössä vanhat värikkäät asut, kunnes he vakuuttuivat uusien pukujen hyödyistä. Kuolemantapausten johdosta britit joutuivat värjäämään punaiset tunikansa neutraaleimmiksi, ja lopulta mutaisen khakin värisiksi. Tämä toimenpide ei myöskään jäänyt pelkästään väliaikaiseksi, vaan siitä tuli standardimenettelytapa Intiassa palvelleille 1880-luvulla. Vuonna 1902 koko brittiarmeijan univormut vaihdettiin harmaanruskeisiin maastopukuihin.

'''Camouflage''' became an essential part of modern military tactics after the increase in accuracy and rate of fire of weapons during the 19th century. Despite camouflage's value, until the 20th century armies tended to use bright colours and bold, impressive designs. These were to daunt the enemy, foster unit cohesion, allow easier identification of units in the fog of war, and attract recruits. Not until these uniforms covered the bodies of men in long windrows across the battlefield was there pressure for change.

The intent of camouflage is to disrupt an outline by merging it with the surroundings, making a harder target to spot or hit. Different countries have undergone different evolution stages towards the development of military camouflage.

==History==

===United Kingdom===

In England, irregular units of gamekeepers in the 17th century were the first to adopt drab colours (common in the 16th century Irish units), following examples from the continent. A later example of a camouflaged unit would be the 95th Rifle Regiment, created during the Baker Rifles and engaged at a longer range, they were dressed in a jaeger tradition of rifle troops in Europe. The British in India were forced by casualties to dye their white summer khaki (from the Service Dress.

===France===
Other armies retained brighter colours. At the beginning of French retained red (''garance'') trousers until early 1915. The French also adopted a "horizon blue" jacket. The Belgian Army started using khaki uniforms in 1915. 

The French established a ''Section de Camouflage'' (Camouflage Department) in 1915, briefly headed by the front) mainly producing camouflage netting and painted canvas. Netting quickly moved from wire and fabric to raffia, burlap, and cocoa— natural materials was always recommended.

===Other nations===
The United States, who had green-jacketed rifle units in the Civil War, was quick to follow the British, going khaki in the same year. Russia followed, partially, in 1908. The Germans adopted ''feldgrau'' ("field grey") in 1910.

==20th century wars==
===World War I===
thumb|200px|left|World War I [[Stahlhelm with camouflage pattern applied in the field]]
Units of ''Camoufleurs'' who were artists, designers, or architects were used by forces of the Russia. The word camouflage entered the English language in 1917.

Camouflage added to helmets was unofficially popular, but these were not mass-produced until the Germans began in 1916 to issue ''scrim.

Specialist troops, notably snipers, could be supplied with items of camouflage, including patterned veils for the head and gun, hand-painted overalls and scrim-covered netting or sacking — an adaptation of the rag camouflage used in Scotland by anti-poaching wardens, ''gillies'', the first ghillie suits.

===The Interwar period===
The first mass-produced military camouflage was the Italian ''telo mimetico'' ("mimetic cloth") pattern of 1929, used to cover a shelter-half (''telo tenda''), copied by the Germans in 1931 but with her own camouflage history, beginning in 1918 with the German ''Buntfarbenanstrich''. The Red Army issued "amoeba" disruptive-pattern suits to snipers from 1937 and all-white ZMK top-garments the following year, but it was not until hostilities began that more patterns were used.

===World War II===
With mass-production of patterned fabrics, they became more common on individual soldiers in World War II. Initially, patterning was uncommon, a sign of elite units, to the extent that captured camouflage uniforms would be recycled by an enemy.

===Germany===

The Germans experimented before the war and some army units used "splinter" pattern camouflage. Waffen-SS combat units experimented from 1935. The initial, and much other, Waffen-SS camouflage was designed by Prof. Johann Georg Otto Schick.

*''Platanenmuster'' – "plane-tree pattern" (1937 - 1942) – spring/summer- and autumn/winter variations
*''Rauchtarnmuster'' – "blurred edge" (1939 - 1944) – spring/summer- and autumn/winter variations
*''Palmenmuster'' – "palm pattern" (ca. 1941 – ?) – summer/autumn variations
*''Beringtes Eichenlaubmuster'' – "oak leaf B" (1942 bis 1945)
*''Eichenlaubmuster'' – "oak leaf A" (1943 - 1945) – spring/summer- and autumn/winter variations
*''Erbsenmuster'' – "pea pattern" (1944 - 1945) – spring/summer- and autumn/winter variations
*''Leibermuster'' (1945)
* and also ''telo mimetico'' ("mimetic cloth"), using fabric seized from the Italians in 1943 (the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler often wore this pattern).

The ''Sumpfmuster'' ("swamp pattern") is a Wehrmacht camouflage first introduced in 1943. A variation was introduced in 1944.

Apart from "Leibermuster", the official names of the wartime German camouflage patterns are not known: the names above are those used by military historians and collectors.

===USSR===

===United Kingdom===
Developed in the 1930s, khaki Battle Dress was issued widely from 1939. With the return of war, camouflage sections were revived. The British set up the Camouflage Development and Training Centre in 1940 at Farnham Castle, Surrey. Early staff included artists from the Industrial Camouflage Research Unit such as Roland Penrose and Frederick Gore, and the stage magician Jasper Maskelyne (later known for camouflage work in the North African campaign). The British did not use disruptive-pattern uniforms until 1942, with the hand-painted Denison smock for paratroopers, followed in 1943 with a similar style M42 garment.

===United States===

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began wide-ranging experiments in 1940, but little official notice was taken until 1942 when General U.S. Marines fighting on the Solomon Islands and worn by Marine Raiders and Paramarine units as well as many regular Marine units in the Battle of Tarawa. Battlefield experience showed that pattern was unsuitable for moving troops, and production was halted in 1944 with a return to standard single-tone uniforms. 

During 1944, specialized units of the 2nd Armored Division in the Normandy were issued with "frog skin"/"leopard spot" camouflage patterns, but similarity to the battledress worn by Waffen SS troops led to friendly fire and it was withdrawn [http://www.atthefront.com/us_uni_camo.htm]. 

Full "leopard spot" uniforms continued to be worn by the USMC Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion (whose role was reprised by the USMC Force Recon units from 1954) and by Combat Swimmer Reconnaissance Units (later to evolve into the Navy SEALs).

==Postwar==
===France===
'''Lizard pattern''' is a military camouflage used by the French Army on uniforms beginning in the 1950s up to the late 1980s. 
A Lizard pattern has two overlapping prints, generally green and brown, printed with gaps so that a third dyed color, such as a lighter green or khaki, makes up a large part of the pattern. In this, it is printed like earlier British patterns used on that country's paratroops' Denison smocks, and descends from those patterns. Lizard patterns have narrower printed areas than the British patterns, and strong horizontal orientation, cutting across the vertical form of a body.
Other patterns descend in turn from Lizard patterns, either by imitation such as Cuba's Lizard pattern, or innovation, such as the tigerstripe patterns produced during the Vietnam War.

===United Kingdom===
Battledress continued until the late 1950s. In the Olive Drab (OD).

With the end of National Service in 1961, the Army looked for a new uniform: smarter than battledress, but also more comfortable, while still having a military air. Using Korean War clothing as a basis, new items were developed for the 1960-pattern Combat Dress, including the so-called Canadian pattern combat jacket, which was made with a lining above the waist and reinforced elbows. The 1960s was a transition for the Army, reflected in changes in uniform. 

====Disruptive Pattern====

The new, smaller, all-volunteer Army could now afford to equip every soldier with his own camouflaged uniform, and a pattern, based on the brushstroke of the Denison Smock, was designed in 1960, called Disruptive Pattern (DP). The camouflage is more commonly known by the name given to the cloth printed with the pattern: Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM). By the late sixties it was issued in limited quantities on 1960-pattern jackets and trousers, making Britain the first country to issue regular troops with a standard camouflaged combat uniform. Known as ‘66-Pattern, it was superseded by the ’68-Pattern, which had a slightly revised design on a new uniform, featuring minor changes over the preceding 1960/66-Pattern kit, most notably: a full lining for jacket and trousers. DPM became official army-wide issue only in 1972.

Various redesigns since 1984 changed the size of the pattern and the tone of the colours, but DPM is easily recognisable and remains effective. Many countries use it or a variation <ref></ref>.

===United States===

Many war surplus "leopard spot" uniforms were sold to allied nations reforming their armed forces. Worn by French parachutists in the First Indochina War, the "leopard spot" was marketed to civilian hunters under the name "duck hunter". 

The CIA supplied "leopard spot" or “duck hunter” camouflage for Brigade 2506 Cuban exiles in the Bay of Pigs invasion and South Vietnamese and Montagnard Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) counter-guerrillas until the pattern was replaced by the tigerstripe pattern in the mid-1960s. [Blechman H & Newman A, 2004].

During the Rangers and Special Forces units (aka Green Berets) adopted the Vietnamese "Tigerstripe" pattern with its distinctive horizontal slashes of black, green, and tan. Although this style became popular among the troops, it was not an official government issue uniform. It was procured by private purchase from civilian tailors. This is also called the "The Green Berets''. Also in 1968, the brightly colored division shoulder patches worn since World War II were gradually replaced with a "subdued" green and black version. Name tags and other insignia patches soon followed.
