'''''Peregrinus''''' was the term used during the early Roman empire, from 30 BC to 212 AD, to denote a free provincial subject of the empire who was not a Roman citizen. ''Peregrini'' constituted the vast majority of the empire's inhabitants in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. ''Peregrini'' were effectively second-class citizens, until 212 AD, when all inhabitants of the Empire were granted citizenship.

During the Roman Republic, the term ''peregrinus'' denoted any person who did not hold Roman citizenship, full or partial, whether that person was under Roman rule or not. Technically, this remained the case under during the imperial era. But in practice the term became limited to subjects of the empire, with inhabitants of regions outside the empire's borders denoted ''barbari'' (barbarians).

==Numbers==

In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the vast majority (80-90%) of the empire's inhabitants were ''peregrini''. By 49 BC, all Italians were Roman citizens. Outside Italy, those provinces with the most intensive Roman colonisation over the circa two centuries of Roman rule probably had a Roman citizen majority by the end of Augustus' reign: Gallia Narbonensis (southern France), Hispania Baetica (Andalusia, Spain) and Africa proconsularis (Tunisia).<ref>Brunt (1971)</ref> In frontier provinces, the proportion of citizens would have been far smaller. For example, one estimate puts Roman citizens in Britain ca. 100AD at about 50,000, less than 3% of the total provincial population of ca. 1.7 million.<ref>Mattingly (2006) 166, 168)</ref> In the empire as a whole, we know there were just over 6 million Roman citizens in 47 AD, the last quinquennial Roman census return extant. This was just 9% of a total imperial population generally estimated at ca. 70 million at that time.<ref>Scheidel (2006) 9</ref>

==Social status==

In Latin ''peregrinus'' (from which derives the English word "pilgrim"; root words: ''per'' + ''agere'' = to travel far) means "foreigner" or "stranger". But during the early Principate ''peregrini'' were not foreigners in the literal sense, since they were natives of provinces within the empire: indeed in their own provinces, it was the Romans who were the foreigners. Nonetheless, the superior legal and fiscal position of Roman citizens meant that ''peregrini'' were reduced to second-class status in their own countries.<ref>Hassall (1987) ''passim''</ref>

''Peregrini'' were accorded only the basic rights of the ius gentium ("law of peoples"), a sort of international law derived from the commercial law developed by Greek city-states,<ref>''Columbia Encyclopedia'' 6th Ed Article: ''Roman Law'' (Univ of Columbia Press)</ref> that was used by the Romans to regulate relations between citizens and non-citizens. But the ''ius gentium'' did not confer many of the rights and protections of the ''ius civile'' ("law of citizens" i.e. what we call Roman law). 

In the sphere of criminal law, there was no law to prevent the torture of ''peregrini'' during official interrogations. ''Peregrini'' were subject to ''de plano'' (summary) justice, including execution, at the discretion of the ''legatus Augusti'' (provincial governor). In theory at least, Roman citizens could not be tortured and could insist on being tried by a full hearing of the governor's assize court i.e. court held in rotation at different locations. This would involve the governor acting as judge, advised by a ''consilium'' ("council") of senior officials, as well as the right of the defendant to employ legal counsel. Roman citizens also enjoyed the important safeguard, against possible malpractice by the governor, of the right to appeal a criminal sentence, especially a death sentence, directly to the emperor himself.<ref>Burton (1987) 431</ref>

As regards civil law, ''peregrini'' were subject to the customary laws and courts of their ''civitas'' (an administrative circumscription, similar to a county, based on the pre-Roman tribal territories). Cases involving Roman citizens, on the other hand, were adjudicated by the governor's assize court, according to the elaborate rules of Roman civil law.<ref>Burton (1987) 433</ref>. This gave citizens a substantial advantage in disputes with ''peregrini'', especially over land, as Roman law would always prevail over local customary law if there was a conflict. Furthermore, the governor's verdicts were often swayed by the social status of the parties (and often by bribery) rather than by jurisprudence.<ref>Burton (1987) 432</ref> 

In the fiscal sphere, ''peregrini'' were subject to direct taxes (''tributum''): they were obliged to pay an annual Italy was exempt as was, probably, land owned by Roman colonies (''coloniae'') outside Italy.<ref>Hassall (1987) 690</ref>

In the military sphere, ''peregrini'' were excluded from service in the legions, and could only enlist in the less prestigious auxiliary regiments.<ref>Goldsworthy (2005) 80</ref>

In the social sphere, ''peregrini'' did not possess the right of ''connubium'' ("inter-marriage"): i.e. they could not legally marry a Roman citizen: thus any children from a mixed union were illegitimate and could not inherit citizenship (or property).  In addition, ''peregrini'' could not, unless they were auxiliary servicemen, designate heirs under Roman law.<ref>Mattingly (2006) 204</ref> On their death, therefore, they were legally intestate and their assets became the property of the state.

==Local authorities==

Each province of the empire was divided into three types of local authority: ''coloniae'' (Roman colonies, originally founded by retired legionary veterans), ''municipia'' (cities with "Latin Rights", a sort of half-citizenship) and ''civitates peregrinae'', the local authorities of the ''peregrini''.<ref>Hassall (1987) 689</ref> 

''Civitates peregrinae'' were based on the territories of pre-Roman city-states (in the Mediterranean) or indigenous tribes (in the northwestern European and Danubian provinces), minus lands confiscated by the Romans after the conquest of the province to provide land for legionary veterans or to become imperial estates. 

Although the provincial governor had absolute power to intervene in ''civitas'' affairs, in practice ''civitates'' were largely autonomous, in part because the governor operated with a minimal bureaucracy and simply did not have the resources for detailed micro-management of the ''civitates''.<ref>Burton (1987) 426, 434</ref> Provided that the ''civitates'' collected and delivered their assessed annual ''tributum'' (poll and land taxes) and carried out required services such as maintaining trunk Roman roads that crossed their territory, they were largely left to run their own affairs by the central provincial administration.

The ''civitates peregrinae'' were often ruled by the descendants of the aristocracies that dominated them when they were independent entities in the pre-conquest era, although many of these may have suffered severe diminution of their lands during the invasion period.<ref>Mattingly (2006) 454</ref> These elites would dominate the ''civitas'' council and executive magistracies, which would be based on traditional institutions.  They would decide disputes according to tribal customary law. If the chief town of a ''civitas'' was granted ''municipium'' status, the elected leaders of the ''civitas'', and, later, the entire council (as many as 100 men), were automatically granted citizenship.<ref>Hassall (1987) 694</ref> 

The Romans counted on the native elites to keep their ''civitates'' orderly and submissive. They ensured the loyalty of those elites by substantial favours: grants of land, citizenship and even enrollment in the highest class in Roman society, the senatorial order, for those who met the property threshold.<ref>Hassall (1987) 692</ref> These privileges would further entrench the wealth and power of native aristocracies, at the expense of the mass of their fellow ''peregrini''.

==Land ownership==

Nell'antica Roma, il "'''''peregrinus'''''" era una persona libera che era soggetta al dominio romano senza avere la cittadinanza romana, e dunque avevano minori diritti. Durante la Repubblica romana si usava questo termine per indicare anche coloro che non erano sotto dominio romano, ma in successivamente per questo concetto fu usato il termine "barbaro". Trattandosi di un concetto legato a quello di cittadinanza, un momento importante per la storia dei ''peregrini'' è il 212, quando Caracalla promulgò la ''Constitutio antoniniana'' con la quale estendeva la cittadinanza a tutti i soggetti dell'impero.<ref></ref>

Nel I e Giulio Cesare (Brunt, 1971).</ref> Fuori dall'Italia, le province che si trovavano da più tempo sotto il dominio romano probabilmente avevano una maggioranza di cittadini romani entro la fine del regno di Augusto: si tratta della Gallia Narbonense, della Hispania Baetica e dell'Africa proconsolare.<ref>Brunt 1971.</ref>

Le province di frontiera presentavano invece una minore percentuale di cittadini. Per esempio, si è stimato che i cittadini romani in Britanni intorno all'anno Claudio.<ref>Scheidel (2006) 9</ref>
