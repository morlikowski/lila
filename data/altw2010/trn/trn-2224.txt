'''빌헬름 푸르트벵글러'''(Wilhelm Furtwängler, 1886년 1월 25일 – 1954년 11월 30일)는 독일의 지휘자이자 작곡가였다.

== 생애 ==
푸르트벵글러는 베를린의 유명한 집안에서 태어났다. 그의 아버지 아돌프는 고고학자였고, 그의 어머니는 미술가, 그의 형 필립은 수학자였다. 그는 대부분의 어린 시절을 뮌헨에서 보냈는데, 거기에서 그의 아버지가 대학 강의를 하고 있었다. 그는 어린 시절부터 음악 교육을 받았고 베토벤에 대해 일찍이 애착을 키워갔는데, 그가 그의 생애를 통틀어 계속 가까운 관계를 유지한 작곡가였다.

푸르트벵글러가 나이 스물에 지휘자로서 데뷔할 시점까지 그는 몇몇 음악을 작곡했지만 그리 호평받지 못했고, 작곡가로서 삶이 초래할 경제적 불확실성과 맞물려 그로 하여금 지휘에 집중하게 했다. 그의 첫 공연에서, 그는 카임 오케스트라를 이끌고 안톤 브루크너의 교향곡 9번을 연주했다. 그는 순차적으로 뮌헨, 뤼벡, 만하임, 프랑크푸르트, 그리고 빈에서 지휘자 자리를 얻었고 이후 1920년에는 베를린 국립 관현악단, 1922년에는 아르투르 니키슈의 뒤를 이어 라이프치히 게반트하우스 관현악단과 동시에 명예로운 베를린 필하모닉 오케스트라 지휘자 자리를 차지했다. 나중에 그는 빈 필하모닉 오케스트라, 잘츠부르크 축제, 그리고 바이로이트 축제의 음악 감독이 되었으며, 이 지위는 그 당시 독일의 지휘자가 가질 수 있었던 가장 위대한 자리로 인식되어 왔던 자리였다.

푸르트벵글러는 그의 특출한 비정확성으로 유명했다. 그의 제자 세르주 첼리비다케는 그가 가장 잘 말할 수 있었던 말은 “음, 그냥 (음악을) 들어 보세요”였다고 기억했다. 독일 BBC 지사의 카를 브리니처(Carl Brinitzer)는 그와 인터뷰를 시도했고, 그는 그 앞에 한 명의 박약아가 앉아 있다는 생각이 들었다고 한다. 스톡홀름 왕립 필하모닉 오케스트라와 진행한 리허설 장면을 담은 실황 녹음은 거의 아무 것도 알아 들을 만한 말이 없고, 단지 험험 하는 소리와 중얼거림만 들린다. 그럼에도 불구하고 푸르트벵글러는 음악가들 사이에서 여전히 높이 존경받았다.

== 푸르트뱅글러와 나치 ==
푸르트벵글러의 아돌프 히틀러와 나치 당과의 관계와 그에 대한 태도는 많은 찬반 논란을 가져온 문제였다. 나치가 1933년에 실권을 장악했을 때에, 푸르트벵글러는 그들에게 굉장히 비판적이었다. 1934년에 그는 파울 힌데미트의 오페라 《화가 마티스》의 초연을 지휘하는 것을 금지당했다. 1936년에는 푸르트벵글러가 점점 정권에 실망하고 있던 때에 아르투로 토스카니니의 뒤를 이어 뉴욕 필하모닉의 상임 지휘자 자리를 제안받았다. 푸르트벵글러가 그 자리를 수락할 확률은 높았지만, 연합통신의 베를린 지부에서 온 보고는 (아마도 헤르만 괴링에 의해 사주되었을 듯) 그가 베를린 오페라의 지휘자 자리를 한 번 더 맡으려고 마음먹고 있다는 것이었다. 이는 뉴욕의 분위기를 그로부터 적대적이게 바꾸었다. 그들의 입장에서 이제 푸르트벵글러는 나치 당의 완전한 지지자로 보였던 것이다. 지금에 와서는 이런 인식이 사실이 아니었음이 널리 받아들여지고 있지만(가령, 푸르트벵글러는 나치식 경례를 하는 것을 항상 거부했다), 푸르트벵글러는 친 나치 인사였다는 인식이 그의 죽음 때까지는 우세한 시각이었다.

나치는 푸르트벵글러를 상대적으로 잘 대우해 주었다, 그는 높은 명성을 가진 인물이었고, 중요한 문화 인사였다. 그의 공연은 종종 사기를 올리기 위해 독일 군대에 중계되었고, 그는 당국자에 의해 그가 연주할 수 있는 곡목을 제한받았다. 유태인에 대한 그의 태도는 오늘날에도 찬반 논란이 남아 있다. 한 편으로 그는 아르투르 슈나벨과 같은 유타인 예술가를 두둔했지만, 다른 한 편으로 그는 유태인 상품에 대한 보이콧을 도왔으며 유태인의 신문에 대한 지배에 대해 비판적으로 보았다.

푸르트벵글러의 보호를 받은 한 명의 인물은 피아니스트 칼로베르트 크라이텐(Karlrobert Kreiten)이었다. 그는 또한 피아니스트이자 지휘자인 다니엘 바렌보임에게 중요한 영향을 끼쳤으며, 푸르트벵글러의 미망인인 엘리자베트 푸르트벵글러는 ”그는 푸르트벵글러-한다.(Er furtwänglere.)”고 말할 정도였다. 바렌보임은 최근에 시카고 교향악단과 푸르트벵글러의 교향곡 2번을 녹음했다. 

전쟁의 막바지에 이르러, 나치 당으로부터 심한 압력을 받은 푸르트벵글러는 스위스로 탈출했다. 그는 전쟁 이후에 연주와 녹음 활동을 재개했으며, 어떤 그림자 밑에 항상 있는 것처럼 보였지만 유럽에서 인기있는 지휘자로 계속 남았다. 그는 바덴바덴에서 1954년에 사망했다.

영국의 극작가 로널드 하우드(Ronald Harwood)의 연극 《Taking Sides》(1995년)에서는 1946년의 베를린의 미국 점령 지역을 배경으로, 푸르트벵글러를 나치 정권에 협력한 혐의로 고소하는 내용을 다루고 있다. 2001년에 연극은 영화로 만들어져 하비 케이텔(Harbey Keitel)이 주연을 맡고, 스텔란 스카스가르드(Stellan Skarsgård)가 푸르트벵글러 역을 맡았다.

그의 탈나치화 재판에서 그는 이렇게 말했다.

{{인용문|"나는 독일이 끔찍한 위험에 있었음을 알고 있었다. 나는 독일 음악에 대해 책임을 느꼈고, 이 위기를 내가 할 수 있는 한 많이 극복하는 게 내 임무였다. 나의 예술이 정치적 선전에 오용되고 있다는 의식은 독일 음악이 보존되어야 한다는, 독일인에 의해 독일인에게 음악을 제공해야 한다는 더 큰 의식에 자리를 양보해야 했다. 이 사람들, 바흐와 베토벤, 모차르트와 슈베르트의 동포는 여전히 완전히 전쟁에 사로잡힌 정권의 통제 하에 살아야 했다. 그 때에 거기에 살지 않았던 어떤 사람도 그것이 어떤 것이었는지에 대해 판단할 수 없을 것이다.

'''Wilhelm Furtwängler''' (German conductor and composer.

==Biography ==
Furtwängler was born in prominent family.  His father Adolf was an painter.<!--Philipp Furtwängler (*1869) couldn't be Wilhelm Furtwängler's (*1886) brother, because Wilhelm was the first child of his parents and his brother Philipp a mathematician.--> Most of his childhood was spent in Beethoven, a composer with whom he remained closely associated throughout his life.  Though his chief posthumous fame rests on his work as a conductor, he was also a composer and regarded himself first and foremost as such, having in fact first taken up the baton in order to perform his own works.

By the time of Furtwängler's conducting debut at the age of twenty, he had written several pieces of music.  However, they were not well received, and that - combined with the financial insecurity of a career as a composer - led him to concentrate on conducting.  At his first concert, he led the Ninth Symphony.  He subsequently held posts at Munich, Frankfurt, and Vienna, before securing a job at the Berlin Staatskapelle in 1920, and in 1922 at the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra where he succeeded Arthur Nikisch, and concurrently at the prestigious Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.  Later he became music director of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, the Salzburg Festival and the Bayreuth Festival, which was regarded as the greatest post a conductor could hold in Germany at the time.

Towards the end of the war, under extreme pressure from the Nazi Party, Furtwängler fled to ''Symphony No. 2 in E minor''.  Work on the symphony was begun in 1944, and carried on into 1945.  It was given its premiere in 1948 by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under Furtwängler's direction.  Furtwängler and the Philharmonic recorded the symphony for ''Sinfonie-Konzert (Symphonic Concerto for Piano and Orchestra)'' for piano and orchestra, completed and premiered in 1937 and revised in 1954.  Many themes from this work were also incorporated into Furtwängler's unfinished ''Symphony No. 3 in C sharp minor''.  The ''Sinfonie-Konzert'' is profoundly tragic, and the incorporation of a motif, seemingly from American popular music, in the third movement raises interesting questions of Furtwängler's view of his culture's future, not unlike the "ragtime" theme in the last movement of Brahms' Second Piano Concerto.

He resumed performing and recording following the war, and remained a popular conductor in Europe, although always under somewhat of a shadow.  He died in 1954 in Ebersteinburg close to Baden-Baden.  He is buried in Heidelberg's Bergfriedhof. 

Furtwängler is most famous for his performances of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner.  However, he was also a champion of modern music, and gave performances of thoroughly modern works such as Concerto for Orchestra''.

===Nazi Party ties===
Furtwängler's relationship with - and attitude towards - Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party was a matter of much controversy.  When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Furtwängler was highly critical of them.  In 1934, he was banned from conducting the premiere of Paul Hindemith's opera ''Mathis der Maler'', and Furtwängler resigned from his post at the Berlin Opera in protest.  In 1936, with Furtwängler becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the regime, there were signs that he might follow Erich Kleiber's footsteps into exile, when he was offered the principal conductor's post at the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, where he would have succeeded Arturo Toscanini.  Toscanini's biographer Harvey Sachs wrote that Toscanini recommended Furtwängler for the position, one of the few times Toscanini expressed admiration for a fellow conductor.  There is every possibility that Furtwängler would have accepted the post, but a report from the Berlin branch of the Associated Press, possibly ordered by Hermann Göring, said that he was willing to take up his post at the Berlin Opera once more.  This caused the mood in New York to turn against him; from their point of view, it seemed that Furtwängler was now a full supporter of the Nazi Party.

However, Furtwängler never joined the Nazi Party nor did he really approve of them,<ref>Galo, Gary A., Review of ''The Furtwängler Record'' by John Ardoin (December 1995).  ''Notes'' (2nd Ser.), '''52''' (2): pp. 483-485.</ref> much like the composer Taking Sides").  The sequence can also be seen in the excerpt of the 19 April 1942 performance of Beethoven's ninth symphony, available on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqff1F0Ijn0</ref>
 
Furtwängler was treated relatively well by the Nazis; he had a high profile, and was an important cultural figure.  His concerts were often broadcast to German troops to raise morale, though he was limited in what he was allowed to perform by the authorities.  He later said he tried to protect German culture from the Nazis;  it is now known that he used his influence to help Jewish musicians escape the Third Reich.

At his denazification trial, Furtwängler was charged with supporting Nazism by remaining in Germany, performing at Nazi party functions and with making an anti-Semitic remark against the part-Jewish conductor Victor de Sabata.<ref></ref> However, he was eventually cleared on all these counts.<ref></ref>

As part of his closing remarks at his denazification trial, Furtwängler said,

:"I knew Germany was in a terrible crisis; I felt responsible for German music, and it was my task to survive this crisis, as much as I could.  The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music be given to the German people by its own musicians.  These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had to go on living under the control of a regime obsessed with total war.  No one who did not live here himself in those days can possibly judge what it was like.

:"Does Himmler' one should not be permitted to play Beethoven?  Could he not realize, that people never needed more, never yearned more to hear Beethoven and his message of freedom and human love, than precisely these Germans, who had to live under Himmler’s terror?  I do not regret having stayed with them."

(quoted from John Ardoin's ''The Furtwängler Record'')

The violinist Yehudi Menuhin was among those in the Jewish music community and the United States who had a positive view of Furtwängler.  In 1933 he had refused to play with him, but in the late 1940s after a personal investigation about Furtwängler, he became supportive of him, and performed and recorded alongside him.<ref name="jb">{{cite web | title=Wilhelm Furtwängler | publisher=James C.S.

British playwright Taking Sides'' (1995), set in 1946 in the American zone of occupied Berlin, is about U.S. accusations against Furtwängler of having served the Nazi regime.  In 2001 the play was made into a motion picture directed by István Szabó and starring Harvey Keitel and featuring Stellan Skarsgård in the role of Furtwängler.<ref></ref>

In 1949 Furtwängler accepted the position of principal conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.  However the orchestra was forced to rescind the offer under the threat of a boycott from several prominent musicians including Vladimir Horowitz and Artur Rubinstein.<ref name="taubman">{{cite news

</ref>  According to a ''New York Times'' report, Horowitz said that he "was prepared to forgive the small fry who had no alternative but to remain and work in Germany."  But Furtwängler "was out of the country on several occasions and could have elected to keep out".<ref name="taubman"/>  Rubinstein likewise wrote in a telegram, "Had Furtwängler been firm in his democratic convictions he would have left Germany".<ref name="taubman"/>

==Career==
=== Conducting style ===
<!-- Deleted image removed: thumb|left|250px|Furtwängler is noted for his Beethoven recordings -->
Furtwängler had a unique conducting technique.  He saw symphonic music as creations of nature that could only be realised subjectively into sound.  This is why composers such as Beethoven, Brahms and Bruckner were so central to Furtwängler's repertoire, because he identified them as great forces of nature.  He disliked Toscanini's approach to the German repertoire.  He walked out of a Toscanini concert once, calling him "a mere time-beater!".  Furtwängler did not have a strong beat, as can be seen in video recordings [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqff1F0Ijn0] that show him making awkward, gawky movements like a medium in a trance.  He wished that the sense of time be established by the players in themselves, as in chamber music.  Furtwängler would then show the orchestra when he wished to use rubato.  His gestures bear seemingly little relationship to the rhythms of the music, while his physical motions were described as "like a puppet on a string" by one orchestra member [http://www.classicalnotes.net/features/furtwangler.html].  Furtwängler would generally hold his baton hand closer to his body and his left would be outstretched giving the expression of the phrase to the orchestra.  On occasion he would violently shake his baton hand when he would get into conducting fits onstage.  In the video above Furtwängler can be seen conducting Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on April 19th, 1942 in celebration of Hitler's birthday.  In the symphony's coda, Furtwängler can be seen having tremendous fits as he leads the orchestra through the chorus's final cries of "Götterfunken, Götterfunken!". 
Despite, or perhaps because of, this unorthodox style, musicians were mesmerised by his leadership.  His best performances are characterized by deep, bass-driven sonorities, soaring lyricism, and wrenching extremes of emotion co-existing with logical cogency.  Neville Cardus wrote in the ''Manchester Guardian'' in 1954 of Furtwängler's conducting style:

<blockquote>"He did not regard the printed notes of the score as a final statement, but rather as so many symbols of an imaginative conception, ever changing and always to be felt and realised subjectively...Not since Nikisch, of whom he was a disciple, has a greater personal interpreter of orchestral and opera music than Furtwängler been heard."<ref></ref></blockquote>

Many commentators and critics regard him as the one of the greatest conductors in history.<ref></ref>

Conductor and pianist Christoph Eschenbach has said of Furtwängler that he was a "formidable magician, a man capable of setting an entire ensemble of musicians on fire, sending them into a state of ecstasy".<ref>[http://www.christoph-eschenbach.com/index.php?lid=en&cid=2.2&pid=2 Christoph Eschenbach Own Words on His Life]</ref> 

thumb|Furtwängler commemorated on a stamp for [[West Berlin, 1955]]
Furtwängler was famous for his exceptional inarticulacy.  His pupil Sergiu Celibidache remembered that the best he could say was, "Well, just listen" (to the music).  Carl Brinitzer from the German BBC service tried to interview him, and thought he had an imbecile before him.  A live recording of a rehearsal with a Stockholm orchestra documents hardly anything intelligible, only hums and mumbling.  On the other hand, a collection of his essays, ''On Music,'' reveals deep thought.  Still, Furtwängler remained highly respected amongst musicians.  Even Arturo Toscanini, usually regarded as Furtwängler's complete antithesis (and sharply critical of Furtwängler on political grounds), once said &ndash; when asked to name the world's greatest conductor apart from himself &ndash; "Furtwängler!"

=== Influences ===
One of Furtwängler's protegés was pianist Karlrobert Kreiten.  He was also an important influence on the pianist/conductor Daniel Barenboim, of whom Furtwängler's widow, Elisabeth Furtwängler, said, "Er furtwänglert" ("He furtwänglers").  Barenboim recently recorded Furtwängler's 2nd Symphony with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
 Furtwängler's performances of Beethoven, Bruckner and Wagner remain important reference-points today.

== Notable recordings ==
There is a huge number of Furtwängler recordings currently available, mostly live.  Many of these were made during World War II using experimental tape technology.  After the war they were confiscated by the Soviet Union for decades, and have only recently become widely available, often on multiple legitimate and illegitimate labels.  In spite of their limitations, the recordings from this era are widely admired by Furtwängler devotees.

This is only a small selection of some of Furtwängler's most famed recordings.  For more information, see his [http://my.dreamwiz.com/fischer/Furtwangler/furtwangler-discography.htm discography] and [http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Namedrill?&name_id=4103&name_role=3 list of currently available recordings].
