During World War II, the facility was known as '''Garden City Army Airfield''' and was used as a United States Army Air Forces Second Air Force training field.

Opened in 1942, aircraft operated were Vultee BT-13A Valiants.  The BT-13 was the basic trainer flown by most pilots during WWII. It was the second phase of the three phase training program for pilots.

There were three auxiliary airfields associated with Garden City AAF which were built in 1943.  The main Garden City Army Airfield and it's auxiliaries were closed at the end of the war in 1945, and were declared excess by the military in 1947. Civil authorities developed the main airfield into Garden City Regional Airport.
