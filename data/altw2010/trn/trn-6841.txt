Il y a bien longtemps avant que la planète Krypton n'ait explosé, un trio de criminels sans merci, le général Zod, sa maîtresse Ursa et leur acolyte Non, ont tenté de voler un puissant cristal. Ayant échoué dans leur tentative et ayant été capturés par la police kryptonienne, Jor-El (le père du futur Superman) et les juges les condamnent à être emprisonnés dans la Zone Fantôme, une dimension de ténèbres fermée par une plaque transparente qui est envoyée errer dans l'espace.

Des années plus tard, Superman veille sur la planète Terre et la préserve de tous les dangers. Alors qu'il vient de sauver la Tour Eiffel de terroristes ayant placé une bombe nucléaire, il jette cette dernière dans l'espace. L'explosion brise la porte de la Zone Fantôme, et libére du coup les trois malfrats, qui, originaires de Krypton comme Superman, ont gagné des pouvoirs aussi puissants que les siens sous la lumière du Soleil. Ils décident d'aller dominer la Terre, tandis que Superman décide de faire un grand sacrifice pour l'amour de Lois Lane.

Lex Luthor s'enfuit de sa prison et amène les 3 criminels à sa Forteresse de la Solitude. Croyant annihiler les pouvoir de superman, Lex active une machine qui rend humain les 3 kryptoniens. Entre temps, Loïs réussit à démasquer Superman (et donc de ce fait, Clark Kent !) ; par amour il perd ses pouvoir, puis les retrouve pour continuer sa mission de protecteur de la planète Terre, mais il lui fit tout oublier à l'aide d'un baiser....

'''''Superman II''''' is the 1980 Superman''. It was the only % of the movie in 1977 before being taken off the project. Many of the scenes shot by second director Richard Lester (who had been an uncredited producer on the first film) in 1979 are refilmed Donner sequences. It was released in Europe and Australia in late 1980 but not in the United States until June 1981. Selected premiere engagements of ''Superman II'' were presented in Megasound, a high-impact surround sound system similar to Sensurround. It has since become the most fan-edited movie of all time, surpassing the Star Wars movies.  

According to statements by Donner, roughly 25% of the theatrical cut of ''Superman II'' contains footage he shot, including all of Gene Hackman's scenes. In 1984, when ''Superman II'' premiered on television, 24 minutes were re-inserted into the film (17 minutes on the American Broadcasting Company). Much of the extra footage was directed by Richard Donner. In the ABC-TV version, a U.S. "polar patrol" is shown picking up the three Kryptonians and Lex Luthor at the end of the film. Without this ending, it appears that Superman has let the Kryptonians die, though Superman has a strict code against killing and their deaths aren't necessary once they are depowered. On the other hand, the theatrical version's ending implies that Luthor is left stranded at the Fortress of Solitude, leaving the viewer to wonder how he got to prison in ''Superman IV: The Quest for Peace''--that question was answered in the extended versions. The ending of the extended cuts also has Superman, with Lois standing beside him, destroy the Fortress of Solitude. 

A brand new re-cut of the film, restoring as much of Donner's original conception as possible, titled ''Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut'', was released in November 2006. The latter part of the aforementioned scene can also be found on ''Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut'', while the part where the police arrive is a deleted scene.

==Plot==
A prologue recounts the trial of the Kryptonian criminals as seen at the beginning of ''Superman'' (although in this version of the scene, Jor-El is absent from the trial) in which Ursa and Non, are banished to the Phantom Zone by the Kryptonian high council as punishment for attempting to establish a dictatorship to rule Krypton.

After the opening credits, which recap many important scenes from ''Superman'', Clark Kent arrives for work and learns from his boss Perry White that Lois Lane is in France, where terrorists have seized the Eiffel Tower and threatened to level the city with a hydrogen bomb contained in an elevator. Clark immediately transforms into Superman and flies to Paris. He arrives just as the French authorities make an ill advised attempt to disarm the terrorists, by blowing up the support cables to the elevator where they are keeping the bomb. This activates the timer on the bomb and sends Lois, who had been hiding under the elevator seeking a story, plummeting. Superman catches the elevator, putting Lois out of harm's way, before throwing the elevator out of the atmosphere and into deep space, where it explodes. The shockwaves shatter the crystalline conduit into the Phantom Zone, now floating near Earth, and Zod, Non, and Ursa are released. 

Lex Luthor, meanwhile, has escaped prison with Miss Teschmacher's help, leaving a hapless Otis behind. Luthor locates Superman's Arctic Fortress of Solitude, where he learns from a hologram about the three Kryptonian villains. Putting the pieces of the puzzle together, he hurries south, convinced his device has detected the three criminals' alpha wave signatures.

Clark and Lois are sent on assignment to Niagara Falls, Ontario, investigating what Perry calls a "honeymoon racket." They are walking near the falls when a boy drops over the railing. In the confusion, Clark is able to get away, change into Superman and save the boy. Lois suddenly decides it is far too convenient that Clark disappears every time Superman makes an appearance, and that Superman just happened to be right on hand to save that little boy. Soon after, she tries to prove it by jumping into the Niagara River, screaming for Superman to save her. Clark does not change his identity and remains his nerdy self, feigning panic. However, unbeknownst to Lois, he uses his heat vision to sever a tree branch for Lois to use to stay afloat. After Lois gets herself to shore, she scolds herself for putting herself in danger and actually believing Superman could be such a weakling like Clark. 

However, later in their hotel room, Clark's powers are revealed when he accidentally trips and falls onto the fireplace with his bare hands. Seeing that he is unscathed, Lois realizes the truth. After some hesitation, Clark admits his secret identity and takes Lois to the Fortress of Solitude, showing her the crystals that created it and control its operations; given the green crystal to examine, Lois inadvertently leaves it under her purse, outside the control panel. After a conversation with the hologram of his mother Lara about the consequences of being in love with a "mortal" (Earth woman), Superman agrees to give up his powers to begin a relationship with Lois despite warnings that the process is irreversible. The process, which bombards Clark with a replication of the energy output spectrum of Krypton's sun, destroys the crystal control console. The two retire to his bedchamber.

Meanwhile, the three Kryptonian criminals have devastated a joint NASA-Soviet moon expedition, killing three astronauts. They fly to Earth, which they believe is called "Planet Houston" (having overheard radio transmissions with Mission Control in Houston, Texas). They wreak havoc on a small town (East Houston, Idaho), easily defeating the U.S. military. After defacing Mount Rushmore, the trio attacks the White House, where Zod forces the President of the United States to kneel before him.

Returning from the Fortress of Solitude, the now-depowered Clark is beaten up in a diner by a bullying truck driver. His despondent mood worsens when, in horror, he watches the President announcing his abdication and Zod's now-supreme authority over the Earth. The President suddenly pleads for Superman's help and Zod issues a challenge to Superman to face him. Realizing the danger posed to the world and the terrible mistake he made, Clark returns to the Fortress in search of a way to restore his lost powers. Arriving in the dark sanctum, he falls into despair, shouting for his father. He sees the green crystal glowing where Lois accidentally left it.

Meanwhile, General Zod and his cronies have grown bored with ruling the Earth, longing for a challenge. Lex Luthor pays them a visit in the Oval Office and negotiates a means to lure Superman to the villains by holding Lois hostage. He also reveals that Superman is the son of Jor-El, their imprisoner, knowing they will want revenge. They arrive at the Daily Planet offices and seize Lois, only to be interrupted by the arrival of Superman, his powers fully restored. A destructive battle ensues among the three Kryptonians as Superman struggles with the new experience of battling multiple enemies of his own power level. During the battle, Ursa and Zod discover Superman's weakness, his concern for human life, and use this against him. Finally, Superman flees, seemingly in defeat. Luthor convinces the villains that they must pursue Superman to his Fortress.  

At the Fortress of Solitude Superman presents himself atop an opening above them. Non immediately launches himself at him but is cast back to the ground by a triangular entrapment fabric thrown by Superman. Superman then repels all three of them attempting to overpower him with beams of energy. This fails and Superman attempts to distract the villains with a hologram that creates multiple images of himself throughout the fortress. This interesting duel concludes when Zod, slightly unsure, is seized and overpowered by the real Superman. However, after grappling with Zod, Ursa and Non threaten to tear Lois limb from limb, and Superman agrees to release Zod and capitulate to them to spare her life. Superman manipulates Luthor into tricking the criminals, counting on Luthor to double-cross him. Superman is forced into the same depowering chamber he used before, and the red Krypton sunlight that drains super-powers is actually set loose on the Fortress. The three supervillains are drained of their powers, Lois and Luthor are unaffected, while Superman is safe inside the chamber. Superman feigns weakness and then crushes Zod's hand after seemingly accepting it in submission. Lois easily dispatches the now-powerless Ursa, and Non leaps towards Superman, only to find he can no longer fly. All three villains fall into the depths of Superman's fortress, apparently to their doom. 

Back in Metropolis, Clark finds Lois in her office crying about how selfish she was to steal Clark away from his job as Superman. Clark then kisses Lois and in the process uses a form of telepathy to erase the knowledge of his dual identity from Lois, returning them to their usual status quo. 

Later, Clark takes revenge on the customer who bullied him at the diner, who breaks his hand after attempting to punch the Man of Steel. Clark then shyly claims he has been lifting weights and pays the truckstop owner for the damages. The film closes with Superman restoring the American flag atop the White House and assuring the President that he will never again abandon his duty as Superman. The film ends by stating that the series will continue in ''Superman III''.

Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty and Marlon Brando are the only actors who didn't participate in the film's reshoots. Their scenes in Lester's version (with the exception of Brando) were portrayed with body doubles.

In the 2006 documentary ''You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman'' (included in the DVD set ''Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition''), Sarah Douglas says she was the only cast member to do extensive around-the-world press tours in support of the movie, as she was one of the only actors who held a neutral point of view in the Donner/Lester controversy.

===Cameos===
Rhea Perlman and John Ratzenberger both make cameo appearances in the film. They would later appear on the long running sitcom ''Cheers'' from 1982-1993.

Richard Donner briefly appears in a "walking cameo" in the film. In the sequence where the de-powered Clark and Lois are seen approaching the truck-stop diner by car, Donner appears walking "camera left" past the driver's side. He is wearing a light tan jacket and appears to be smoking a pipe. In his commentary for ''Superman II'', Ilya Salkind states that the inclusion of his cameo in that scene is proof that the Salkinds held no animosity towards Donner, because if there were, then surely they would have cut it out.
