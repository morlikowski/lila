(פיני של הלאומית הפינית.

סיבליוס נולד למשפחה דוברת דוכסות הגדולה של פינלנד אשר הייתה בזמנו מדינה כחלק מהאימפריה הרוסית. שמו המלא היה יוהן יוליוס קריסטיאן סיבליוס (Johan Julius Christian Sibelius). בהיותו סטודנט אימץ את השם יאן, גרסה צרפתית לכינויו המשפחתי. הוא נשלח לבית ספר ידוע ללימוד השפה הפינית. ניתן לראות את לימודיו אלו כחלק מהתעוררות התנועה הרומנטית-לאומית בפינלד באותם ימים. הלכי רוח אלו היוו חלקים מכריעים ביצירותיו ודעותיו של סיבליוס.

יצירותיו הידועות ביותר הן "פינלנדיה", "וולס טריסטה", ה"קונצ'רטו לכינור", "הברבור מטואונלה" והסדרה הקרליאנית. הוא כתב יצירות רבות נוספות, כולל כאלו המושפעות מה"סימפוניות, מעל 100 שירים לשירה ופסנתר, מוזיקת רקע לשלושה עשר מחזות, אופרה ("''Jungfrun i tornet''", "העלמה במגדל"), מוזיקה קאמרית (כולל אחת עבור רביעיית מיתרים), מוזיקת פסנתר, 21 יצירות של שירי מקהלה, ומוזיקה טקסית של הבונים החופשיים.

==חייו האישיים==
סיבליוס סיים את לימודיו בבית הספר התיכון בשנת 1885. הוא החל לימודי משפטים באוניברסיטה בהלסינקי, אולם עד מהרה פרש מלימודיו. בין 1885 ל-1889 למד מוזיקה בבית הספר למוזיקה של הלסינקי (הנקרא כיום אקדמיית סיבליוס). מורהו היה מרטין וגאליוס. סיבליוס המשיך את לימודיו בברלין (בן 1889 ל-1890) ווינה (בין 1890 ל-1891).

יאן סיבליוס התחתן ביוני 1892. לו ולרעייתו נולדו שש בנות. בשנות ה-20 של המאה ה-20 חדל מלחבר יצירות.

סיבליוס מת בשל דימום מוחי ב-20 בספטמבר 1957.
==סגנונו המוזיקלי==
יאן סיבליוס היה חלק מתוך גל של מלחינים אשר קיבלו את נורמות הקומפוזיציה של פיוטר צ'ייקובסקי, אשר השפעתו ניכרת לדוגמה ביצירתו "סימפוניה מספר 1 ב-E מינור" מ-1899. יצירות של סיבליוס מתאפיינות בפיתוח של קטעים בתוכן בהדרגתיות עד לסיומן הגדול. המיזוג ביניהם הוא לעתים כה מרשים עד כי יש החושבים כי הוא נהג להתחיל את העבודה על יצירותיו דווקא מן האמירה הסופית שלהם.

עבודותיו הגדולות האחרונות היו הסימפוניות השישית והשביעית שלו, מוזיקת רקע למחזהו של שייקספיר, "הסערה", ו-"טפיולה" (Tapiola). סיבליוס צוטט כשאמר כי בעוד מלחינים אחרים נוהגים להגיש קוקטיילים, הוא מציע לציבור מים קרים וטהורים.

'''Johan Julius Christian''' "'''Jean'''" / "'''Janne'''" '''Sibelius''' (; Finnish Romantic period and one of the most notable composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His music played an important role in the formation of the Finnish national identity.

The core of Sibelius' oeuvre is his set of seven symphonies (or eight, if Kullervo is seen as a symphony). Like Beethoven, Sibelius used each one to develop further his own personal compositional style. These works continue to be performed frequently in the concert hall and are often recorded.

In addition to the Symphonies, Sibelius' best-known compositions include ''Finlandia'', ''Valse Triste'', the violin concerto, the ''The Swan of Tuonela'' (one of the four movements of the ''Masonic ritual music. Sibelius composed prolifically until the mid-1920s. However, soon after completing his Seventh Symphony (1924) and the Tapiola'' (1926), he produced no large scale works for the remaining thirty years of his life. Although he is reputed to have stopped composing, he did attempt to continue writing, including abortive attempts to compose an eighth symphony. He wrote some Masonic music and re-edited some earlier works during this last period of his life, and retained an active interest in new developments in music, although he did not always view modern music favorably.

==Life and work==
Sibelius was born into a Swedish-speaking family in Russian Grand Duchy of Finland, the son of Christian Gustaf Sibelius and Maria Charlotta Sibelius.  Although known as "Janne" to his family, during his student years he began using the French form of his name, "Jean", inspired by the business card of his seafaring uncle. In Finland he is known as Jean Sibelius.

Against the larger context of the rise of the Romantic Nationalism, his family decided to send him to a Finnish language school, and he attended The Hämeenlinna Normal-lycée from 1876 to 1885. Romantic Nationalism was to become a crucial element in Sibelius' artistic output and his politics.

After Sibelius graduated from high school in 1885, he began to study law at Aleksander's Imperial University in Helsinki. However, he was more interested in music than in law, and he soon quit his studies. From 1885 to 1889, Sibelius studied music in the Helsinki music school (now the Sibelius Academy). One of his teachers there was Martin Wegelius. Sibelius continued studying in Berlin (from 1889 to 1890) and in Vienna (from 1890 to 1891). 

Jean Sibelius married Aino Järnefelt (1871–1969) at Lake Tuusula, Järvenpää in 1903, and the two lived out the remainder of their lives there. They had six daughters: Iva, Ruth, Kirsti (who died at a very young age), Katarine, Margaret, and Heidi.

In 1911, Sibelius underwent a serious operation for suspected throat Fourth Symphony.

Sibelius loved nature, and the Finnish landscape often served as material for his music. He once said of his Sixth Symphony, "[It] always reminds me of the scent of the first snow." The forests surrounding Ainola are often said to have inspired his composition of ''Tapiola''. On the subject of Sibelius' ties to nature, one biographer of the composer, Erik Tawaststjerna, wrote the following:
 Vol. I, 1865–1905. ISBN 0-571-08832-5; Vol. II, 1904–1914. ISBN 0-571-08833-3</ref>}}

The year 1926 saw a sharp and lasting decline in Sibelius' output: after his Seventh Symphony, he only produced a few major works in the rest of his life. Arguably the two most significant were incidental music for Shakespeare's ''The Tempest'' and the tone poem ''Tapiola''. For nearly the last thirty years of his life, Sibelius even avoided talking about his music.

There is substantial evidence that Sibelius worked on an eighth numbered symphony. He promised the premiere of this symphony to Serge Koussevitzky in 1931 and 1932, and a London performance in 1933 under Basil Cameron was even advertised to the public. However, the only concrete evidence for the symphony's existence on paper is a 1933 bill for a fair copy of the first movement.<ref></ref> Sibelius had always been quite self-critical; he remarked to his close friends, "If I cannot write a better symphony than my Seventh, then it shall be my last."  Since no manuscript survives, sources consider it likely that Sibelius destroyed all traces of the score, probably in 1945, during which year he certainly consigned (in his wife's presence) a great many papers to the flames.<ref></ref> 

His 90th birthday, in 1955, was widely celebrated and both the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Sir Thomas Beecham gave special performances of his music in Finland. The orchestras and their conductors also met the composer at his home; a series of memorable photographs were taken to commemorate the occasions. Both Columbia Records and EMI released some of the pictures with albums of Sibelius' music. Beecham was honored by the Finnish government for his efforts to promote Sibelius both in the United Kingdom and in the United States.

Tawaststjerna also relayed an endearing anecdote regarding Sibelius' death:

In 1972, Sibelius' surviving daughters sold Ainola to the State of Finland. The Ministry of Education and the Sibelius Society opened it as a museum in 1974.

==Musical style== 
Like many of his contemporaries, Sibelius was initially enamored with the music of Wagner. A performance of ''Tannhäuser'', ''Lohengrin'', and ''Die Walküre'' intently. With this music in mind, Sibelius began work on an opera of his own, entitled ''Veneen luominen'' (''The Building of the Boat'').

However, his appreciation for Wagner waned and Sibelius ultimately rejected Wagner's ''Leitmotif'' compositional technique, considering it to be too deliberate and calculated. Departing from opera, he later used the musical material from the incomplete ''Veneen luominen'' in his ''Lemminkäinen Suite'' (1893).

More lasting influences included Tchaikovsky. Hints of Tchaikovsky's music are particularly evident in works such as Sibelius' First Symphony (1899) and his Violin Concerto (1905). Similarities to Bruckner are most strongly felt in the 'unmixed' timbral palette and sombre brass chorales of Sibelius' orchestration, as well as in the latter composer's fondness for pedal points and in the underlying slow pace of his music.

Sibelius progressively stripped away formal markers of sonata form in his work and, instead of contrasting multiple themes, he focused on the idea of continuously evolving cells and fragments culminating in a grand statement. His later works are remarkable for their sense of unbroken development, progressing by means of thematic permutations and derivations. The completeness and organic feel of this synthesis has prompted some to suggest that Sibelius began his works with their finished statement and worked backwards, although analyses showing these predominantly three- and four-note cells and melodic fragments as they are developed and expanded into the larger "themes" effectively prove the opposite.<ref>Pike</ref>

This self-contained structure stood in stark contrast to the symphonic style of Gustav Mahler, Sibelius' primary rival in symphonic composition. While thematic variation played a major role in the works of both composers, Mahler's style made use of disjunct, abruptly changing and contrasting themes, while Sibelius sought to slowly transform thematic elements. In November 1907 Mahler undertook a conducting tour of Finland, and the two composers had occasion to go on a lengthy walk together.  Sibelius later reported that during the walk:

{{cquote|I said that I admired [the symphony's] severity of style and the profound logic that created an inner connection between all the motifs... Mahler's opinion was just the reverse. 'No, a symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything.'<ref>
Burnett-James, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0711916837&id=0b7jnKpSrTEC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&ots=zVZtc5A0Xq&dq=%22It+must+embrace+everything%22+mahler+sibelius&sig=oDcPy4EhkarUsUlLUAOzglWOK0w p. 41]
</ref>}}

However, the two rivals did find common ground in their music. Like Mahler, Sibelius made frequent use both of folk music and of literature in the composition of his works. The Second Symphony's slow movement was sketched from the motive of ''Il Commendatore'' in ''Fourth Symphony combined work for a planned "Mountain" symphony with a tone poem based on tone poems based on Finnish poetry, beginning with the early ''Tapiola'' (1926), his last major composition.

Over time, he sought to use new chord patterns, including naked Fourth Symphony), and bare melodic structures to build long movements of music, in a manner similar to dissonances. Sibelius would often alternate melodic sections with blaring brass chords that would swell and fade away, or he would underpin his music with repeating figures which push against the melody and counter-melody.

Sibelius' melodies often feature powerful modal implications: for example much of the Sixth Symphony is in the (modern) tempi. He would often draw out one melody over a number of notes, while playing a different melody in shorter rhythm. For example, his Seventh Symphony comprises four movements without pause, where every important theme is in C major or C minor; the variation comes from the time and rhythm. His harmonic language was often restrained, even iconoclastic, compared to many of his contemporaries who were already experimenting with musical Modernism. As reported by Manchester Guardian'' newspaper in 1958, 

==Reception==
Because of its alleged conservatism, Sibelius' music is sometimes considered insufficiently complex, but he was immediately respected by even his more progressive peers. Later in life he was championed by critic Olin Downes, who wrote a biography, but he was attacked by composer-critic Virgil Thomson. 

Sibelius has sometimes been criticized as a reactionary or even incompetent figure in 20th century classical music. In 1938 If Sibelius is good, this invalidates the standards of musical quality that have persisted from [[J.S. Bach|Bach to Schoenberg: the richness of inter-connectedness, articulation, unity in diversity, the 'multi-faceted' in 'the one'.<ref>

</ref>  Despite the innovations of the tonal idiom. However, critics who have sought to re-evaluate Sibelius' music have cited its self-contained internal structure, which distills everything down to a few motivic ideas and then permits the music to grow organically, as evidence of a previously under-appreciated radical bent to his work. The severe nature of Sibelius' orchestration is often noted as representing a "Finnish" character, stripping away the superfluous from music.
Perhaps one reason Sibelius has attracted both the praise and the ire of critics is that in each of his seven symphonies he approached the basic problems of form, tonality, and architecture in unique, individual ways. On the one hand, his symphonic (and tonal) creativity was novel, but others thought that music should be taking a different route. Sibelius' response to criticism was dismissive: "Pay no attention to what critics say. No statue has ever been put up to a critic."
