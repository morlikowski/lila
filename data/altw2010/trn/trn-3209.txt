==Early years==
McMahon was born in née Russell) and Edward Leo McMahon, who was a fund-raiser and entertainer.<ref>http://www.filmreference.com/film/55/Ed-McMahon.html</ref> He was raised in Lowell, Massachusetts, and attended Boston College and The Catholic University of America, majoring in speech and drama. At The Catholic University of America, he joined the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1949.

McMahon began his career as a bingo caller in Maine when he was 15. Prior to working as the announcer, he worked as a carnival barker for three years as a teenager in Mexico, Maine, and put himself through college as a pitchman for vegetable slicers on the Atlantic City boardwalk.

His first broadcasting job was at Philadelphia, Concentration'' and ''Who Dunnit?,''

==Military service==
During World War II, McMahon was trained as a United States Marines fighter pilot and also served as a flight instructor and test pilot. He was discharged in 1946, remaining in the reserves.<ref>[http://www.gijobs.net/index.cfm?event=Columns&id=231&ri=31 Scott Baron. G.I. Jobs Online.  Accessed 2006-10-10]</ref>

After college, McMahon was re-activated into active Marine duty. He was sent to Korea in February 1953. He flew unarmed O-1E Bird Dogs on eighty-five tactical air control and artillery spotting missions. He remained in the Marine reserves, retiring with the rank of Brigadier General in the California Air National Guard.

Several of his ancestors, including the Marquis d'Equilly, also had long and distinguished military careers. Patrice MacMahon, duc de Magenta was a Marshal of armies in France, serving under Napoleon III, and later President. McMahon once asserted to Johnny Carson that mayonnaise was originally named ''Macmahonnaise'' in honor of this ancestor, referring to him as the Comte de MacMahon.<ref>[http://www.militarymuseum.org/McMahon.html M.L. Shettle, Jr., ''Ed McMahon: Marine Corps Aviator,'' California State Military Museum]</ref> In his autobiography, McMahon said that it was his father who told him of this relationship and he went on to suggest that he was not certain of the truth of the story.<ref>[http://www.hachettebookgroupusa.com/books/4/0446523704/chapter_excerpt365.html  For Laughing Out Loud, by David Fisher and Ed McMahon]</ref>

==Here's Johnny==
McMahon and Johnny Carson first worked together as announcer and host on the daytime gameshow ''Who Do You Trust?'' (1957-1962). McMahon and Carson left that to do ''The Tonight Show'' in 1962.  

For more than 30 years, McMahon introduced the ''Tonight Show'' with a drawn-out ''"Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeere's Johnny!"'' His booming voice and constant laughter earned him the nickname the ''Human Laugh Track''.

As part of the introductory patter to ''The Tonight Show'', McMahon would state his name out loud, pronouncing it as Ed "Mc MAH yon", such as the first two syllables of "Mayonnaise" (see above "MacMahonaise" story), but neither his long-time cohort Johnny Carson nor seemingly anyone else who interviewed him ever seemed to pick up on that subtlety, usually referring to him as Ed "Mc MAN".

The extroverted McMahon served as a counter to the notoriously shy Carson. Nonetheless, McMahon once told an interviewer that after his many decades as an emcee, he would still get "butterflies" in his stomach every time he would walk onto a stage, and would use that nervousness as a source of energy. 

Comedian Garry Shandling has stated in interviews that the relationship between fictional talk show host Larry Sanders and his side-kick Hank Kingsley in the hit sitcom ''The Larry Sanders Show'' is largely based on that between McMahon and Carson.

Musical comedy icon El Debarge's hit "Who's Johnny" entitled "Here's Johnny" about Ed McMahon and his signature catchphrase.  It appeared on his 1987 album Polka Party!

==Financial Status==
In March 2008, it was announced McMahon was recovering from a broken neck and two subsequent surgeries.  He was injured in 2007 in a fall.

In June 2008, it was announced that McMahon is $644,000 behind on payments on $4.8 million in mortgage loans and is fighting to avoid foreclosure on his multimillion-dollar Beverly Hills home.<ref>"Ed McMahon fighting foreclosure on his Beverly Hills home however holds deposits in offshore accounts unaccounted for." http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080604/ap_on_en_tv/people_ed_mcmahon  Accessed June 4, 2008.  </ref> McMahon has also been sued by Citibank for $180,000. http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hnRDS41TT3Iy0z4ISL2-0fOVA8pQD91E453O0.

'''Ed McMahon''' (1923- ) is een bekende Amerikaanse tv-Detroit. De jonge McMahon was gebiologeerd door het fenomeen radio en al op jeugdige leeftijd voerde hij 'radioshows' op in de voorkamer van het huis van zijn grootmoeder, een onbedoelde oefening voor de loopbaan die hem wachtte. 

McMahon begon zijn carrière op 15-jarige leeftijd toen hij 's zomers als verkoper groentesnijders aan de man bracht langs het strand. Al snel werd zijn gouden stemgeluid opgemerkt en had hij diverse programma's bij de lokale radio.

==Carrière==
Zijn grote bekendheid volgde pas eind jaren vijftig toen hij als omroeper werd aangenomen door NBC voor de spelshow Who Do You Trust, een programma gepresenteerd door de jonge komiek Johnny Carson. McMahon en Carson bleken een aanstekelijke chemie te hebben en al snel stond McMahon bekend als Carsons sidekick. Het duo bleef intact toen Carson in 1962 werd aangewezen als nieuwe presentator van het bekende en succesvolle NBC late night programma The Tonight Show.

Ed McMahon verwierf cultstatus door zijn traditionele introductie van Carson, elke avond tijdens de tune van de Tonight Show kondigde hij de presentator aan met een ongeëvenaard 'Heeeeeeeeeere's Johnny!' Deze uitspraak raakte al snel ingeburgerd en werd onlangs nog verkozen tot de nummer 1 TV-catchphrase door omroep TV-Land.
