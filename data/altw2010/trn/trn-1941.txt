'''날짜피임법'''은 피임법의 한 종류로, 생리 주기의 관찰을 통해 인간 여성의 임신 확률을 낮추기 위한 방법들을 말한다. 날짜피임법에 속하는 구체적인 방법으로는 '''리듬피임법'''과 '''표준일 피임법''' 등이 있다. 날짜피임법에 따라 생리 주기를 관찰하여 가임기에 성교를 피하면 임신을 방지할 수 있으나, 원할 경우 가임기에 집중적으로 성교를 가져 임신을 유도할 수도 있다.

날짜피임법이 처음으로 형식화된 것은 1930년 네덜란드의 로마 가톨릭 소속 의사 존 스멀더스(John Smulders)에 의해서였다. 이는 독일의 헤르만 크나우스와 일본의 오기노 규사쿠가 독립적으로 발견한 생리 주기에 대한 지식에 근거한 것으로, 리듬피임법 또는 '''크나우스-오기노법'''이라 불리기도 한다. 이는 증상에 기반한 가임성 관찰법이 퍼지기 전까지 수십년간 가톨릭 커플들 사이에서 널리 사용되었다. 그 뒤 1999년, 조지타운 대학교에서 표준일 피임법이 발명되면서 날짜피임법은 새로운 발전을 이루었다.

==역사==
===초기 시도===
여성의 가임기에 예측 가능한 주기가 있다는 것이 처음으로 발견된 때가 언제인지는 확실치 않다. 388년, 히포의 아우구스티누스는 마니교인들 사이에서 행해지는 주기적 금욕에 대해 다음과 같이 기록했다: "너희는 우리에게 여자가 정화한 뒤 언제에 가장 아이 갖기 쉬운지를 자세히 보라 하였고, 그 때에는 함께 지내지 말라 하지 않았느냐...?"<ref name="augustine"></ref>

초기 기독교의 교리는 완전한 금욕이야말로 인간의 가장 신성한 상태이며, 결혼이란 금욕을 행할 의지력이 부족한 이들을 위해 마련된 예외라고 보았다.<ref name="wife" /><ref>고린도1서 7.8-9, 32-35<br>
[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3010.htm cf. St. Jerome, Against Vigilantius]<br>
Council of Trent, [http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Valley/8920/churchcouncils/trent.htm Session 24]</ref> 마니교인들은 아이를 만드는 것은 언제나 부도덕한 일로, 인간의 육체로부터 영혼을 앗아간다고 믿었다. 아우구스티누스는 그들의 주기적 금욕에 대해 다음과 같이 비난했다: "이로 보건데 당신들은 결혼을 아이를 만들기 위한 것이 아닌 정욕을 만족시키기 위한 것으로 취급하고 있지 않은가."<ref name="augustine" />

한 서적에 따르면, 리듬 피임법은 "19세기 중반 이래로 몇몇 세속 사상가들에 의해 권장되어왔다."<ref name="wife"></ref> 임신을 피하기 위한 목적의 주기적 금욕에 대한 로마 가톨릭 교회의 기록된 첫 공식 입장 표명은 교황청 내사원의 1853년의 결정으로, 스스로의 의지로 주기적 금욕을 시작한 연인들은 특히 "합당한 이유"가 있는 경우, 죄를 짓는 것이 아니라고 하였다.<ref name="cmri"></ref>

1880년, 내사원은 1853년 결정을 재확인하고 여기에서 약간 더 나아갔다. 여기에서 내사원은 이미 인공적 피임법을 사용하고 있으며 이를 그만두도록 설득될 수 없는 연인들의 경우 고해 신부는 그들에게 주기적 금욕법을 '가르치기'를 권장했다.<ref name="cmri" />

==방법과 효과==
대부분의 생리 주기는 생리 직후의 비가임기(배란 전 안전기)가 지난 뒤 가임기(그 중간쯤에 배란이 일어난다)가 오며, 그 뒤에 다음 생리가 오기 전까지 다시 비가임기(배란 후 안전기)가 온다. 생리혈이 처음으로 발생하는 날을 생리 주기의 1일로 취급한다. 날짜피임법을 사용하기 위해서는 사용자의 생리 주기를 알고 있어야 한다.

'''Calendar-based methods''' are various methods of estimating a avoid pregnancy, by restricting unprotected intercourse to days identified as infertile.

The first formalized calendar-based method was developed in 1930 by John Smulders, a Roman Catholic physician from the Netherlands. It was based on knowledge of the menstrual cycle which was independently discovered by Hermann Knaus (Germany), and Kyusaku Ogino (Japan). This system was a main form of birth control available to Catholic couples for several decades, until the popularization of symptoms-based fertility awareness methods. A new development in calendar-based methods occurred in 1999, when Georgetown University introduced the Standard Days Method. The Standard Days Method is promoted in conjunction with a product called CycleBeads, a ring of colored beads which are meant to help the user keep track of her fertile and non-fertile days.

==Terminology==
Some sources may treat the terms ''rhythm method'' and ''fertility awareness'' as synonymous.<!--
 --><ref></ref>  However, fertility awareness is usually used as a broad term that includes tracking basal body temperature and cervical mucus as well as cycle length. The World Health Organization considers the rhythm method to be a specific type of calendar-based method, and calendar-based methods to be only one form of fertility awareness.<ref name="who"></ref>

More effective than calendar-based methods, systems of fertility awareness that track basal body temperature, cervical mucus, or both, are known as symptoms-based methods. Teachers of symptoms-based methods take care to distance their systems from the poor reputation of the rhythm method.<ref></ref> Many consider the rhythm method to have been obsolete for at least 20 years,<!--
 --><ref name="tcoyf"></ref> and some even exclude calendar-based methods from their definition of fertility awareness.<ref></ref>

Some sources may treat the terms ''rhythm method'' and ''natural family planning'' as synonymous.<!--
 --><ref></ref>  In the early twentieth century, the calendar-based method known as the ''rhythm method'' was promoted by members of the Roman Catholic Church as the only morally acceptable form of family planning. Methods accepted by this church are referred to as natural family planning (NFP): so at one time, the term "the rhythm method" was synonymous with NFP. Today, NFP is an umbrella term that includes symptoms-based fertility awareness methods and the lactational amenorrhea method as well as calendar-based methods such as rhythm.<!--
 --><ref></ref>  This overlap between uses of the terms "the rhythm method" and "natural family planning" may contribute to confusion. 

The term "the rhythm method" is sometimes used, in error, to describe the behavior of any people who have unprotected vaginal intercourse, yet wish to avoid pregnancy. 

==History==
===Early methods===
It is not known exactly when it was first discovered that women have predictable periods of fertility and infertility.  St. Augustine wrote in the year 388 of periodic abstinence practiced by the Manichaeans, "''Is it not you who used to counsel us to observe as much as possible the time when a woman, after her purification, is most likely to conceive, and to abstain from cohabitation at that time...?''"<!--
 --><ref name="augustine"></ref>

Early Christian doctrine considered complete sexual abstinence to be the most holy state for humans, with marriage being a holy state for those without the fortitude required by an abstinent life.<ref name="wife" /><ref>1 Corinthians 7.8-9, 32-35<br>
[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3010.htm cf. St. Jerome, Against Vigilantius]<br>
Council of Trent, [http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Valley/8920/churchcouncils/trent.htm Session 24]</ref> The Manichaeans (the group the early church father St. Augustine wrote of) believed that it was immoral to create any children, thus (by their belief system), trapping souls in mortal bodies. Augustine condemned them for their use of periodic abstinence: "''From this it follows that you consider marriage is not to procreate children, but to satiate lust.''"<ref name="augustine" /> 

One book states that "[The rhythm method] ''had been recommended... by a few secular thinkers since the mid-nineteenth century"''.<!--
 --><ref name="wife"></ref>  The Roman Catholic Church's first recorded official statement on periodic abstinence to avoid pregnancy is from 1853, where a ruling of the church's Sacred Penitentiary addressed the topic of periodic abstinence to avoid pregnancy. Distributed to confessors, the ruling stated that couples who had, on their own, begun the practicing of periodic abstinence—especially if they had "legitimate reasons"—were not sinning by doing so.<ref name="cmri"></ref> 

In 1880, the Sacred Penitentiary reaffirmed the 1853 ruling, and went slightly further. It suggested that, in cases where the couple was already practicing artificial birth control, and could not be dissuaded to cease attempting birth regulation, the confessor might morally ''teach'' them of periodic abstinence.<ref name="cmri" /> 

===Knaus-Ogino or rhythm method===
In 1905 Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde, a Dutch gynecologist, showed that women only ovulate once per menstrual cycle.<!--
 --><ref></ref>  In the 1920s, Kyusaku Ogino, a Japanese gynecologist, and Hermann Knaus, from Austria, working independently, each made the discovery that ovulation occurs about fourteen days before the next menstrual period.<!--
 --><ref name="singer"></ref>  Ogino used his discovery to develop a formula for use in aiding infertile women time intercourse to achieve pregnancy:<!-- This if from the Japanese article on Ogino (as best I could tell from the internet translator I used), but that page does not cite its sources -->

In 1930, John Smulders, a Roman Catholic physician from the Netherlands, used Knaus and Ogino's discoveries to create a method for ''avoiding'' pregnancy. Smulders published his work with the Dutch Roman Catholic medical association, and this was the official rhythm method promoted over the next several decades.<ref name="singer" /> While maintaining procreation as the primary function of intercourse, the December 1930 encyclical Casti Connubii by Pope Pius XI gave the highest form of recognition to a secondary—unitive—purpose of sexual intercourse. This encyclical stated that there was no moral stain associated with having marital intercourse at times when ''"new life cannot be brought forth."''  Although this referred primarily to conditions such as current pregnancy and menopause, the Sacred Penitentiary in yet another ruling in 1932,<!--
 --><ref name="lt"></ref> and the majority of Catholic theologians also interpreted it to allow moral use—for couples with "upright motives"—of the newly created Rhythm Method.<ref name="cmri" /><ref>Kippley, p.231</ref> In 1932 a Catholic physician published a book titled ''The Rhythm of Sterility and Fertility in Women'' describing the method,<ref name="wife" /> and the 1930s also saw the first U.S. Rhythm Clinic (founded by John Rock) to teach the method to Catholic couples.<!--
 --><ref></ref>  

Into the early twentieth century, it was believed by some Christians that the only licit reason for sexual intercourse was an attempt to create children.<ref name="wife" />  A minority of Catholic theologians continued to doubt the morality of periodic abstinence.<ref name="cmri" /> Some historians consider two speeches delivered by Pope Pius XII in 1951<!--
 --><ref>''Moral Questions Affecting Married Life'': Addresses given [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P511029.HTM October 29, 1951 to the Italian Catholic Union of midwives] and November 26, 1951 to the National Congress of the Family Front and the Association of Large Families, National Catholic Welfare Conference, Washington, DC.</ref> to be the first unequivocal acceptance of periodic abstinence by the Catholic Church.<ref name="wife" />

===Later 20th century to present===
Humanae Vitae, published in 1968 by Pope Paul VI, addressed a pastoral directive to scientists: "It is supremely desirable... that medical science should by the study of natural rhythms succeed in determining a sufficiently secure basis for the chaste limitation of offspring."  This is interpreted as favoring the then-new, more reliable symptoms-based fertility awareness methods over the rhythm method.  Many fertility awareness teachers consider the rhythm method to have been obsolete for at least 20 years,<!--
 --><ref name="tcoyf"> and calendar-based methods are not classified as NFP by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.<ref></ref>

In 1999, Georgetown University introduced the Standard Days Method.  Designed to be simpler to teach and use than the older rhythm method, the Standard Days Method is being successfully integrated into family planning programs worldwide.
