'''''The Green Mile''''' is a 1999 American 1996 The Green Mile''. The film stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb and Michael Clarke Duncan as the 6'10" giant John Coffey.

The movie is primarily about Edgecomb and his life as a metaphysical events upon the arrival of Coffey, a man convicted, but not proven, of murder.

In the 2000 Academy Awards, the movie was nominated for four awards (Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Picture, Best Sound, and Best Writing: Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published).

==Plot==
''The Green Mile '' is a story told in flashback by an elderly Paul Edgecomb (played by veteran actor execution are said to be walking "the last mile" here, on a stretch of green linoleum. The main feature of the cellblock was "Old Sparky", the electric chair.

One day, a new inmate arrives, John Coffey, a muscular 7 foot tall raping and killing two young Caucasian-American girls. Upon being escorted to his cell, he immediately demonstrates "gentle giant" character traits: keeping to himself, afraid of the dark, and being moved to tears on occasion. Soon enough, Coffey reveals extraordinary healing powers by healing Edgecomb's resurrecting a mouse. Later, he would heal the terminally ill wife of Warden Hal Moores (James Cromwell) who suffered from a brain tumour the size of a lemon. Although it is clear that Coffey has a degree of control over his power, when asked to explain it, he merely says that he "took it back."

At the same time, Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), a violent, sadistic, and potentially mentally ill guard who takes pleasure in intimidating and injuring inmates, exasperates everyone else in the cellblock. He "knows people, big people" (he is the nephew of the governor's wife), in effect preventing Edgecomb or anybody else from doing anything significant to curb his deviant behavior. Wetmore recognizes that the other officers greatly dislike him, and uses that to demand being promoted or to manage the next execution. After that, he promises, he will have himself transferred to an administrative post in the Briar Ridge mental hospital, and Edgecomb will never hear from him again.  A reluctant agreement is made, but Edgecomb comes to regret it after Wetmore deliberately sabotages the electrocution, inflicting as much pain as possible on Eduard "Del" Delacroix (Michael Jeter), a Cajun inmate who had previously embarrassed him (though even Percy is horrified by the gruesome spectacle of Del's death).

Meanwhile, a violent prisoner named William "Wild Bill" Wharton (catatonic state. Stunned by these events, Edgecomb queries Coffey, who says he "punished them bad men", then takes Edgecomb's hand and imparts the vision that he saw of what really happened to the girls, a vision that Edgecomb finds nearly unbearable to endure. Wild Bill is dead at Wetmore's hands, and Wetmore ends up as a patient at the very asylum to which he promised Edgecomb he would transfer.

Notwithstanding Coffey's incredible abilities and the wrongness of his conviction, he ends up being executed, due in large part to the racism prevalent at the time and place of the story (the movie was set in the Depression era in the southern United States). Another key factor was that Coffey was constantly depressed by all the pain in the world and "how people are always ugly to each other", describing it as "like glass shards in my head, driving me crazy." He therefore refuses to have the death sentence overturned. The proper story ends there, and Edgecomb says he subsequently transferred from Death Row to a 108 years old and still in excellent health. This is apparently a side effect of the life-giving power of Coffey's touch: a significantly lengthened lifespan. Mr. Jingles, Del's mouse resurrected by Coffey, is also still alive — but Paul believes his outliving all of his relatives and friends to be a punishment from God for having Coffey executed. Mr. Jingles, being a mouse, should only have had a maximum lifespan of 1 or 2 years, yet he has lived for over half a century, so Paul dreads to think how long he himself has left to live, being a human. As he puts it, he has deep thoughts about how "we each owe a death; there are no exceptions; but, oh God, sometimes the Green mile seems so long."  The possibility is implied that, at the time of the events leading up to his execution, Coffey was also very old, as Edgecomb is at the end of the movie.

==Characters==
===Paul Edgecomb===
The protagonist of the story, Paul Edgecomb, is the head corrections officer of a Louisiana Death Row during the 1930s. He narrates the story of his time on the Green Mile in flashbacks. Paul is cured of his urinary infection by John Coffey. Later Coffey shows Paul who the real killer of the girls is and as a result Paul is given the gift of life. He is at his wits' end with the conniving and abusive officer Percy Wetmore, and the vexatious "Wild Bill" Wharton.

===John Coffey===
Coffey is an enormous black man who arrives on the Mile for raping and killing two young girls. Despite the utter horror of the crime he allegedly committed, Coffey is favored by officers and inmates of the prison because of his incredibly gentle and kind nature, which also begins to make Edgecomb question Coffey's alleged guilt. Towards the end of the story it is revealed that he was innocent and that Wharton was the real perpetrator of the girls' rape and murder.  He is afraid of the dark, and his character is akin to one of an innocent child, making the crime he is accused of very unbelievable. He makes little effort to avoid being executed, because he finds it too difficult to live in a world that he considers to be unbearably cruel. Coffey has the supernatural ability to heal others, which he simply refers to as "taking it back". He makes a particularly strong impression on Edgecomb after he cures his urinary tract infection. In a biblical sense, he is a reflection of "Jesus Christ", given his initials ("JC"), his healing power, and his acute sense of the world's pain.

===Brutus "Brutal" Howell===
Second-in-charge of Cold Mountain's Death Row, Brutus Howell, often referred to as "Brutal" by the others, is Paul Edgecomb's closest friend.  Despite his intimidating name and imposingly large frame, Brutal is a calm, affable individual; but he does have a temper, which he mostly displays toward Wetmore. Like Edgecombe, Howell comes to accept that Coffey is obviously not guilty of murdering the two children.

===William "Wild Bill" Wharton===
William Wharton, who prefers to be known as "Billy the Kid", but is known to the inmates and officers as "Wild Bill", is an extremely hyperactive, mischievous and intimidating inmate — described by the warden as "a problem child". He serves as an antagonist, and was later revealed to be a deranged killer and rapist. According to John Coffey's vision when he made physical contact with Wharton, he worked on the farm where the two girls lived, abducted, raped and murdered them. Wharton is also racist; during the film he repeatedly uses the racial slur "nigger". Near the end, he is shot to death by Percy, to whom a disease was passed on by Coffey.

===Eduard Delacroix===
Eduard Delacroix, better known as "Del", is a fairly well-adjusted inmate who becomes a friend of John Coffey. Del discovers a mouse whom he names Mr. Jingles, who becomes his closest friend on death row. He and Wetmore despise each other. Del even laughs at Percy after he is attacked by Wharton. Wetmore later stomps on Mr. Jingles, "killing" it, but the mouse is healed by Coffey. Finally, Del's execution is sabotaged by Wetmore in order to inflict maximum pain on him. The electrocution becomes so extreme and inhumane that even the family of Delacroix's victims are horrified, as is Percy. Some would argue that his death is a reference to the first person ever to be electrocuted, William Kemmler. In the movie he is not killed outright, but takes a long time to die and even catches on fire, as did Kemmler.
