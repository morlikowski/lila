 (Persian: آیت‌الله سید علی حسینی خامنه‌ای, pronounced []) (born Supreme Leader of Iran since 1989 and before that was president of Iran from 1981 to 1989. 

==Early life==
Born to an Iranian Azeri<ref>http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=53543<br /> http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HF08Ak02.html<br /> http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FI28Ak01.html</ref> family in Mashhad,<ref>''Eternal Iran'', in 1721.

The son of a cleric,<ref name=vn>"[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/07/AR2007120701614_pf.html  Meet 'The Decider' of Tehran.

His younger brother, Hadi Khamenei, is a notable newspaper editor and cleric.<ref>Robin Wright, ''The Last Great Revolution: Turmoil and Transformation in Iran'', Alfred A. Knopf, 2000</ref>

He attended the seminary classes at the rudimentary (''"sat'h"'') and advanced (''"kharej"'') levels in the ''hawza'' of Mashhad, under his mentors such as Haj Sheikh Hashem Qazvini, and Ayatollah Milani, and then went to Najaf in 1957.<ref name=chamber>[http://www.iranchamber.com/history/akhamenei/ali_khamenei.php Historic Personalities of Iran: Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> After a short stay he left Najaf to Mashhad, and in 1958 he settled in Qom. Khamenei attended the classes of Ayatollahs Husain Borujerdi and Ruhollah Khomeini. Later, he was involved in the Islamic activities of 1963 which led to his arrest in the city of Birjand, in Southern Khorasan Province. Shortly thereafter, he was released and resumed teaching in Mashhad's religious schools and mosques, teaching the Nahj al-Balagheh.<ref name=chamber />

==Literary scholarship==
Khamenei has an educated-native-speaker's knowledge of Persian and Arabic<ref>[http://irannegah.com/Video.aspx?id=434 Khamenei sermon in Arabic]</ref>.  He has translated several books into Persian from Arabic like the works of the Egyptian Islamist extremist theoretician Sayyid Qutb.  He also has a lesser degree of understanding of the Azeri<ref>[http://irannegah.com/Video.aspx?id=423 Khamenei speaking Azeri about poetry]</ref> language and English.  

In Persian, he likes poetry.  In his analysis of the Persian poetry of Allameh Muhammad Iqbal, he states that "Iqbal was not acquainted with Persian idiom, as he spoke Urdu at home and talked to his friends in Urdu or English. He did not know the rules of Persian prose writing."<ref>[http://www.khamenei.de/books/iqbal.htm Iqbal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Nevertheless, he admires Iqbal.
 
Like many other politically active clerics at the time, Khamenei was far more involved with politics than religious scholarship.

==Political life and presidency==

Khamenei was a key figure in the Islamic revolution in Iran and a close confidant of Ayatollah Khomeini. 

Khomeini appointed Khamenei to the post of Tehran's Friday Prayer Leader in the autumn of 1979, after the resignation of Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri from the post. He served briefly as the Deputy Minister for Defence and as a supervisor of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards. Also he went to battlefield as a representative of defense commission of the parliament. In June 1981, Khamenei narrowly escaped an assassination attempt when a bomb, concealed in a tape recorder at a press conference, exploded beside him. He was permanently injured, losing the use of his right arm,<ref name=vn/>.

In 1981, after the assassination of Mohammad Ali Rajai, Khamenei was elected President of Iran by a landslide vote in the Iranian presidential election, October 1981 and became the first cleric to serve in the office. Ayatollah Khomeini had originally wanted to keep clerics out of the presidency, but this view was compromised.

In his presidential inaugural address Khamenei vowed to eliminate `deviation, liberalism, and American-influenced leftists.` <ref name="Sadjad">[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/sadjadpour_iran_final2.pdf Reading Khamenei by Karmin Sadjadpour ]</ref>  Vigorous opposition to the regime, including nonviolent and violent protest, assassinations, guerrilla activity and insurrections, was answered by state repression and terror in the early 1980s, both before and during Khamenei's presidency. Thousands of rank-and-file members of insurgent groups were executed, often by revolutionary courts. By 1982, the government announced that the courts would be reined in, although various political groups were repressed by the government in the first half of the decade.<ref>[http://www.iranchamber.com/history/islamic_revolution/revolution_and_iran_after1979_4.php]Iran Chamber Society Web site, Web page titled "History of Iran: Iran after the victory of 1979's revolution/ page 4", accessed December 9, 2007</ref> 

Khamenei helped lead the country during the long, bloody Iraq-Iran War in the 1980s, and developed close ties with the now-powerful Revolutionary Guards. As president, he had a reputation as a policy wonk deeply interested in military matters, budgets and administrative details.<ref name=vn/>

He was re-elected to a second term in 1985, capturing 85.66% of total votes.<ref>[http://www.khatami-museum.ir/jomhoori.htm : KHATAMI Museum :<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Iran hostage crisis===
During the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, Khamenei was shown on Iranian Television visiting at least one hostages to enquire whether they were "satisfied with residence, meal, hygiene?"<ref>[http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6a8_1211828701 Ayatollah Khamenei meets American hostage in Tehran, 1979]</ref>  Afterwards, he gave a press briefing to the media expressing his belief that the hostages were treated properly by their captors.

==Supreme Leader (Velāyat-e faqih)==

Seyyed Ali Khamene'i was preceded by Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of Islamic Revolution in Iran. When Khomeini died, Khamenei was elected as the new Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts on June 4, 1989.
Initially, a council of three members, "Ali Meshkini, Mousavi Ardabili and Khamenei", was proposed for Leadership. After rejection of a Leadership Council by the assembly, and lack of votes for Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Reza Golpaygani, Khamenei became the Supreme Leader by two third of the votes.<ref>[http://www.khobreganrahbari.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=76 خبرگان رهبری - رييس مجمع تشخيص مصلحت نظام: از مهمترين پيشرفت‌‏هاي واقعي انقلاب اسلامي، تأسيس سازماني براي ولايت فقيه بود[ايلنا&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <ref>http://www.iran57.com/Rafsanjani%20T%20dar%20sal%2068%20mokhalef%20rahbarie%20fardi'%20Ilna%2016%20Azar%201385.doc</ref>

The concept of an Islamic ruler superior to all national political figures or governmental organs is called Velayat e Faqih (guardianship of the jurist). It was first developed by Ayatollah Muhammad Naraqi<ref>[http://www.naraqi.com/eng/z/index_.htm Biography of Mullah Muhammad Naraqi]</ref> and expanded and revised by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. In this kind of theocratic leadership, no political decision is lawful until it is approved by the supreme leader (Vali e Faqih, ولی فقیه in Persian). Even the taking of office by the democratically elected president is subject to the approval of the Supreme Leader.

Khamenei transformed the position of supreme leader, bringing many of the powers of the presidency with him into the office, turning it into an "omnipotent overseer of Iran's political scene", according to Vali Nasr, a scholar of Shiism. Officials under Khamenei influence the country's various powerful institutions, including the parliament, the presidency, the judiciary, the Revolutionary Guards, the military, the intelligence services, the police agencies, the clerical elite, the Friday prayer leaders and much of the media, as well as various nongovernmental foundations, organizations, councils, seminaries and business groups.<ref name=vn/>

===Appointment as Supreme Leader===
At the time of Khomeini's death Khamenei was not a '' Archive Pages<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but the "political elite" of the Islamic Republic "rallied behind Khamenei" and his status was "elevated overnight" from [[Hojjat ol-Islam to Ayatollah. 

His status as marja is controversial. In 1994, after the death of Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Araki, the Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom declared Khamenei a new ''marja''. However, four of Iran's dissident grand ayatollahs declined to recognize Khamenei as a ''marja''.<ref name=globalsecurity>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/khamenei.htm Ayatollah Hojjat-ul-Islam Seyed Ali Khamenei<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Nevertheless, according to narjes.org a cleric only needs acceptance of a few grand ayatollahs to be recognized as ''marja''.<ref>[http://www.m-narjes.org/maaref/ahkam/tafkik/ahkam8.htm تکليف،تقليد و انتخاب مرجع تقليد براي بانوان<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Khamenei refused the offer of ''marja'iyat'' for Iran, as he explained, due to other heavy responsibilities, but agreed to be the ''marja'' for the Shi'as outside of Iran. His acceptance of ''marja'iyat'' for Shi'as outside Iran does not have traditional precedence in Shi'ism. ''Marja'iyat'' can be, and in modern times it increasingly is, transitional.<ref name=behrooz />

Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Shirazi, who was under house-arrest at the time for his opposition to Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, did not accept Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a ''marja''. According to "Human Rights in Iran" (2001) by Pace University's Reza Afshari, Shirazi was "indignant" over recognition of Khamenei as the Supreme Leader and a ''marja''. Shirazi (who died in late 2001) apparently favored a committee of Grand Ayatollahs to lead the country. Other ''marjas'' who questioned the legitimacy of Khamenei's ''marja'yat'' were dissident clerics: Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri, Grand Ayatollah Hassan Tabatabai-Qomi and Grand Ayatollah Yasubedin Rastegari.<ref name=globalsecurity />

====Political power following reform era====
According to Karim Sadjadpour of the American Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, several factors that have strengthened Khamemei in recent years: 
<blockquote>(1) A vast network of Islamic Revoutionary Guards, whose top leaders are directly appointed by Khamenei and have always been publicly deferential to him; (4) the political disengagement of Iran's young population ....; and (5) most significant[ly], the 2005 presidential election, which saw hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad trounce Khamenei's chief rival Hashemi Rafsanjani ...<ref name="Sadjad"/></blockquote>

==Political attitude==
In his speeches Khamenei consistently dwells on familiar themes of the 1979 revolution: the importance of justice, independence, self-sufficiency, and Islam; the need for resolute opposition to Israel and United States. <ref name="Sadjad"/> Dealing with the presidents who have served during his reign, Khamenei has successfully scuttled President Rafansjani's attempts to find a modus vivendi with the United States, President Khatami's aspirations for a more democratic Islamic state, and President Ahmadinejad's desire for confrontation. <ref name="Sadjad"/>

==Domestic policy==
Khamenei is widely regarded by some as the figurehead of the country's conservative establishment.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3018932.stm BBC NEWS | Middle East | Profile: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]</ref> 

Ali Khamenei has been supportive of scientific progress in Iran. He was among the first Islamic clerics to allow stem cell research and therapeutic cloning.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/08/22/iran_looks_to_science_as_source_of_pride]<br /> [http://www.channel4.com/news/special-reports/special-reports-storypage.jsp?id=1907 Science over ethics?] Channel 4, 8 Mar 2006</ref> In 2004, Khamenei said that the country's progress is dependent on investment in the field of science and technology. He also said that attaching a high status to scholars and scientists in society would help talents to flourish and science and technology to become domesticated, thus ensuring the country's progress and development.<ref>[http://www.khamenei.ir/EN/News/detail.jsp?id=20041031A]</ref>

In 2007, Khamenei requested that government officials speed up Iran's move towards economic privatization. Its last move towards such a goal was in 2004, when Article 44 of the constitution was overturned. Article 44 had decreed that Iran's core infrastructure should remain state-run. Khamenei also suggested that ownership rights should be protected in courts set up by the Justice Ministry; the hope was that this new protection would give a measure of security to and encourage private investment.<ref> [http://www.iranmania.com/News/ArticleView/Default.asp?NewsCode=49852&NewsKind=Current%20Affairs] <br />[http://www.payvand.com/news/07/feb/1254.html]<br />[http://www.tehrantimes.com/Description.asp?Da=2/20/2007&Cat=2&Num=019]</ref>

Additionally, Khamenei has stated that he believes in the importance of nuclear technology for civilian purposes because "oil and gas reserves cannot last forever."<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-02-18-voa3.cfm]<br />[http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSBLA82817120070218 Iran says will not halt uranium enrichment], Reuters 18 February 2007</ref>

In April 30 2008, Ali Khamenei backed President Ahmadinejad’s economic policy and said the West was struggling with more economic difficulties than Iran, with a "crisis" spreading from the United States to Europe, and inflation was a widespread problem. Iranian leader said that the ongoing economic crisis which has crippled the world has been unprecedented in the past 60 years. “This crisis has forced the UN to declare state of emergency for food shortages around the globe but foreign radios have focused on Iran to imply that the current price hikes and inflation in the country are the results of carelessness on the part of Iranian officials which of course is not true”, he said. Khamenei emphasized that no one has the right to blame Iranian government for Iran’s economic problems. He also advised people and the government to be content and avoid waste in order to solve economic problems. “I advise you to keep in your mind that this great nation is never afraid of economic sanctions”, he added.[http://in.reuters.com/article/asiaCompanyAndMarkets/idINDAH03115420080430?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0][http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/business/?id=25619][http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=167549][http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-236/0804304889163444.htm]

===Interpretation of Islamic law===

In 2000, Ali Khamenei sent a letter to the Iranian parliament forbidding the legislature from debating a revision of the Iranian press law. He wrote: "The present press law has succeeded to a point in preventing this big plague. The draft bill is not legitimate and in the interests of the system and the revolution."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/868244.stm BBC News | MIDDLE EAST | Punch-up over press law<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His use of "extra-legislative power" has been criticized widely by reformists and opposition groups. In reaction to the letter, some Parliament members voiced outrage and threatened to resign.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/08/07/iran.2.t_1.php Supreme Leader Backs Conservatives, Angering Parliament Refomers : Ayatollah Kills Effort To Remove Press Curbs - International Herald Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Kayhan and Jomhuri-ye Eslami are two newspapers published under the management of Khamenei.

In late 1996, following a fatwa by Khamenei stating that music education corrupts the minds of young children, many music schools were closed and music instruction to children under the age of 16 was banned by public establishments (although private instruction continued).<ref>[http://www.internews.org/visavis/BTVPagesInews/Persian_trad_music.html Beyond the Veil: Persian Traditional Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Khamenei stated: "The promotion of music [both traditional and Western] in schools is contrary to the goals and teachings of Islam, regardless of age and level of study".<ref>[http://www.irib.ir/occasions/Rahbar/further_fatwas.htm Great Ayatollah Sayed Ali Khamenei<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In July 2007, Khamenei criticized Iranian women's rights activists and the ''Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women'' (CEDAW): "In our country ... some activist women, and some men, have been trying to play with Islamic rules in order to match international conventions related to women," Khamenei said. "This is wrong."<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/05/africa/ME-GEN-Iran-Women-Rights.php Iran's supreme leader signals limited flexibility on women's rights]</ref> However, he is positive on reinterpreting Islamic law in a way that it is more favorable to women - but not by following Western conventions.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-6760059,00.html Iran Leader Signals Flexibility on Women]</ref> Khamenei made these comments two days after Iranian women's rights activist Delaram Ali was sentenced to 34 months of jail and 10 lashes by Iran's judiciary.<ref>[http://www.radiofarda.com/Article/2007/07/04/o1_khamenei-critisiz.html]</ref> Iran's judiciary works under the auspices of the supreme leader and is independent from the government.

With regard to women's dress, Khamenei believes in the need for compulsory hijab.<ref>http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCulture.asp?Page=/Culture/archive/200801/CUL20080114a.html</ref>

Khamenei claims that "Today, homosexuality is a major problem in the western world. They [western nations] however ignore it. But the reality is that homosexuality has become a serious challenge, pain and unsolvable problem for the intellectuals in the west."<ref>[http://www.khamenei.ir/FA/Speech/detail.jsp?id=860413A Official website of Iranian leader]</ref> Khamenei did not name these western intellectuals.

In 2007, Iranian police which acts under the control of Supreme leader, launched a "Public Security Plan": The police arrested dozens of "thugs" to increase public security. The arrested "thugs" are sometimes beaten on camera in front of neighborhood inhabitants, or forced to wear hanging watering cans used for lavatory ablutions around their necks.<ref>[http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/05/004660.php Thug” Crackdown Operation under Way in Iran (ROOZ :: English)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During the first three months of the campaign against women not adhering fully to the strict Islamic dress code, in Tehran alone 62,785 women were stopped by police, and of these 1,837 were arrested. In the first three months, police arrested in the capital more than 8,000 young "criminals" who have offended public morals.

The Islamic Republic has not yet allowed a single Sunni mosque to be built in Tehran; although President Mohammad Khatami promised during election time to build a Sunni mosque in Tehran. After he won the elections, he was reminded of his promise but he said that the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had not agreed to the proposal.<ref>[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/DL17Ak03.html Asia Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Ayatollah '''Seyyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei''' (øverste lederen i Iran.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei studerte Ayatollah Khomeini. Khamenei ble utnevnt til den mektige posten som Teherans fredagsbønneleder av Khomeini høsten 1979, etter at Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri trakk seg fra posten. I juni 1981 unnslapp Khamenei såvidt et bombeattentat, da en bombe som var skjult i en lydopptager ved en pressekonferanse, eksploderte ved siden av ham. Han mistet permanent noen funksjoner i sin høyre hånd, men hendelsen styrket hans rykte som en «levende martyr» blant sine tilhengere. 

Etter attentatet mot valget i oktober 1981 og ble den første geistlige som ble president. Khomeini hadde opprinnelig ønsket å holde geistlige borte fra presidentembedet, men endret syn. Mange så presidentskapet til Khamenei som et tegn på at Iran oppga gav avkall på ideen om sekulært styre.

Han ble gjenvalgt til en ny periode i ekspertrådet den 4. juni 1989. Siden Khamenei opprinnelig ikke ble regnet som en høytstående nok geistlig til å innta embetet, og det nye tillegget til grunnloven som tillot en geistlig på hans nivå til å bli øverste leder ikke var satt i verk, titulerte rådet ham internt som en midlertidig embetsinnehaver inntil den nye grunnloven ble satt i verk.

Ayatollah Khameneis periode som styrer har vært preget av utallige uenigheter med reformvennlige medlemmer av reformister har blitt hindret i å stille til valg av vokterrådet, hvis medlemmer er valgt direkte eller indirekte av Khamenei. I tilfellet med ''presseloven'', forberedt av reformistiske medlemmer av parlamentet for å lette presset på pressen, beordret han direkte ordstyreren i parlamentet, Mahdi Karrubi, å fjerne saken fra agendaen til Majlis. 

Khamenei, som var 14 år under Abadan-krisen (da USA hjalp til med å kaste statsminister Muhammed Mossadegh) fastholdt også en aggressiv holdning overfor Israel og USA (og muligens andre land som han kaller ved det generelle uttrykket ''fienden''). I senere år har der vært beskyldninger om at han har støttet et skjult program for utvikling av atomvåpen i Iran, som en respons til atommaktene Israel og USA.
