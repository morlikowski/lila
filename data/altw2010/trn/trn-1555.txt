'''Anton David Oliver''' (born French second-division club Toulon, recently noted for signing veteran greats including former All Blacks captain Marlborough (one of the predecessors to today's Tasman side) and Otago in the Highlanders in Super 14, and the All Blacks.

==Early life==
Oliver was born in Invercargill, New Zealand, and attended Marlborough Boys' College. He made his provinical debut for Marlborough against Nelson Bays in 1993. He also represented NZ Secondary schools and NZ Under 19s in 1993. In 1994, he represented NZ Under 19s and NZ Under 21s, and represented the Under 21s for the next two years.

He moved to Dunedin in 1994 to attend the University of Otago, and made his debut for Otago that year. As a student he flatted with fellow All Blacks Simon Maling and Tony Brown.

==All Blacks==
Oliver made his All Blacks debut age 21, versus Fiji in 1997. He has currently scored a total of 10 test points (2 tries). 

Oliver created the first father and son captain combination for the All Blacks when he was appointed as All Blacks captain in 2001. Father Frank Oliver captained the All Blacks in 1978 and was one of the hardmen of New Zealand rugby.

Anton was dropped from the All Blacks in 2003 after the test against England in Wellington 2003 by John Mitchell - the then All Black coach who cited a number of deficiencies in Anton's game as being the reason for his decision. He was a surprise recall to the team in 2004 for the end of the year tour reflecting a desire by the coaching staff for the All blacks to regain the forward power that so characterized the All black team of 95 - 97. From then until his retirement from international rugby after the 2007 Rugby World Cup, he was either the first choice hooker for the All Blacks or contending for first choice with Keven Mealamu.

Oliver evolved into a "thinking man's rugby player" and spoke openly on the excessive drinking that once took place in the All Blacks camp in his book "Anton Oliver, inside" (2005). In this book he speaks unashamedly of how a young fan's letter to him made him rethink his loutish drunken behaviour as a young man and he praises Wayne Smith and Andrew Martin for getting the All Black ethos back to "where it belongs". He is erudite and is always worth listening to if involved in a post-match interview - no trite "all credit to the opposition" comments to be expected from him.
