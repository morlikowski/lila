'''リオ・ギャヴィン・ファーディナンド'''（'''Rio Gavin FERDINAND''', 同国代表サッカー選手。

== 経歴 ==
若い頃から才能に恵まれ、1996年、17歳のときにウェストハム・ユナイテッドでプロ・デビューを果たす。活躍を認められ、2000年にリーズ・ユナイテッドへ移籍。2000-01シーズンのUEFAチャンピオンズリーグベスト4に大きく貢献する。その後、リーズの財政悪化により2002年に記録的な4,690万ユーロ（64億2,500万円）の移籍金でマンチェスター・ユナイテッドに移籍した。2004年、ドーピング検査拒否により8ヶ月の出場停止処分を受けた。

== プレースタイル ==
長身でヘディングには絶対の自信を持っている。ディフェンシブハーフも務まると言われるほど足元は巧く、そのロングフィードはしばしばカウンターの基点になっている。たまに軽い一面を見せることがあるが、読みが素晴らしくボールを奪いにいく場面と我慢する場面をよく熟知している。ディフェンスラインの統率力にも長け、攻撃に移る時のバランスもよい。圧倒的なスティール能力を武器に、コンタクトを極力抑える守備スタイルは特に評価すべきとこであろう。

集中力の欠如と己の過信による凡ミスさえ無くせば、アレッサンドロ・ネスタと並ぶDFと評される。

The final book value of Ferdinand's contract in Manchester United's accounts was £33 million.<ref>http://dps.twiihosting.net/manutd/doc/content/doc_10_139.pdf</ref> This included agents' fees, with Leeds receiving in the region of £30 million.

On Wigan Athletic, Ferdinand scored his first goal for United, en-route to a 4-0 victory. This was his first goal after more than three years at West Bromwich Albion. He then scored a last minute winner against Liverpool at Old Trafford, possibly his most important Manchester United goal to date. In the corresponding fixture in the following season on his brother held an informal competition on how many goals they could score during the 2005-06 season (neither being prolific goal scorers), which Rio won 3-2.

Following impressive and consistent performances in the league, Rio Ferdinand was named in the 2006&ndash;07 PFA Premiership Team of the Season alongside seven of his fellow Manchester United teammates.<ref></ref>

Ferdinand started the 07&ndash;08 season well, he was part of a United defence that managed to keep 6 clean sheets in a row in the Premier League, before conceding an early goal to Aston Villa at Dynamo Kyiv, with a superb header. United dominated the game and won 4-2.

On Newcastle United at Old Trafford.

In their FA Cup quarter-final match against Portsmouth on 8 March 2008 when Manchester United dominated, Ferdinand made a rare appearance as a goalkeeper, after Edwin van der Sar left the pitch with a groin injury and the replacement keeper, Tomasz Kuszczak, was sent off after conceding a penalty. Despite diving the right way, he was unable to save Sulley Muntari's spot kick, and Manchester United were eliminated from the FA Cup.<ref></ref>

On Middlesbrough, Ferdinand limped out of the match due to a foot injury. He was rated doubtful whether he would face A.S. Roma in the UEFA Champions League quarter-final second leg on 9 April 2008. He would play the full 90 minutes, though he received three stitches at half-time.<ref></ref>

Despite having been linked with a move to Barcelona, it was announced on £130,000 a week, which would keep him with United until 2013. The contract was finally signed on 15 May 2008.<ref></ref>

On Champions League Final victory versus Chelsea.<ref></ref> He accepted the trophy together with Ryan Giggs, as Giggs was the on field captain for most of the matches during that season during Gary Neville's absence due to injury.

===International career===
At the age of 19 years and 8 days, Ferdinand earned his first full England cap as a substitute in a friendly against Cameroon on 2002 and 2006 tournaments. Ferdinand has played ten World Cup matches for England, the team in these games have kept seven clean sheets and conceded just four goals whilst he was on the pitch (he was substituted before Sweden in the 2006 World Cup). On 25 March 2008, Ferdinand was named captain of England for the friendly against France on 26 March 2008.

The Rio" has been used in football chants both for and against Ferdinand; in fact, in 2002, fan Simon Le Bon (Duran Duran's lead singer) promised to re-record one of the football chants if the team won. However, the team failed to win and the promise never had the chance to come to fruition.

Ferdinand has scored two goals for England, the first in the Second round of the 2002 World Cup match against Denmark. The other was a near post strike that beat the Russian goalkeeper Euro 2008 qualifier against Russia on 12 September 2007 at Wembley Stadium.

On FA statement suggested that the decision to name Ferdinand as captain was part of Capello's plans of rotating the captaincy before naming an official captain for September's World Cup qualifiers.

===TV presenter===

In June 2006, on the day of the England national team's opening World Cup group match against Paraguay, Ferdinand made his debut appearance as a television presenter. Hosting 'Rio's World Cup Wind-Ups,' the England defender found himself in a Jeremy Beadle style role, playing tricks on his fellow England World Cup squad members including Wayne Rooney, David Beckham and Gary Neville. Several members of the squad were merked. A follow-up series was planned, entitled 'Rio's All-Star Wind-Ups', however this was cancelled following a number of filming disasters.[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a64694/ferdinands-prank-show-axed-by-itv.html]

It is also reported that Ferdinand is presently filming a documentary about the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor. Ferdinand grew up close to the estate where the 10-year-old was killed in 2000. The programme is the first in a series to be fronted by Ferdinand to persuade youngsters away from a life of crime. <ref>[http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17762336%26method=full%26siteid=62484%26headline=rio%2ddocu%2don%2ddami-name_page.html RIO DOCU ON DAMI - Sunday Mirror<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Controversy ==
=== Missed drug test ===
In 2003, he failed to attend a drug test, claiming he had forgotten because he was preoccupied with moving houses and instead went shopping. The FA Disciplinary Committee chaired by Euro 2004.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3333091.stm "Ferdinand banned for eight months"], BBC Sport, 19 December 2003</ref>
Manchester United appealed against the verdict and sought to draw parallels to the case of Manchester City player Christian Negouai, who was fined £2,000 for missing a test. However, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that such comparisons are inappropriate due to differences between the two cases. Negouai had been stuck in traffic and was willing to take the test, while Ferdinand was charged with "failure or refusal" to attend the test.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/motive-is-always-considered-in-deciding-guilt-576995.html "Motive is always considered in deciding guilt"], Independent, 18 December 2003</ref> Both the FA and FIFA sought to have the ban increased to 12 months (half the possible maximum).  In the end, the original verdict was upheld.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/3514462.stm Ferdinand ban upheld]</ref> Comparison may also be drawn with the case of Adrian Mutu, who tested positive for cocaine during a drugs test in September 2004, just nine months after Ferdinand began his suspension, yet received the lesser punishment of a seven month ban and a £20,000 fine.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3973219.stm "Mutu given seven-month suspension "], BBC Sport, 4 November 2004</ref>

===Driving offences===

Ferdinand has committed a string of driving offences and has been banned from driving on four separate occasions. In the most recent instance he was caught driving at an average speed of  and fined £1,500. Most famously he was convicted of drunk driving in 1997, forcing England manager Glenn Hoddle to drop him from a World Cup qualifier that would have been his international debut.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/4578495.stm BBC NEWS | England | Staffordshire | Rio Ferdinand banned for speeding<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Homophobic Remark===
In October 2006, Ferdinand caused controversy by calling faggot' live on air, just days after team-mate Paul Scholes was also in trouble for an alleged homophobic remark about him being gay with a funny hair do. Moyles jokingly asked Ferdinand: "If you had to, who would you rather go out with - Smudger or Scholesy?" referring to Alan Smith and Paul Scholes. Ferdinand replied: "That is not my bag that, that is not my game, talking about going out with geezers" and when Moyles suggested he would always prefer Smith, Ferdinand declared: "You’re a faggot." He quickly apologised for what he had said, stating "I'm not homophobic". <ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/oct/02/broadcasting.football</ref>
