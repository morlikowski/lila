thumb|225px|A [[Inglaterra saxona de acordo coa crónica saxona]]
Pobo xermánico que invadiu e emigrou á illa de Gran Bretaña no século V xunto cos anglos e os xutos. Fortemente emparentados cos anglos, debían ó seu nome ás armas que usaban, unhas espadas curvas chamadas ''sax''. Estaban fortemente relacionados cos anglos e os frisios.

Os saxons vivían daquela nunha área que comprendía dende o leste dos actuais Paises Baixos ata o itsmo da península de Xutlandia, abranguendo o que hoxe en día é o estado alemán de inglés.

Os saxóns que emigraron a Gran Bretaña estableceron tres reinos: Essex, Sussex e Wessex, este último o máis poderoso dos tres. Foron o pobo máis numeroso dos invasores, e tamén o máis cruel segundo as crónicas; créese que chegando a facer limpezas étnicas da poboación indixena britón-romana.

Os saxóns que ficaron en Alemaña foron sometidos por Carlomagno séculos despois, para logo ser un dos estados importantes do Sacro Imperio Romano-Xermánico, xa ocupando o ducado de Saxonia, que abranguía o actual estado de Saxonia.

The '''Saxons''' or '''Saxon people''' were a Old Germanic tribes. Their modern-day descendants in northern Dutch; and those in southern English. Their earliest known area of settlement is Northern Albingia, an area approximately that of modern Holstein.

Saxons participated in the Germanic settlement of Britain during and after the 5th century. It is unknown how many migrated from the continent to Britain though estimates for the total number of Germanic settlers vary between 10,000-200,000.<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/media/library/apartheidengland Germans set up an apartheid-like society in Britain<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Over the past two centuries or so, many continental Saxons settled other parts of the world, especially in German” and “Dutch”. 

Because of international Hanseatic trading routes and contingent migration during the Scandinavian and Baltic peoples, and also upon the Polabian and Pomeranian West Slavic peoples.

First mentioned by the Ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy, the pre-Christian settlement of the Saxon people originally covered an area a little more to the northwest, with parts of the southern Jutland peninsula, Old Saxony and small sections of the eastern Netherlands. During the 5th century AD, the Saxons were part of the people invading the Romano-British province of Britannia. One of these tribes was the Germanic Angles, whose name, taken together with that of the Saxons, led to the formation of the modern term, Anglo-Saxons.

==Continental Saxons==

===Name===
The word 'Saxon' is believed to be derived from the word knives. The Saxons were considered by Charlemagne's historian  Einhard<ref>''Vita Caroli'' c.7</ref> to be especially war-like and ferocious. 

===Saxony===
The Saxons appear to have consolidated themselves by the end of the 8th century, when a political entity called the Duchy of Saxony appears.

The Saxons long resisted both becoming Christians<ref>"they are much given to devil worship," Saints Ewald</ref> and being incorporated into the orbit of the Deutz on the conversion of the Saxon leaders and their people. Their sacred tree or pillar, a symbol of phallic<!-- possible but does not seem to have been studied yet -->, pagan, nature<!-- More accurately a fundament of their cosmology. Not "nature worship"; in that (e.g. sacred groves), natural locations were worshipped for their own right, with physical reality and spiritual interpretation being inseparable. The Irminsul was almost certainly of a purely symbolic nature, representing a "world-pillar" or "world-tree", and its physical nature and spiritual interpretation were entirely separate if the two or so contemporary sources (less than 20 words in total) that exist about it are to be believed. --> worship, Irminsul, was destroyed.

Under Carolingian rule, the Saxons were reduced to tributary status.  There is evidence that the Saxons, as well as Slavic tributaries such as the Henry I, the Fowler, 919) and later the first emperors (Henry's son, Frederick Barbarossa, into war in Lombardy.

During the Salian emperors, the Teutonic Knights and settlers, moved east along the river Elbe into the area of settlement of a western Slavic tribe, the Sorbs. The Sorbs were gradually Germanised. This region subsequently acquired the name Saxony through political circumstances, though it was initially called the March of Meissen. The rulers of Meissen acquired control of the Duchy of Saxony in 1423 and eventually applied the name ''Saxony'' to the whole of their kingdom. Since then, this part of eastern Germany has been referred to as Saxony (German: ''Sachsen''), a source of some misunderstanding about the original homeland of the Saxons, mostly in the present-day German state of Lower Saxony (German: ''Niedersachsen'').

===Balkans===

In the Middle Ages, groups of Saxon ore miners (called саси, ''sasi'' in the Upper Harz and Ivan Shishman.<ref></ref> It is thought that these miners established Germanic words and introduced new mining techniques and metal-working instruments to Bulgaria. Ethnic subgroups that are thought to be partially descended from these Saxons are the Banat Bulgarians and the Krashovani.

Saxons also mined ore in the Osogovo and Belasica mountains (between Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia<ref></ref>), as well as around Samokov<ref></ref> in Rila and in various parts of the Rhodopes<ref></ref><ref></ref> and around Etropole<ref></ref> (all in Bulgaria), but were assimilated without establishing Roman Catholicism there . 

The Saxons miners in Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina&mdash;active in Brskovo, Rudnik, Olovo, Novo Brdo and other places&mdash;also left a significant trace in the mining and metal-working history of the South Slavs.<ref></ref>

===Italy and Gaul===
In 569, some Saxons accompanied the Gallo-Roman General Embrun, joining up at Rhone by Mummolus. They were forced to pay compensation for what they had robbed before they could enter Austrasia. 

Some Saxons already lived in Gaul at that time. A Saxon king named Channel coast.<ref>Stenton, 12.</ref>

==Saxons in Britain==

Saxons, along with Roman authority in the west. Saxon raiders had been harassing the eastern and southern shores of Britannia for centuries before, prompting the construction of a string of coastal forts called the litora Saxonica or Saxon Shore, and many Saxons and other folk had been permitted to settle in these areas as farmers long before the end of Roman rule in Britannia. In 449, however, following a particularly devastating raid in the north from the Picts and their allies, the Romano-British administration invited two Jutish warlords &mdash; traditionally cited as  Hengist and Horsa &mdash; to occupy the isle of Thanet in north Kent and to act as mercenaries against the Picts at sea. After the Jutes had completed this mission defeating the Picts, they returned with demands for more lands. When this was rejected, they rose in revolt and provoked an insurrection amongst all the settled farming folk of Germanic stock with them.

Four separate Saxon realms emerged:
#East Saxons: created the Kingdom of Essex.
#Middle Saxons: created the province of Middlesex
#South Saxons: led by Aelle, created the Kingdom of Sussex
#West Saxons: led by Cerdic, created the Kingdom of Wessex 

During the period of the reigns from Egbert to Danish Viking invasions.

Historians are divided about what followed: some argue that the takeover of southern Great Britain by the Anglo-Saxons was peaceful. There is, however, only one known account from a native Briton who lived at this time (Gildas), and his description is of forced takeover:<blockquote>For the fire...spread from sea to sea, fed by the hands of our foes in the east, and did not cease, until, destroying the neighbouring towns and lands, it reached the other side of the island, and dipped its red and savage tongue in the western ocean. In these assaults...all the columns were levelled with the ground by the frequent strokes of the battering-ram, all the husbandmen routed, together with their bishops, priests, and people, whilst the sword gleamed, and the flames crackled around them on every side. Lamentable to behold, in the midst of the streets lay the tops of lofty towers, tumbled to the ground, stones of high walls, holy altars, fragments of human bodies, covered with livid clots of coagulated blood, looking as if they had been squeezed together in a press; and with no chance of being buried, save in the ruins of the houses, or in the ravening bellies of wild beasts and birds; with reverence be it spoken for their blessed souls, if, indeed, there were many found who were carried, at that time, into the high heaven by the holy angels... Some, therefore, of the miserable remnant, being taken in the mountains, were murdered in great numbers; others, constrained by famine, came and yielded themselves to be slaves for ever to their foes, running the risk of being instantly slain, which truly was the greatest favour that could be offered them: some others passed beyond the seas with loud lamentations instead of the voice of exhortation...Others, committing the safeguard of their lives, which were in continual jeopardy, to the mountains, precipices, thickly wooded forests, and to the rocks of the seas (albeit with trembling hearts), remained still in their country.</blockquote>

Wars between the native Britons of England either fled westwards or northwards or were progressively immersed into the new English culture, as the territory that they controlled gradually shrank in size to contain only Wales, Cornwall, north-westernmost England (Cumbria), and Strathclyde.  Some fled over the sea to Brittany, which was called after their old homeland, Britain.

Collectively, the Germanic settlers of Great Britain, mostly Saxons, Angles and Jutes, came to be called the Anglo-Saxons.
