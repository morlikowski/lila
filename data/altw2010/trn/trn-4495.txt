The '''National University of Singapore High School of Mathematics and Science''' is a prestigious, specialized independent High School Diploma, which is recognized by the universities. Advanced Placement examinations may allow students to get exemption from reading Year 1 university courses.

The school offers an accelerated language, co-curricular activities, in a modular system. It is the second specialized school in Singapore after the Singapore Sports School. 

==School Logo==
The logo is made up of a test tube, symbolising science, combined with the symbol for the unique number "pi", symbolising mathematics. A third element - the "sparkle" shows the dynamism of bringing the two disciplines together and the creativity that is to be found within the school. It is also representative of the six-faceted learning model that the school adopts.

The green colour symbolises growth and a nurturing environment, whilst the grey colour symbolises the solid base upon which the institution is built.

==Attire & Appearance==
===Uniform===
Students wear the formal attire, a white collared shirt and light green long trousers (male) or skirts (female), together with the school tie on Wednesdays, Assemblies, Public Speeches, school functions, and any events where the students represent the school. Student Leaders, on special occasions or school functions, and students who represent the school for any competition or events, may be required to don black blazers on top of the formal attire, together with black shoes (male) or low heels (female). On other days, students are allowed to wear their informal attire, a white polo shirt, together with either light green Bermudas or long trousers (male), or skorts (female).

===Badge===
Students must wear their badges prominently at all times. Student Leaders are given special Student Leader badge that indicates their Student Leadership Board below the school logo.

===PE Attire===
During physical education, students are required to wear the dry-fit dark green school PE shirt, together with shorts (male) or FBT shorts (female).

==Campus==
===Facilities & Features===
The NUS High campus sits on 4.67 hectares of land off Clementi Ave 1, a few minutes walk from the outskirts of the National University of Singapore. The school shifted operations there from its holding site at the former Raffles Junior College in Mount Sinai where it had held classes in 2005.

NUS received an Honour Award from US-based DesignShare Awards programme for the innovative design of its affiliated NUS High School. The award is given to projects that exemplify "best practice innovation from around the world in designing for the future of learning".

The campus comprises 11 science research labs, over eighty classrooms, and other facilities such as a 700-seat state-of-the-art auditorium, a 300-seat theatrette, an observatory, and the NUS High School Residence (Boarding School).

Amongst the range of research facilities available, NUS High School has a  Scanning electron microscope housed in a specialised air-conditioned science research lab called the "Dry Lab". Considering its high cost, it is rare for an institution of this size and level to have such a piece of equipment and as such it can only be accessed by teachers and students who are doing do their research experiments (AXIS Research Programme).

NUS High also has a specialised biology lab, called the "Wet Lab", where specific biology experiments and research are done there.

The campus has many publicised facades like the ''Periodic-Table'', as well as two twelve-storey blocks of hostels with an environmental and eco-garden features, a long and airy multi-purpose exhibition concourse, a student lounge, computer and iMac laboratories, a media resource room, and a thumb|right|300px|Clementi campus of the NUS High School of Mathematics and Science. The campus also has specialized art and music studios and CCA rooms, as well as facilities for the disabled.

NUS High School is currently undergoing an upgrading programme for the school's campus to enhance the teaching and learning environment of the school. Some of these upgrading works include improvement works for the NUS High School Residence (Boarding School); expansion of the current administration office; construction of new stores, CCA rooms, and Science Labs; construction of the 6th storey to include new Science Research Labs and Seminar Rooms; construction of more learning/self-study corners around the school; air-conditioning of the main Hall; and air-conditioning all the classrooms (To be completed by end of 2008).

Currently, 20 classrooms are fully air-conditioned, and the school had completed installing air-conditioning units in the hall on April 2008.

===Campus Security===
NUS High School adopts an open-based campus concept, which is like Universities and Junior Colleges where visitors are allowed to enter the campus with lesser scrutiny. But, security measures are still in place to ensure the safety of the students. The school's campus is protected by Certis Cisco security guards which are on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The school's main vehicular entrance has a barricade to stop all incoming vehicles for security inspection before allowing the vehicle further access into the campus. The main vehicular exit gate is automated and opens automatically only when a exiting vehicle approaches it. The school's side and rear gates (The rear gate is located near the canteen for access to bus stops at the back of the campus, and the side gate is located at the NUS High School Residence main vehicular entrance) are locked and secured by smart/proximity card readers and the gate is locked using electromagnetic locking mechanisms. Students and staff are required to utilise their personalized smart card (matriculation or staff card) to gain access through these gates, while residents utilize their NUS High School Residence resident's smart card as a form of authentication. The school's science research labs, theatrette, staff room/lounge, server/data centres all requires the appropriate staff's smart card in order to gain access. The administration office and library requires staff's smart card in order to gain access during non-school hours. The NUS High School Residence is secured using biometric (fingerprint) authentication in order to gain access into and out of the building.

==NUS High School Residence (Boarding School)==
The NUS High premises includes a boarding school (NUS High School Residence) consisting of 2 blocks or Residence Wing that can accommodate approximately 500 residents. The Residence is also open to scholars studying within or outside of the school. This hostel also serves as the site for the school's boarding programme. Students are required to live in the boarding school for their duration of their Year 5 academic study if they are not already living there. This is to inculcate independence in students and to allow them to devote more time into their research. Also, since the bulk of graduation research is done in Year 5, living in the boarding school cuts travelling time and costs, since students spend long hours in science laboratories. NUS High School Residence (Boarding School) boarding fees had been subsidized for NUS High School Year 5 students by MOE.

==Identification==
===Students===
All students of NUS High School are issued with a personalised matriculation card shortly after being admitted into the school, bearing the student's personal particulars. The matriculation card is required for student's personal identification within the campus and at any NUS campus. It is also being utilised for gaining access through the side/rear gates, into the school campus, NUS campus/NUS Libraries, NUS High School Residence, identification, etc. Student's are to ensure that they must have their matriculation card with them during their duration of presence within the campus.

===Staff===
All staff are issued a staff card in order to identify them, and to also allow them to gain access to places that are prohibited to students without prior permission or allowance. Staff are also issued an NUS staff card as well in order to allow them to enjoy full facilities at NUS.

===Residents===
All residents of NUS High School Residence are required to enroll their fingerprint at the NUS High School Residence Administration Office at their point of admission in order to allow them to gain access into and out of the NUS High School Residence building and lift lobby, and the gates to their own Residence Wing. They are also issued with a NUS High School Residence resident's smart card for access to the side and rear gates of the school's campus.

==NUSNET==
===School Network===
There is wireless and wired (LAN & NUS Secure Plug & Play Authentication) internet and network access coverage throughout the campus. NUS Computer Centre manages the school's main network. A fibre optic cable runs below ground to link the school to NUS. All students and staff are issued with an NUSNET network account for access to the school's internet/network resources and facilities. NUS wireless network access are secured by either LEAP encryption authentication or NUS Secure Plug & Play Authentication to prevent outsiders from gaining unauthorized access into the network. As an independent faculty of NUS, NUS High School students have full access to NUS IT and eLibrary resources as well.

===NUS Computer Centre IT Disaster Recovery Data Centre===
NUS Computer Centre also house their own IT Disaster Recovery Data Centre at NUS High School campus premises. Apart from being only acting as a IT Disaster Recovery Data Centre for data and network access for NUS and NUS High School networks in an event where the main data centres at NUS Computer Centre has problems, this Data Centre also act as a secondary NUS and NUS High School data centre. However, only NUS Computer Centre staff has access to this Data Centre.

==Curriculum==
===Academic Curriculum===

The curriculum of the NUS High School is built on a 2-2-2 structure, with the first two years being the Foundation Stage, the second two the Advancement Stage, and the final two the Specialization Stage. After each semester, students will be awarded a preliminary Cumulative Average Point (CAP) score based on their semestral results, with a final CAP score calculated at the end of every stage. 

Actual studies are based on a modular system similar to NUS, where core modules are compulsory, elective modules help deepen the student's knowledge and may be compulsory for a major in a particular subject, and enrichment modules are purely for the student's interests.

The school offers an accelerated curriculum of mathematics and science. Students are also exposed to humanities and the arts, where the flexible modular system allows for a sampling across this discipline. Ministry of Education's guidelines and curriculum, and the English curriculum teaches students practical skills such as reading, writing, and public speaking effectively.
