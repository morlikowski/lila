'''Islands''' est un groupe 2005 par deux anciens membres du défunt trio 2004.

==Personnel==
Islands fut fondé par le chanteur et guitariste Nick Diamonds (de son vrai nom Nicholas Thorburn) et par le batteur J'aime Tambeur (Jaime Thompson), tous deux anciens du groupe ''The Unicorns''.
S'ajoutèrent au groupe le bassiste Patrice Agbokou et le guitariste Jim Guthrie. Deux violoncellistes, Alex Chow et Sebastian Chow, ont par la suite rejoint la formation, ainsi qu'un clarinettiste, Patrick Grégoire. Tambeur annonça son départ du groupe le 28 mai 2006.

==Débuts==
'''Islands''' est lié aux vedettes locales Unicorns aux États-Unis avant de connaître un succès critique considérable avec leur album ''Funeral'', lancé en septembre 2004.

Richard Reed Parry, de The Arcade Fire, a travaillé à la production du premier album de '''Islands'''.

Nonobstant la notoriété locale déjà acquise au sein des Unicorns, '''Islands''' a pu se faire connaître sans même avoir d'enregistrements disponibles, en donnant plusieurs spectacles surprise à Montréal au cours de l'année 2005. En octobre, il a assuré la première partie de Beck au Centre Bell dans le cadre du festival Pop Montréal. Il s'est également produit avec les populaires groupes indie-rock canadiens Metric et Broken Social Scene. Quelques chansons ont été distribuées sur internet et '''Islands''' a pu bénéficier d'un support appréciable de l'influent webzine ''Pitchfork'' au cours de sa première année d'existence.

'''Islands''' is an indie rock band based in Montreal, Quebec, which currently records for Anti Records.

==History==
===''Return to the Sea''===
In mid-2005 Islands recorded a debut album titled ''Montreal, Canada, at Jamie Thompson's bedroom, and was produced by Mark Lawson.

Left to Right: Sarah Neufeld (violin, Arcade Fire), Nick Diamonds (Islands), Mark Lawson (audio engineer), Richard Parry (upright bass, Arcade Fire), Jamie Thompson (Islands), Becky Foon (cello, A Silver Mt. Zion and Esmerine).

''Return to the Sea'' was re-mastered in England for the European version of the album, and was released there by Rough Trade Records on April 3, 2006.  In North America, the album was released on the upstart label Equator Records on April 4, 2006. The cover of the album is one of Caspar David Friedrich's famous paintings, ''Sea of Ice''.

The album features numerous guest appearances, including members of Arcade Fire and Wolf Parade.  Two songs, "Flesh" and "Abominable Snow", were released to the public through The Simple Mission in June of 2004, though neither appeared on the debut album.  "Abominable Snow" had  begun life as a song played live by the Unicorns prior to their breakup, albeit under the title of "Abominable Snowman".

''Return to the Sea'' has been described by Nick as having "some calypso... It's more diverse and sprawling and ambitious" <ref>Jessica Suarez, [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/35071-ex-unicorns-spill-guts-about-breakup-new-band "Ex-Unicorns Spill Guts About Breakup, New Band"], ''Pitchfork Media'', August 26, 2005.</ref>, and is "A bit more mature than The Unicorns... More of a Neil Young / Brian Wilson vibe running through it."

The band played various shows around the US and Canada throughout mid-late Metric on their early Why? on the first half of the tour, and Cadence Weapon and Busdriver on the second. The band generally received critical acclaim for their live shows, which sometimes ended with the band leading the audience out of the venue "pied piper style" and onto the surrounding streets.

Positions in Islands consist of Nicholas Thorburn (main vocals, synthesizer, guitar), Aaron Harris (drums), Sebastian Chow (xylophone, violin), Alex Chow (synthesizer), Patrick Gregoire (guitar, saxophone) and Patrice Agbokou (bass guitar).

===Jamie Thompson's departure/European Tour===

On May 28, 2006, it was announced that Thompson would be leaving the band.  He stated, "I'm just not sure that being in a successful band is all that important to me anymore. I'm not leaving because of any problems with people in the band. It's very hard to do this, Nick and I have been creating together for quite a long time now... our relationship, both creative and personal is something that I will cherish for the rest of my life." Of Islands' future he said, "I think Islands is one of the best, if not the best band out there these days, and I have every confidence that they will do incredibly well." This quote was displayed on the band's website for only a short time, and was mysteriously taken down.  Islands decided to continue on without Thompson, and a European tour was scheduled, and further recordings confirmed. 

Diamonds commented upon Thompson's departure, saying "Jamie has left Islands, but the band waltzes on! We wish Jamie the best in his new life. Islands are forever."<ref>Amy Phillips, [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/36754-jaime-tambeur-quits-islands "J'Aime Tambeur Quits Islands"], ''Pitchfork Media'', May 30, 2006.</ref>

The band stayed relatively quiet in early and mid June following Jamie's departure from the band. However, in late June, with the European tour just weeks away, the band made two surprise appearances in Montreal, performing with a strikingly new lineup featuring new drummer Aaron Harris and new vocalist/violinist/percussionist Kate Perkins. Former touring guitarist Jim Guthrie was also noticeably absent from the band's roster.

The band departed for Europe the following week.

===Future plans===

Islands are currently on tour, this time visiting Iceland as well as the United States and Canada. They have premiered three songs: "The Arm", "Kids", and "We Swim". They have also played covers of T-Rex. Nick said in an interview that the song "I Feel Evil (Creepin' In)" will be on the album.
