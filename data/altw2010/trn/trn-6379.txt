'''Derrick Henry "Dick" Lehmer''' (number theorist, with he and his wife taking numerous types of work in the United States and abroad to support themselves during the Great Depression, fortuitously brought him into the center of research into early electronic computing.

==Early life==
Lehmer was born in Berkeley, California, to Derrick Norman Lehmer, a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, and Clara Eunice Mitchell. 

He studied physics and earned a Bachelor degree from UC Berkeley, and continued with graduate studies at the University of Chicago.

He and his father worked together on Lehmer sieves.

==Marriage==
During his studies at Berkeley, Lehmer met Emma Markovna Trotskaia (November 6,1906-May 7, 2007), a Russian student of his father's, who had begun with work toward an engineering degree but had subsequently switched focus to mathematics, earning her B.A. in 1928.  Later that same year, Lehmer married Emma and, following a tour of Northern California and a trip to Japan to meet Emma's family, they moved by car to Providence, Rhode Island, after Brown University offered him an instructorship.

==Career==
Lehmer received a Ph.D., both from Brown University, in 1929 and 1930, respectively; his wife obtained a Master's degree in 1930 as well, coaching mathematics to supplement the family income, while also helping her husband type his Ph.D. thesis, ''An Extended Theory of Lucas' Functions'', which he wrote under Jacob Tamarkin.

===Movements during the Depression===
Lehmer became a National Research Fellow, allowing him to take positions at the California Institute of Technology from 1930 to 1931 and at Stanford University from 1931 to 1932.  In the latter year, the couple's first child Laura was born.

After being awarded a second National Research Fellowship, the Lehmers moved on to Princeton, New Jersey between 1932 and 1934, where Dick spent a short time at the Institute for Advanced Study.

He worked at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania from 1934 until 1938. Their son Donald was born in 1934 while Dick and Emma were at Lehigh.
