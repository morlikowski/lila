'''Dundalk Football Club''' () is an Irish football club based in Dundalk, County Louth. The club currently play in the FAI First Division of the FAI League of Ireland. Founded in 1903, they are the second most successful team, in terms of trophies won, in the history of the League of Ireland. The traditional colours of the club are white jerseys with black shorts. Due to their white jerseys, they have been nicknamed '''the Lilywhites'''. They play their home games in Oriel Park, which has a capacity of 6,000.

A local rivalry is shared with Drogheda United.

==History==
The first newspaper reports of organised football in Leinster Senior League in 1900&ndash;01 for the first time. The club continued to exist (as the town’s most established club) until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.

However, other clubs also began to make their presence felt in the locality. One in particular, the '''Great Northern Railway Association Club''', otherwise known as the '''Dundalk GNR''', founded in September 1903, spawned the modern-day Dundalk Football Club. The Dundalk GNR were located at the political change at a national level was to effect this. Following the formation of the Football Association of the Irish Free State (FAIFS; later to become the Football Association of Ireland or FAI) in Dublin to govern football in the Irish Free State the control of footballing matters in Northern Ireland was left to the Irish Football Association (IFA). 

The Dundalk GNR were not involved in the fledgling Irish Free State Senior League (later to become the League of Ireland), which kicked off at the start of the 1921&ndash;22 season. It involved only capital to compete in the 1922&ndash;23 season. Their first game was played on Drumcondra; the two clubs that had headed the Dundalk GNR in their final season in the Leinster Senior League. Within four seasons, the club had moved from the Dundalk and District League, through the Leinster Senior League, and were ready to establish themselves in the elite Irish Free State Senior League, which included the likes of Shelbourne, Bohemians and War origins, travelled to Cork to face Fordsons in their opening match on 21 August 1926. The match ended in a 2&ndash;1 defeat.

The club were re-named Dundalk F.C. in 1930 and became the first provincial team to win the league title in 1932&ndash;33. The club has an unbroken membership of the League of Ireland, a record shared with only two other members from that time; Bohemians and Shamrock Rovers. The club moved to their current home venue, Celtic, Porto and Ireland and the League of Ireland. 

Since 1999, and in conjunction with Linfield of Belfast, the club has been engaged in a peace and reconciliation programme, known as the Dunfield Project, which through the medium of football is facilitating the coming together of young people from the Dundalk and Belfast communities. In 2002, the club won the FAI Cup for a ninth time. The club operated as a co-operative, with teams competing from school-boy level in Dublin-based leagues to girls and ladies teams, along with the first-team for a period until August 2006, when they were taken over by local business man Gerry Mathews. Dundalk celebrated their 2000th league game against Finn Harps on Thursday 8 March 2007 in Oriel Park. A crowd of 3000 turned up; a figure that is massive for the First division.

==2006 Promotion Controversy==
Despite the fact that Dundalk FC had won what they perceived to be or believed should have been the annual promotion/relegation Play-Off, and what would have been a promotion/relegation game in any other normal season, in November 2006, they were one of the teams omitted from the 2007 FAI Premier Division and were, instead, chosen to play in the FAI First Division. Dundalk, however, argued that they had a right to compete in the Premier Division following their Play-Off defeat of Waterford United. "What was the point of the league taking our players and fans all the way down to Waterford if it counted for nothing?", questioned one official even though they were one of the clubs to vote for the FAI's new proposals earlier in 2006. Dundalk's protests had no real weight, however, as the 2006 season's game had never been billed as a promotion/relegation fixture. Furthermore, the claim that the game counted for nothing was technically incorrect - the Play-Off's purpose was solely to decide which teams were to be positioned in 12th and 13th place within the overall season standings of all 21 clubs for the purpose of the IAG's process and their dispensing of assessment points, and thus, it did contribute points to Dundalk's final assessment tally. However, that was little consolation. The difference between the two positions of 12th and 13th was a mere point anyway, which in the grand scheme of things did not make a significant difference to the final decision of the IAG. Although the game did count for something, it counted for very little and verged on pointlessness. Meanwhile, Galway United, who finished the season in 3rd place behind Dundalk's 2nd were chosen for the Premier Division. This infuriated Dundalk fans and on 13 December 2006 a disgruntled fan protested the Independent Assessment Group's decision by entering the headquarters of the FAI in Dublin and dousing the reception area in petrol whilst threatening to set it alight. After about an hour the stand-off that developed ended peacefully. After a subsequent meeting with the FAI, Dundalk's CEO, Gerry Matthews, expressed his satisfaction with the process.

Dundalk's traditional colours are white jerseys (from which they get their nickname; the Lillywhites) and black shorts. However, this has not always been the case. Whilst playing under the auspices of the Great Northern Railway the club played in a black and amber-striped kit, right up until the GNR monicker was dropped and the team was renamed Dundalk F.C. in 1930. 

The club's crest features three mythical heraldic symbols of Dundalk town's coat of arms, which also depict red marlets on a predominantly white shield.<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/int/ier/d/dundalk.htm Dundalk], ''International Civic Heraldry'', 1996. Retrieved on 6 June 2007.</ref>

==Home Grounds==
The club played at the Athletic Grounds from 1903 until 1936, when they adopted Great Northern Brewery. The ground's attendance record is 21,000. This record was set in 1979 on the occasion of the club’s Celtic. The stadium, which now features a 1,600-seater stand, has hosted many memorable games for supporters including visits from Liverpool, Ajax and Red Star.

In February 2005, the club announced a major programme for a complete revamp of Oriel Park, which included the conversion of the pitch to an all-weather surface. Dundalk are the first Irish club to make such a conversion and the first club in the world to use the licensed FIFA 2-star surface for competitive league games. Further upgrades have taken place to the main stand, changing-areas and bar facilities. The ultimate aim is to restore the club’s standing amongst the premier clubs in Ireland. At the start of the 2007 season, fans of the club were delighted to see the developmental work done on the stadium over the close-season before the season's kick-off. A new roof was installed on the main stand and covered terracing was introduced along the opposite side of the pitch.

== Historia ==
Pierwsza prasowa wzmianka o zorganizowanym futbolu w mieście Dundalk pojawiła się w miejscowej gazecie pierwszej wojny światowej w 1914 roku.

Wkrótce zaczęły powstawać w okolicy nowe kluby, a wśród nich założony w sierpniu Football Association of the Irish Free State, w skrócie FAIFS, później przekształcona w FAI, czyli Football Association of Ireland). Dotychczasowa ogólnoirlandzka federacja piłkarska Irlandii Północnej.

Pierwszym sezonem pierwszej ligi niepodległej Irlandii (''Free State Senior League'', później ''League of Ireland'') był sezon Drumcondra. W ciągu zaledwie czterech sezonów klub zdołał awansować z ligi miasta Dundalk i okolic (''Dundalk and District League'') poprzez ''Leinster Senior League'' do najwyższej ligi Irlandii - '' Irish Free State Senior League'' w której grały wtedy Shelbourne, Bohemians i Shamrock Rovers. Klub, wciąż znany pod nazwą Dundalk GNR, na swój pierwszy pierwszoligowy mecz udał się do miasta Fordsons.

W roku 1930 klub zmienił nazwę na '''Dundalk Football Club''', która obowiązuje do dziś. W sezonie 1932/33 Dundalk pierwszy raz w swej historii zdobył tytuł mistrza Irlandii. Jest pierwszym klubem spoza Dublina, który zdobył mistrzostwo po odzyskaniu niepodległości. Dundalk wraz z Bohemians i Shamrock Rovers może poszczycić się najdłuższym nieprzerwanym okresem gry w I lidze. W 1936 roku klub przeniósł się na do dziś używany stadion Oriel Park. W latach 70. i 80. klub Dundalk popisał się serią pięciu meczów u siebie bez porażki w europejskich pucharach grając przeciwko takim zespołom jak PSV Eindhoven, Hajduk Split, Celtic Glasgow, FC Porto oraz Tottenham Hotspur. Klub zdobył 9 tytułów mistrzowskich, ponadto 9-krotnie zdobył Puchar Irlandii, oraz 5 razy był finalistą Pucharu Irlandii. Jest jednym z najbardziej utytułowanych klubów w swym kraju. Niemal stu piłkarzy grających w klubie Dundalk dostąpiło zaszczytu gry w reprezentacji narodowej Irlandii lub reprezentacji Ligi Irlandii.
