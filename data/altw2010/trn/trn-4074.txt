'''''Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital''''' is a thirteen-episode Lars von Trier's "The Kingdom" (aka Riget), which was developed by horror writer American ABC on March 3 and was scheduled to conclude on July 15, 2004. The show airing was put on hold during NBA playoffs half way through, but resumed airing on June 24, and concluded mid-August. 

==Plot summary==
The story tells of the fictional Kingdom Hospital located in Lewiston, Maine built on the site of a mill that manufactured military uniforms during the American Civil War. Subsequently, a hospital known as the "Old Kingdom" was built on the site but it burnt down. The current hospital is known as the "New Kingdom".  The hospital's "turbulent" nature seems to reflect its ominous logo, a crimson stylized dagger, predicting what will come.

A psychic named Mrs. Druse has checked into the hospital numerous times and is taken by the staff to be a giant anteater, whose long snout opens up to a horrifying set of teeth.

And elsewhere, Peter Rickman, a painter who is admitted to the hospital following a road accident (with severe injuries to his spine) begins to discover the ghastly goings-on while he lies comatose in room 426.

Other subplots included the initiation of arrogant chief of surgery Dr. Stegman into the secret society known as the 'Keepers', and the challenged-at-every-turn flirtation between young Dr. Elmer Traff and sleep doctor Lona Massingale.

The series is known for its tangential plots and characters who recur throughout, it is—as King called it—a "novelization for television".

While written as a mini-series, many fans wanted it to be renewed for a second season, and Stephen King himself had had a storyboard written out for one. Despite incredibly successful ratings for the first episode—making it the highest rating drama debut of the year on ABC—ratings sharply fell. The season averaged just over 5 million viewers per episode.

The entire miniseries is now available on DVD.
