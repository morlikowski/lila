== Geography ==

Đắk Lắk is based around the Đắk Lắk plateau, around six hundred metres above sea level.1

About 60 km south of Buon Ma Thuot is Lak Lake. Overlooking the lake is the old Summer residence of Emperor Bao Dai which has been renovated into a hotel. Surrounding the lake is Jun Village, home of the Jun people. The villagers have a peculiar form of fishing where they attach metal rods to a car battery and run the rods through the water zapping and stunning the fish and then collecting them to keep in a tank at the village until they are needed.

==Economy==

Coffee, fruit, and rubber play an important part in its economy. Recently, there have been efforts to harness the province's considerable potential for hydroelectric generation.
The Jun People take advantage of the small tourist trade that passes through, giving elephant rides through the village and across the lake.
