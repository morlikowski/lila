"'''Wishlist'''" is the second single from Yield'' (1998). It was released as a single on rearviewmirror: Greatest Hits 1991–2003''.

==Origin and recording==
"Wishlist" was written by frontman Eddie Vedder. Eddie Vedder about the song:
<blockquote>It was a stream-of-consciousness exercise. [Mike] McCready booked studio time in a tiny studio here with our friend Stu behind the board and another friend playing drums. We don't have the discipline to sit down and teach each other parts, so you're writing simple chord changes that someone else can follow without having to take breaks to learn them. It was probably eight minutes long originally. I listened to the tape and picked out the better wishes.<ref>[http://www.twofeetthick.com/tft/readArticle.action?id=62 Interview with Eddie Vedder]. Microsoft MusicCentral.  February 1998.</ref></blockquote>

==Lyrics==
The song is about singer Eddie Vedder seeking fulfillment of wishes desired, but resolves his wishlist with the line "I wish I was as fortunate, as fortunate as me." When asked about the song, Vedder stated, "I thought I'd lighten up."<ref>Macdonald, Patrick.

''The Seattle Times''. February 2, 1998.</ref> The line "I wish I was the full moon shining off your Camaro's hood" references the car that belonged to Beth Liebling, Vedder's wife at the time.<ref>Marsh, Dave.

==Release and reception==
It was released as a single with a B-side titled "U", which can also be found on the compilation ''Lost Dogs'' (2003). The song peaked at number 47 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and number six on the ''Billboard'' Mainstream Rock Tracks and ''Billboard'' Modern Rock Tracks charts.

Outside of the United States, the single was released in UK and peaked at number 48 on the Australian Singles Chart.

In his review of ''Yield'', Rob Sheffield of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine said, "The gentle power-pop nugget "Wishlist", a silly love song that Vedder composed solo, might be the simplest song Pearl Jam have ever done. But it's also the most moving."<ref>Sheffield, Rob. [http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pearljam/albums/album/205925/review/5945260/yield "Pearl Jam: ''Yield''"]. ''Rolling Stone''. March 11, 1998.</ref>

==Live performances==
The song was premiered live at the band's Santa Cruz, pearljam.com.</ref> The band played this song when it appeared on the ''Late Show with David Letterman'' in May 1998 in support of ''Yield''. In concert, the song is often extended with an extended, softly played, thoughtful outro jam, sometimes segueing into another song such as the Buzzcocks' "Why Can't I Touch It". Performances of "Wishlist" can be found on the DVDs ''Single Video Theory'', ''Touring Band 2000'', and ''Live at the Garden''.
