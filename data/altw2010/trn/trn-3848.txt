'''グレアム・チャップマン'''（またはグラハム・チャップマン）（'''Graham Chapman''', 1941年1月8日 - 1989年10月4日）は、イギリスのコメディアン、俳優。イギリスの代表的なコメディユニット、モンティ・パイソンのメンバー。

==来歴==
1941年1月8日、レスターにて、警官の父親ウォルターと母親のエディスの次男として生まれる。ケンブリッジ大学で医学を学びながら、コメディのスケッチ（コント）を書いていた。その後、学生時代の友人であったジョン・クリーズらと共にモンティ・パイソン（パイソンズ）を結成。

BBCで放映された『Monty Python's Flying Circus』（邦題: 空飛ぶモンティ・パイソン）は絶大なる人気を博した。同作のスケッチ、および同グループ製作の映画では主役を演じることが多かった。

;私生活
1970年代にはMonty Python's Life of Brian』では立ち直っている。しかし長年にわたる悪癖がそのころには体を蝕んでいた。当時のVTRや書籍などの中ではパイプを咥えている姿がよく見られる。

パイソンズのメンバーは気づいていたようだが、チャップマンは自分がゲイ（ホモセクシュアル）であることは公表していなかった。1972年に『Gay News』というゲイの新聞のサポーターとなり寄付や投書をした。

現代でこそ、ゲイ・バイセクシュアルであることを公にしている著名人も多いが、70年代にしてジョージ・メリー（ジャズミュージシャン）がホストを務めた番組でカミングアウトしたことは有名。その数日後に友人宅で開かれたパーティーにてデイビッド・シャーロックを自分のパートナーとして紹介。2人は1966年に出会っている。

『Flying Circus』のスケッチの中でチャップマンがローラースケートに乗った裸の女性集団から逃げて崖から落ちるというシーンがあるが、彼がゲイであったことを知っていると一層に面白い。

;その死
1989年10月4日、48歳の若さで死去。死因は喉頭癌とそれに伴う肺炎。彼の最期を看取ったのはパイソンズのメンバーだったジョン・クリーズとマイケル・ペイリン、パートナーのデイビッド・シャーロック、弟のジョンとその妻だった。テリー・ジョーンズとピーター・クックは同日見舞いには来ていた。人の死に目を見たことのなかったクリーズのショックは大きく、ほかの部屋まで付き添ってもらい休息しなければならない程だったと言われている。亡くなった日の翌日の10月5日は、奇しくも『Flying Circus』が放送されて20年目のことだった。

'''Graham Chapman''' (English comedian, actor, writer, physician and one of the six members of the Monty Python comedy troupe. He was also the lead actor in their two narrative films, playing King Arthur in ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' and the title character in ''Monty Python's Life of Brian''.

==Education and early performances==
Graham Chapman was educated at Melton Mowbray Grammar School and studied medicine at Barts Hospital Medical College, but never practised medicine professionally.

While at Cambridge, Chapman joined Cambridge Circus'', and took the revue to the West End in Broadway in September 1964. The revue appeared in October 1964 on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''.

==Writing for the BBC==
Chapman and Cleese wrote professionally for the David Frost, but also for Doctor in the House''. Chapman also co-wrote several episodes with Bernard McKenna and David Sherlock.

==''Monty Python's Flying Circus''==
left|thumb||Graham Chapman as The Colonel in ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''In 1969 Chapman and Cleese joined American artist Terry Gilliam for ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''. Cleese and Chapman's classic Python sketches include "Raymond Luxury Yacht", and "Dead Parrot". These were largely straight roles, but in the ''Flying Circus'', he had tended to specialise in characters closer to his own personality: outwardly calm, authoritative figures barely concealing a manic unpredictability.

In David Morgan's 1999 book ''Monty Python Speaks'', Cleese asserted that Chapman - although officially his co-writer for many of their sketches - contributed comparatively little in the way of direct writing. Rather, the Pythons have said that his biggest contribution in the writing room was an uncanny intuition as to what was funny. Although often small, his contributions were often the spice that gave the sketch its flavour. In the classic "Dead Parrot Sketch", written mostly by Cleese, the frustrated customer was initially trying to return a faulty toaster to a shop. Chapman would ask "How can we make this ''madder''?", and then came up with the idea that returning a dead parrot to a pet shop might make a more interesting subject than a toaster.

==After Python==
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: right|thumb||Graham Chapman as King Arthur in ''Monty Python & The Holy Grail'' -->In the late 1970s, Chapman moved to Los Angeles, where he guest-starred on many US television shows, including ''The Hollywood Squares'', ''Still Crazy Like a Fox'', and the NBC sketch series ''The Big Show''. Upon returning to England he became involved with the Dangerous Sports Club (an extreme sports club which introduced bungee jumping to a wide audience). He began a lengthy series of US college tours in the 1980s, where he would tell the audience anecdotes on Monty Python, the Dangerous Sports Club, Keith Moon, and other subjects. His memoir, ''A Liar's Autobiography'', was published in 1980 and, unusually for an autobiography, had five authors: Chapman, his partner David Sherlock, Alex Martin, David Yallop and Douglas Adams, who in 1977 was virtually unknown as a recent graduate fresh from Cambridge. Together they wrote a pilot for a TV series, ''Out of the Trees''; it was aired in 1975, but never became a series. They also wrote a show for Ringo Starr, which was never made. Adams was mentored by Chapman, but they later had a falling out and did not speak for several years.

Chapman's last project was to have been a TV series called ''Jake's Journey''. Although the pilot episode was made, there were difficulties selling the project. Following Chapman's death, there was no interest. Chapman was also to have played a guest role as a television presenter in the ''Red Dwarf'' episode “Timeslides”, but died before filming was to have started.

In the years since Chapman's death, despite the existence of the "Graham Chapman Archive", only a few of his projects have actually been released. One such that has, is a play entitled ''O Happy Day'', brought to life in 2000 by Dad's Garage Theatre Company in Atlanta, Georgia. Michael Palin and John Cleese assisted the theatre company in adapting the play. He also appeared in the Iron Maiden video, ''Can I Play with Madness''.

==Personal life==
In many ways, Chapman was the epitome of public-school respectability, a tall (6'2"), craggy pipe-smoker who enjoyed mountaineering and playing rugby. At the same time, he was proudly gay and highly eccentric (Douglas Adams remembered seeing Chapman in his local pub, casually whacking his penis against the bar to attract the attention of the bar staff).

Chapman was an alcoholic from his time in medical school. His drinking affected his performance on the TV recording set as well as on the set of ''Holy Grail'', where he suffered from withdrawal symptoms including delirium tremens. He finally stopped drinking on Boxing Day 1977, having just irritated the other Pythons with an outspoken (and drunken) interview with the ''New Musical Express''.

Chapman kept his came out on a chat show hosted by British jazz musician George Melly, becoming one of the first celebrities to do so. Several days later, he came out to a group of friends at a party held at his home in Belsize Park where he officially introduced them to his partner, David Sherlock, whom he had met in Ibiza in 1966. Chapman later told in his college tour that when he made his homosexuality public, a member of the television audience wrote to the Pythons to complain that she had heard a member of the team was gay, and said that the Bible said to have any man that lays with a man taken out and stoned. With fellow Pythons already aware of his sexual orientation, Eric Idle replied, "We've found out who it was and we've had him stoned." 

Chapman was a vocal spokesman for gay rights, and in 1972 he lent his support to the fledgling newspaper ''Gay News'', which publicly acknowledged his financial and editorial support by listing him as one of its "special friends".

Among Chapman's closest friends were Beatle Ringo Starr.

During his 'drinking days', Chapman jokingly referred to himself as the British actress Betty Marsden, possibly because of Marsden's oft-quoted desire to die with a glass of gin in her hand.
