'''麋竺'''(生卒年不詳)，字'''子仲'''，東海郡朐縣人，孙乾、簡雍同為蜀漢最高待遇的老臣子。

==生平==
牧陶謙辟他為別駕從事。

194年，陶謙病死，麋竺奉陶謙遺命，迎接在小沛的劉備入主徐州，並輔佐劉備。不久，呂布東來投靠劉備，但在196年，呂布乘劉備與袁術發生戰爭，偷襲下邳，並虜獲劉備的妻子。劉備惟有駐於廣陵海西。麋竺特意將妹妹嫁給劉備，又送二千下人和金銀貨帛以支助軍隊，對於面對危難的劉備重新振作。後來曹操想表麋竺為嬴郡太守，但麋竺與其弟麋芳都不接受，決意跟隨劉備。

劉備兵敗給曹操，向南投靠劉表，劉備先遣麋竺與劉表見面，與麋竺、孫乾同為從事中郎。214年，劉備入主益州，被拜為安漢將軍，地位在軍師將軍諸葛亮之上，其待遇為蜀漢眾臣中最高。可惜，其弟在關羽北伐時，叛蜀歸吳，令關羽被擒殺。麋竺自縛向劉備請罪，劉備反過來安慰他，認為弟之罪，兄不該相連，對他禮待如初。但麋竺反覺內疚而鬱病，一年多後就去世。

==特徵==
麋竺雍容大方，敦厚文雅。善於騎馬、射箭。但軍事不是其所長，未試過統御軍隊。但劉備一直待他以上賓之禮，對他十分尊敬。

'''Mi Zhu''' (? &ndash; Kingdom of Wu, directly resulting in the loss of Jingzhou (荊州, present day Hubei and Hunan) and the death of his superior Guan Yu. Mi Zhu was so ashamed that he fell sick and died shortly afterwards.

==Life==
A local of the county of Qu (胊, present day Linqu County, Shandong), Mi Zhu was born in an extremely rich merchant family. According to ''In Search of the Supernatural'' (搜神記) by Gan Bao (干竇), a work largely consisting of legends and hearsays, Mi Zhu was once returning home from the capital Luoyang when he met a lady by the road. He gave her a lift out of kindness. When she alighted, she revealed that she was an emissary from Heaven on a mission to burn down Mi Zhu's house. However, to repay his kindness, she agreed to walk slowly so as to allow Mi Zhu the time to evacuate the house. A huge fire indeed broke out at noon as the lady promised.

Legends aside, Mi Zhu initially served under Tao Qian (陶謙), governor of Xuzhou (徐州, present day northern Jiangsu). Upon his death, Tao Qian passed on the governorship to Liu Bei, to whom Mi Zhu thereafter rendered his service. In 196, Lü Bu stole Xiapi, capital of Xuzhou, and proclaimed himself the governor. Henceforth, Liu Bei was forced into exile, forming a series of temporary alliances with different warlords, including Cao Cao, Yuan Shao and Liu Biao. Throughout this trough in Liu Bei's career, however, Mi Zhu stayed loyal. When Liu Bei was decisively defeated by Lu Bu, Mi Fang sponsored Liu Bei with his all of his family wealth and also married his younger sister to the latter. Cao Cao had once attempted to entice Mi Zhu and Mi Fang to defect by offering them governorships of Ying Commandery (嬴郡, northwest of present day Laiwu, Shandong) and Pengcheng respectively but was turned down, and both brothers fled with Liu Bei.

After Liu Bei conquered Yizhou (益州, present day central Sichuan and Guizhou) in 215, Mi Zhu was promoted to '''General Who Maintains Peace of Han''' (安漢將軍). Although he was not given any troops to command, as military manoeuvrer were not his expertise, he was nonetheless the most highly esteemed among Liu Bei's subjects.

In 219, Mi Fang surrendered to the forces of Shu's chief commander Guan Yu. Mi Zhu bound himself and came to Liu Bei, pleading guilty for his brother's crime. Although Liu Bei did not fault him, Mi Zhu was so ashamed that he soon fell sick and died within the year.
