'''''X''''' is a 2007 album by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue. It is her tenth studio album release, her first release since 2004's greatest hits compilation ''Ultimate Kylie'', and her first studio album since 2003's ''Body Language''. ''X'' was preceded by lead single "2 Hearts" and released worldwide in November 2007. The North American release of ''X'' came in April 2008, preceded by the single "All I See".  

Work on the album began following Minogue's gradual recovery from resumed the tour in late 2006, in the midst of recording ''X'', and was completed later in the following year.

Despite mixed critical reception, ''X'' was nominated for a Metro'', as of April 2008, ''X'' had sold "nearly one million copies worldwide".<ref></ref>

==Recording the album==

While recovering in Melbourne, Minogue began writing lyrics towards the end of her cancer treatment in mid-2006, having not worked on any music for the previous year. Inspired by thinking about the things Minogue wanted to do once her recovery was complete and of her doubts about returning to her career; she wrote lyrics which would later form the basis of “Cosmic” and “No More Rain”.

Due to the recovery time following her cancer, ''X'' was the first album Kylie had consciously prepared for the recording of, having previously been engaged for much of her career in an endless cycle of record, release and tour. She had worried about not having sung in some time and whether or not she could perform so soon after her cancer treatment. Minogue started work on the project in May 2006, only breaking for the resumption of the ''Showgirl'' tour at the end of the year.  Once the tour was finished, she returned to the studio to complete the album, feeling that completing it was a personal goal she had set.

Initial sessions in In My Arms", while Stannard brought in a track he’d sourced titled "The One", which he co-produced with Russell Small and James Wiltshire of Freemasons. Stannard also worked with Stuart Crichton on "Tell It Like It Is", Dave Morgan ("Simple Boy"), Rob Davis ("One To One"), Martin Harrington, Ash Howes and Hanna Robinson ("Give Up To Love").

Once the sessions for the album had gotten underway, Parlophone’s A&R team sent out writing and production briefs to a large number of artists, producers and songwriters, some of them well regarded, some up-and-coming and some unknown, requesting demo submissions for Minogue and her team to hear. Minogue continued to work with a growing number of artists on her new material. Harris returned to the project with "Heart Beat Rock", sessions with Scottish musician Mylo resulted in "I’m In The Mood For Love" and "Spell of Desire" while underground London group Kish Mauve produced two of their own songs for Minogue, "2 Hearts" and "Lose Control". Boy George and Amanda Ghost submitted a track called "I’m Ready", with further submissions coming from Rob Davis ("Excuse My French"), Hannah Robinson ("When The Cat’s Away" and "So Safe"), Henrik Korpi ("Never Be Lonely"), Siobhan Fahey, Goldfrapp, Sneaky Sound System, Daft Punk, Hot Chip and Alan Braxe.

Minogue’s material took a harder electronic approach with some of her newer collaborators. Danish producers Mich Hedin Hansen,and Jonas Jeberg forwarded a demo of "Like A Drug" to Parlophone, which was rejected at first but accepted on second try. Minogue recorded the track in London, and later she recorded "All I See",( Written by EMI songwriter Edwin "Lil Eddie" Serrano) "Down Down" and "Rippin’ Up The Disco" with them. Sessions in Stockholm with songwriter Karen Poole and Swedish producers Bloodshy & Avant resulted in tracks "Speakerphone", "Cherry Bomb" and "Nu-Di-Ty". Minogue brought out her lyric book and attempted to work on "No More Rain" with them, but their production heavy style did not work well with the song.

Minogue requested setting up a studio in Ibiza with previous writing partner Karen Poole, and newcomer to the fold Greg Kurstin, an American multi-instrumentalist musician/producer. Once there they wrote "Wow", "King or Queen", "Deepest Blue", "Carried Away", "Do It Again", and "Magnetic Electric". Minogue gave "No More Rain" to Kurstin to complete a new production on the song. Poole also worked on a track with Soul Mechanics entitled "My Love Is Real".  

A few more tracks completed rounded off the album’s sessions. Minogue recorded a cover of Roxy Music’s "Love Is The Drug" with Calvin Harris, and completed "Cosmic" with producer Eg White. Minogue encountered songwriter Guy Chambers at a function, who offered her a song he’d written over the previous four years and built around a sample of Serge Gainsbourg’s "Bonnie et Clyde". Cathy Dennis joined Minogue in furthering the track, which became "Sensitized". She had also written a number of songs for Minogue’s album, including one co-written with producer Mark Ronson entitled "Boys Boys Boys", which was later passed down to American pop starlet, Ashlee Simpson and retitled, "Boys". Minogue also completed a number of tracks with her longtime writing partner Steve Anderson of Brothers In Rhythm; those tracks included "Hush Hush", "Flower" and "That's Why They Write Love Songs".

'''X''' ist das zehnte Studioalbum der australischen Popsängerin Kylie Minogue. Das Album ist Minogues erstes Studioalbum seit ihrer Brustkrebserkrankung im Mai 2005. 

== Hintergrund == 

Für die Aufnahmen zu ihrem zehnten Studioalbum arbeitete  Kylie Minogue neben den ihr vertrauten Produzenten wie elektronischen Tanzmusik zusammen, darunter unter anderem mit Groove Armada, Mylo und Calvin Harris<ref> [http://www.spex.de/weblog/archives/4806-Kylie-Neues-Album,-Features-fuer-Mylo,-MP3s.html „Kylie - Neues Album, Features für Mylo“]In: [http://www.spex.de Spex]</ref>. Allerdings fanden von den mehr als 40 Demoaufnahmen nur 13 Songs den Weg auf das reguläre Album, wodurch Kollaborationen mit Groove Armada, Mylo und den Scissor Sisters nicht offiziell veröffentlicht wurden. Minogue selbst war an insgesamt sieben Songs als Komponistin beteiligt. Drei Songs des Albums, ''In My Arms'', ''Stars'' und ''Sensitized'',  tauchten neben weiteren Demos bereits im Mai 2007 illegal im Internet auf. 

Zu Promotionszwecken produzierte Minogue „The Kylie Show“, die im November 2007 im britischen TV ausgestrahlt wurde. Seit Mai 2008 präsentiert Kylie Minogue ihr zehntes Studioalbum auf der KylieX2008-Tour.

== Stil == 

Bis auf das als Vorabsingle ausgekoppelte ''2 Hearts'', das durch Glamrock-Einflüsse besticht, und die Balladen ''No more Rain'' und ''Cosmic'', ist das Gros von X vor allem tanzbare Popmusik. ''Sensitized'' basiert hingegen auf einem Sample des Songs ''Bonnie and Clyde'' von Body Language, durch zeitgenössischen R'n'B beeinflusst.

== Auszeichnungen ==

Für ''X'' erhielt Minogue eine Brit Awards-Nominierung in der Kategorie "International Album".
Bei der 43. Verleihung der Goldenen Kamera wurde Minogue für ''X'' in der Sparte «Musik international» ausgezeichnet werden. In der Begründung der Jury heißt es: «"X" – schnell, klar, hart und rein – markiert den Eintritt in eine neue Lebensphase, eine bewusstere, eine, in der die Australierin endlich selbst über ihre eigenen Kräfte bestimmen kann. Die Frau, die seit den 80er-Jahren Inbegriff der Pop-Musik ist, hat sich ein weiteres Mal in ihrer langen Karriere verwandelt. Es ist mit Sicherheit die wichtigste und die erwachsenste Verwandlung. Nur so konnte ihr dieses fulminante Comeback gelingen.»<ref>[http://www.goldenekamera.de/].In: [http://www.Goldene Kamera.de Goldene Kamera.de]</ref>
