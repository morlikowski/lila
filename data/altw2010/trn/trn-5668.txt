L<nowiki>'</nowiki>'''''Australopithecus africanus''''' è una specie di ominidi del genere ''Australopithecus''.

Molto prima che Donald Johanson e Meave Leakey incominciassero la loro opera di paleoantropologi in Africa, Raymond Dart e Robert Broom avevano scoperto la specie di ominidi nota come ''Australopithecus africanus''.

La prima scoperta fu fatta nel scimmie. La posizione più avanzata del anni Quaranta, quando vennero scoperti fossili simili.

Nel 1936 Robert Broom rinvenne a Sterkfontein il secondo fossile di questa specie. La scoperta consisteva in parte delle ossa del volto, della mascella superiore e frammenti della scatola cranica. Questo esemplare prima di essere riconosciuto come ''Australopithecus africanus'' venne chiamato ''Plesianthoropus transvaalensis'' ossia "prossimo all'uomo".

'''''Australopithecus africanus''''' was an early hominid, an Gladysvale (1992).<ref name="info">[http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/australopithecusafricanus.htm Australopithecus africanus<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Famous fossils==
===Taung Child===

Kimberley, lime worker.<ref>[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/284158_brain.html Raymond Dart and our African origins<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The skull seemed like an odd ape creature sharing human traits such as eye orbits, teeth, and, most importantly, the hole at the base of the skull over the spinal column (the foramen magnum) indicating a human-like posture. Dart assigned the specimen the name ''Australopithecus africanus'' ("southern ape of Africa"). This was the first time the word ''Australopithecus'' was assigned to any hominid. Dart claimed that the skull must have been an intermediate species between ape and humans, but his claim about the Taung Child was rejected by the scientific community at the time due to the belief that a large cranial capacity must precede bipedal locomotion,<ref name="info"/> this was exacerbated by the widespread acceptance of the Piltdown Man. Sir Arthur Keith, a fellow anatomist and anthropologist, suggested that the skull belonged to a young ape, most likely from an infant gorilla.

===Mrs. Ples===

Dart's theory was supported by Robert Broom.<ref name="info2">[http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/walker/classes/anth121/121australopithecus.pdf Primate Origins<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1938 Broom classified an adult endocranial cast having a brain capacity of 485&nbsp;cc, which had been found by G. W. Barlow, as ''Plesianthropus transvaalensis''. On April 17, 1947, Broom and John T. Robinson discovered a skull belonging to a middle-aged female,<ref>[http://archaeology.about.com/od/rterms/g/robinsonjt.htm John T. Robinson<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Sts 5, while blasting at Sterkfontein. Broom classified it also as ''Plesianthropus transvaalensis'', and it was dubbed Mrs. Ples by the press (though the skull is now thought to have belonged to a young male). The lack of facial projection in comparison to apes was noted by Raymond Dart (including from Taung Child), a trait in common with more advanced hominines. Both fossils were later classified as ''A. africanus''.

==Morphology and interpretations==
Like ''A. afarensis'', ''A. africanus'' the South African counterpart was generally similar in many traits, a bipedal hominin with arms slightly larger than the legs (a physical trait also found in chimpanzees). Despite its slightly more human-like cranial features, seen for example in the craniums ''Mr. Ples'' and ''Sts 71'', other more primitive features including ape-like curved fingers for tree climbing are also present.

Due to other more primitive features visible on ''A. africanus'', some researchers believe the hominin, instead of being a direct ancestor of more modern hominins, evolved into ''Paranthropus''. The one particular robust australopithecine seen as a descendent of ''A. africanus'' is ''Paranthropus robustus''. Both ''P. robustus'' and ''A. africanus'' craniums seem very alike despite the more heavily built features of ''P. robustus'' that are adaptations for heavy chewing like a gorilla. ''A. africanus'', on the other hand, had a cranium which quite closely resembled that of a chimp, yet both their brains measure about 400&nbsp;cc to 500&nbsp;cc and probably had an ape-like intelligence.<ref name="info2"/> ''A. africanus'' had a pelvis that was built for slightly better bipedalism than that of ''A. afarensis''. 

Charles Darwin suggested that humans had originally evolved from Africa, but during the early 20th century most anthropologists and scientists supported the idea that Asia was the best candidate for human origins.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071025160653.htm New Ideas About Human Migration From Asia To Americas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, the famous Leakey family have argued in favor of the African descent since most hominid discoveries such as the Laetoli footprints were uncovered in Eastern Africa.<ref>[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/127 Apologetics Press - Human Evolution and the “Record of the Rocks”<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
