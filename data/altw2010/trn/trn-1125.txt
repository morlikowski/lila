The university's current enrolment is over 36,000, placing it among the five largest universities in the country.  The main campus covers 50 city blocks with over 90 buildings directly across the North Saskatchewan River from downtown Edmonton.

The continued economic boom in Alberta, driven mainly by high energy prices, has resulted in multi-billion dollar government fiscal surpluses.<ref>{{cite web

==History and Overview==

===Early history===
thumb|200px|right|Tory building at the University of Alberta
thumb|200px|Tory Theatre at the [[University of Alberta]]
thumb|right|Rutherford House, located on the north-east corner of the University of Alberta campus.

The University of Alberta, a single, public provincial university, was chartered in 1906 in Edmonton, Alberta with a new University Act. University of Alberta was modelled on the American state university, with an emphasis on extension work and applied research. <ref name="autogenerated1">http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008242</ref>

University of Alberta is a non-denominational university which offers undergraduate and graduate programs. <ref name="autogenerated2">http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0003521</ref> With the hiring of 1908 using temporary facilities, while the first building on campus was under construction. <ref name="autogenerated2" />

In a letter from McGill University College in Legislative Assembly, with Premier Alexander C. Rutherford as its sponsor.

The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the 2 bodies and to perform institutional leadership. <ref name="autogenerated1" />

It awarded its first degrees in 1912. <ref name="autogenerated2" /> In 1912 the university established its Department of Extension. In the early part of 20th century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced. <ref name="autogenerated1" />

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. The single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities - the University of Calgary was established in 1966. <ref name="autogenerated1" /> The University of Alberta first offered programs of study at Calgary in 1945 and continued until 1966 when the University of Calgary was established as an autonomous institution. <ref name="autogenerated2" />

===Location===
The location of the university was to be decided along the same lines as that of 1905.) Saskatchewan had to please two competing cities when deciding the location of its capital city and provincial university. Thus, Regina was designated the provincial capital and Strathcona was granted the university, much to the chagrin of Calgary, for many years to come. 

Meanwhile, in 1912 the two cities of Edmonton and Strathcona were amalgamated under the name of the former; Edmonton had thus became both the political and academic capital, at the expense of Calgary. This was just one act in a larger rivalry between the two cities, often called the Battle of Alberta.

===Faculties===

In 1913, a medical school established at the University of Alberta in Edmonton was opened.  <ref> http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com History of Medical Education in Canada  </ref>
By 1920, the university had six faculties (Arts and Sciences, Applied Science, Agriculture, Medicine, Dentistry, and Law) and two schools (Pharmacy and Accountancy). It awarded a range of degrees: Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MSc), and Doctor of Laws (LLD). There were 851 male students and 251 female students, and 171 academic staff, including 14 women.<ref>Dominion Bureau of Statistics, ''Canada Year Book 1921'', Ottawa, 1922</ref>

===Newspapers===
The university has two main newspapers, ''Folio'' [http://www.ualberta.ca/folio/] and ''The Gateway'' [http://www.thegatewayonline.ca]. ''Folio'' is the official newspaper published by the "Office of Public Affairs" every two weeks from September to June. ''The Gateway'' is the official student newspaper. Fully autonomous, it publishes "most Tuesdays and Thursdays".

===Book publishing===

The University of Alberta Press, which was founded in 1969, concentrates on western Canadian history, general science and ecology. <ref>http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008267</ref> The University of Alberta Press publishes an average of between 20 and 30 books per year, often accepting submissions from across Canada for over 50% of the publications. Their current active title listing has more than 150 books,<ref name=uap>[http://www.uap.ualberta.ca University of Alberta Press]</ref> as of 2007.
