'''Waldshut-Tiengen''' is a city in southwestern Swiss border. It is the district seat and at the same time the biggest city in Waldshut district and a "middle centre" in the area of the "high centre" Swiss cantons of Schaffhausen and Zürich. This classification relates to Walter Christaller's Central Place Theory, however, and not to any official administrative scheme.

The city, which was newly created in the framework of the 1975 municipal reform, at that time passed the 20,000 mark in population. City council then applied to have the city raised to ''Große Kreisstadt'', which the government of Baden-Württemberg granted with on 1 July 1976. Waldshut-Tiengen is also in an "administrative community" (''Verwaltungsgemeinschaft'') with the communities of Dogern, Lauchringen und Weilheim.

== Geography ==
Waldshut-Tiengen lies at the edge of the southern Wutach meets the Rhein, on the way into the ''Klettgau'', a German-Swiss border region on the Rhine's north bank. Also within the town's municipal area are the rivers Steina and Schlücht, which both empty into the Wutach. From this arose Tiengen's former description as a ''Viertälerstadt'' (four-valley town).

=== Neighbouring towns ===
The following towns all border on the town of Waldshut-Tiengen. The list runs clockwise, starting in the west: Dogern, Albbruck, Dachsberg, Weilheim, Ühlingen-Birkendorf, Koblenz, Leuggern and Full-Reuenthal (all in the canton of Aargau).

=== Parts of town ===
The town's municipal area consists of the two townsites of Waldshut and Tiengen and the nine communities amalgamated with these two former towns in the municipal reform. These are Aichen (with Gutenburg), Breitenfeld, Detzeln, Eschbach, Gurtweil, Indlekofen, Krenkingen, Oberalpfen and Waldkirch (with Gaiß and Schmitzingen).

For all nine once independent communities as well as for the community of Schmitzingen, which was formerly part of Waldkirch, ''Ortschaften'' have been established in the sense in which this term refers to municipal organization in Baden-Württemberg. This means that they each have a community council chosen by the eligible voters at each municipal election, and each one with a chairman or chairwoman. The Ortschaften bear the same names as these former communities, with a few anomalies (Aichen-Gutenberg for the former Aichen, Gaiß-Waldkirch for the two neighbourhoods in the former Waldkirch, and Schmitzingen, which was formerly part of Waldkirch). The size of these councils is limited to six, but Gurtweil is an exception with ten.

== History ==
thumb|The Old Town of Waldshut
thumb|The Castle of Tiengen
Until 1803, Waldshut belonged to Further Austria. Tiengen/Hochrhein (until 2 September 1964 Tiengen (Oberrhein)) was the residence of the Landgraves of Klettgau who belonged in early modern times first to the Counts of Sulz, and after their line died out, to the ''Fürsten'' of Schwarzenberg. Gurtweil belonged first to the Abbey of St. Gall, and later to the Rheinau Monastery, but after the Thirty Years' War to Saint Blaise's Benedictine Monastery in the Black Forest.

In the Waldshut War of 1468 – a localized conflict over hegemony in the south Black Forest region – Tiengen was absorbed by the Old Swiss Confederacy, while the town of Waldshut was besieged and partly destroyed.

In 1805, Waldshut went to Amt'', which over the years was changed many times, and in 1939 was turned into the ''Kreis'' (District) of Waldshut. In 1973, the district's area was increased under the municipal reform.

Tiengen likewise went to Baden in 1806 and belonged to the ''Amt'' of Klettgau, and in 1812 to the regional ''Amt'' of Tiengen, which was abolished in 1819. Thereafter the town belonged to the regional ''Amt'' of Waldshut.

=== Amalgamation ===
Waldshut-Tiengen's municipal area developed as follows:
* On 1 January 1971 the communities of Breitenfeld and Detzeln were amalgamated into the town of Tiengen/Hochrhein. They were followed on 1 July 1974 by the communities of Aichen and Krenkingen.
* On 1 July 1971, the communities of Eschbach, Indlekofen, Oberalpfen and Waldkirch (with the communities of Gaiß and Schmitzingen, amalgamated in 1935) were amalgamated into the town of Waldshut.
* On 1 January 1975, both towns, Waldshut and Tiengen/Hochrhein, along with the community of Gurtweil, were amalgamated to form the new town of Waldshut-Tiengen.

=== Population development ===
Population figures are for respective municipal areas at the times to which the figures apply. Until 1974, the figures for the town of Waldshut are given. The figures are either census results (¹) or official extrapolations.

=== Religion ===
Waldshut first belonged to the Archbishopric of Freiburg, and indeed to the two deaconries of Waldshut and Wutachtal. These have been merged into three pastoral units (divisions consisting of several parishes). The pastoral unit of Maria Bronnen includes the parishes of St. Marien Waldkirch, St. Sebastian Aichen and St. Simon und Judas Gurtweil as well as the neighbouring parishes of St. Peter und Paul Weilheim, St. Stephan Weilheim-Nöggenschwiel, St. Pankratius Berau and St. Laurentius Brenden (both in the community of Ühlingen-Birkendorf). The pastoral unit of Waldshut includes the Liebfrauengemeinde and the neighbouring parish of St. Klemens in Dogern. In the Deaconry of Wutachtal, the two parishes of Mariä Himmelfahrt Tiengen and St. Nikolaus Krenkingen together with the neighbouring parish of Herz Jesu Lauchringen-Unterlauchringen belong to the pastoral unit of Tiengen.

In the 19th century, Protestants also came to Waldshut and Tiengen. Waldshut's Protestants were at first under Säckingen's care, but in 1870, Waldshut got its own minister, and in 1890, an affiliated parish was established. In 1921, the community became a fully-fledged parish in its own right. To this parish also nowadays belong the Protestants in the communities of Eschbach, Indlekofen and Waldkirch, along with a few other neighbouring communities. A Protestant community also developed in Tiengen in 1871, which at first was affiliated with Kadelburg. The ''Christuskirche'' (church) was built in 1905. There has been a fully-fledged parish there since 1926. To this Evangelical parish also nowadays belong the Protestants in the communities of Aichen, Breitenfeld, Detzeln, Gurtweil and Krenkingen along with a few other neighbouring communities. The Protestants in the community of Oberalpfen belong to the Hochrhein church region of the Evangelical State Church in Baden.

Alongside the two big churches, there are also communities belonging to free churches, among which are an Evangelical Free Church community (Baptists) with their Balthasar Hubmaier Church, the New Apostolic Church, and the Old Catholic Church.

== Politics ==
Waldshut-Tiengen's municipal council consists of 26 unpaid city councillors whose chairman or chairwoman is the mayor (''Oberbürgermeister''). The last municipal election on 13 June 2004 yielded the following division of seats:

=== Mayors ===
Previously, a ''Schultheiß'' (village head) stood at the lead of the town of Waldshut, including an eight person council. Both were  directly elected. In 1527, the ''Schultheiß'' was temporarily appointed by the lords (''Landesherren''). Besides this, there were also ''Ratsherren'' ("Council Lords") ("Inner Council") consisting of four "old" and four "new" advisers. The first was the governor of the ''Schultheiß's'' office, and thereby the town's actual mayor. For the towsfolk's representation, there was an "Outer Council" with guild masters. In the 16th century, the Inner Council had a different organization. To this belonged the ''Schultheiß'', the governor of the ''Schultheiß's'' office, the town clerk and five advisers. The Outer Council then had six members. By 1789, there was a ''Bürgermeister'' instead of a governor of the ''Schultheiß's'' office.

In Tiengen there was first a ''Schultheiß'' and six advisers, then as of 1422 an elected ''Schultheiß'' and the advisers as well as a reeve (''Vogt'') appointed by the lord. The bylaws were then changed many times. In 1703, the town head bore the title ''Stadtvogt'' ("town reeve")

Since the town of Waldshut-Tiengen was raised to ''Große Kreisstadt'' in 1976, the town head has borne the official title ''Oberbürgermeister''. He or she is directly elected by eligible voters for a term of eight years and is head of the municipal council. His second-in-command is the first councillor, who bears the title ''Bürgermeister''.

=== Coat of arms ===
The coat of arms was granted by the Freiburg Government Presidium on German: ''Waldhüter''), and is therefore also deemed to be a "canting" coat of arms, being somewhat suggestive of the former town's name. The Madonna and Child on the right side come from Tiengen's old town seal, and are also known to date back quite a long way. They are, however, emblazoned a bit differently compared to the originals.

=== City partnerships ===
*  Blois on the Loire, France, since 30 June 1963
*  Lewes, East Sussex, England, United Kingdom, since 1973

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Other than small-scale machine and furniture manufacturing industries, the town of Waldshut-Tiengen no longer has an industrial establishment worth mentioning. A large part of the working population of the town go to work each day in Switzerland, which is just across the river.

In northern Tiengen there has been since 1930 a large transformer station for 380, 220 and 110&nbsp;kV run by RWE AG. This is where the western branch of the North-South Transmission Line – the world's oldest – coming from Herbertingen ends.

=== Transport ===
The town lies on the Hochrheinbahn, a railway running between Basel and Schaffhausen (both in Switzerland), and its station serves as an important railway hub.

The railway line across the border to Koblenz, opened in 1859, is the oldest line across the Rhine between Germany and Switzerland. The Wutachtalbahn, another railway, has its southern terminus in Waldshut-Tiengen. Local public transport is provided by several buslines. The town belongs to the Waldshut Tariff Association.
