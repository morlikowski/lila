Mranggulangi kahanan mau, Resi Gotama banjur mbuwang cupu mau lan tumiba ing tlaga Sumala. Guwarsa lan Guwarsi nekad nyemplung tlaga, déné Anjani mung wani raup rai. Resi Gotama sepata yèn kelakuwan bocah telu mau kaya réwanda. Kocap mangkono, Guwarsa dalah Guwarsi dadi kebak wulu lan nduwé buntut kaya déné kethèk. Déné Anjani mung rainé sing arupa kethèk. Wiwit kuwi, Guwarsa banjur ganti jeneng Subali lan Guwarsi ngalih jeneng  dadi Sugriwa.

In Hindu mythology, '''Sugriva''' (Vali, whom he succeeded as ruler of the vanara or monkey kingdom Kishkindha.  He was the son of Surya, the Hindu deity of the sun.  As king of the monkeys, Sugriva aided Rama in his quest to liberate his wife Sita from captivity at the hands of the Rakshasa king Ravana.

==The Story of Sugriva in the Great Epics==
The story of Sugriva is part of the Ramayana and, in an abbreviated version, can also be found in the Mahabharata. 

===Sugriva and Vali have a disagreement===
Tara was his wife, and Sugriva his brother.  One day, a raging demon came to the gates of the capital and challenged Vali to a fight.  Vali accepted the challenge, but when he sallied forth, the demon fled in terror into a deep cave.  Vali entered the cave in pursuit of the demon, telling Sugriva to wait outside.  When Vali did not return, and upon hearing demonic shouts in the cave and seeing blood oozing from its mouth, Sugriva concluded that his brother had been killed.  With a heavy heart, Sugriva rolled a boulder to seal the cave's opening, returned to Kishkindha, and assumed kingship over the vanaras.  Vali, however, ultimately prevailed in his combat with the demon and returned home.  Seeing Sugriva acting as king, he concluded that his brother had betrayed him.  Though Sugriva humbly attempted to explain himself, Vali would not listen.  As a result, Sugriva was ostracized from the kingdom, and the brothers became bitter enemies.<ref>Ramayana of Valmiki, Book IV, Canto 9-10.</ref>

===Sugriva makes an alliance with Rama===

In exile, Sugriva made the acquaintance of Rama, the avatar of Vishnu, who was on a quest to rescue his wife Sita from the demon Ravana, king of the Rakshasas.  Rama promised Sugriva that he would kill Vali and would reinstate Sugriva as the king of the monkeys.  Sugriva, in turn, promised to help Rama with his quest.<ref>Ramayana of Valmiki, Book IV, Canto 8, 10; Mahabharata, Book III: Varna Parva, Section 278.</ref>

===Rama kills Vali; Sugriva takes over the monkey kingdom===
Together, Sugriva and Rama went to seek out Vali.  While Rama stood back, Sugriva accused Vali of usurping his wife and kingdom, and challenged him to a fight.  The brothers rushed at each other, fighting with trees and stones, with fists, nails and teeth.  They were evenly matched and indistinguishable to the observer, until Sugriva's counsellor Tara and the monkey kingdom.<ref>Ramayana of Valmiki, Book IV, Canto 11 ff.; Mahabharata, Book III: Varna Parva, Section 278.</ref>

===Sugriva helps Rama to conquer Lanka and to rescue Sita===
Sugriva sent his trusted advisor Hanuman to determine Sita's whereabouts.  Hanuman's finding was that Ravana was holding Sita captive in his island fortress of Lanka.  When Rama decided to move against Lanka, Sugriva placed his army of monkeys at the hero's disposal.  The army crossed into Lanka by means of a specially erected bridge and laid siege to Rama's citadel.  After some hard fighting, the monkeys prevailed over the demons, Rama slew Ravana, and Sita was liberated.<ref>Mahabharata, Book III: Varna Parva, Section 280 ff.</ref>

During the battle, Sugriva almost came to a violent death when he decided to take on the Rakshasa Kumbhakarna, a brother of Ravana.  Seeing the demon in the middle of the fray, Sugriva attacked him with the trunk of a sala tree.  The tree, however, merely broke over the demon's head.  Kumhhakarna then seized Sugriva and dragged him off, and no doubt would have killed him but for the timely intervention of Rama's brother Lakshmana.<ref>Mahabharata, Book III: Varna Parva, Section 285.</ref>
