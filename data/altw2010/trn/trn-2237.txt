'''Necrophagia''' was one of the first death metal bands, assembled in 1983. Their name derives from the act of cannibalizing a corpse. The word derives from the two Greek words ''nekron'' (corpse) and ''phagein'' (to eat).

==History==
===Early days===
Necrophagia was a popular group in the underground "tape trading" scene of the early-to-mid-1980s. Featuring hard-driving metal and growling vocals, Necrophagia became a pioneer in the fledgling extreme metal genre. Their first full-length album, ''Season of the Dead'', was recorded and released in 1987.

===With Phil Anselmo===
The band then split up due to musical differences, and lay dormant until 1997 when frontman Killjoy reformed the band with then Pantera frontman Phil Anselmo (under the pseudonym Anton Crowley) on guitars, Wayne Fabra on drums and Dustin Havnen on bass. This lineup released the album ''Holocausto de la Morte'' and the EP ''Black Blood Vomitorium''. Havnen was then replaced by Jared Faulk, with Gorelord mainman Frediablo also joining as a second guitarist and Opal Enthroned (then Anselmo's wife) joining the band on keyboards. This line up released the ''Cannibal Holocaust'' EP in 2001 before splitting up leaving Killjoy & Frediablo as the only members for a short time.

===2002 to 2006===
In 2002 Killjoy announced the new Necrophagia line-up. Joining him and Frediablo would be Fug on guitar, Iscariah (formerly of Immortal) on bass, Titta Tanni on drums and Mirai Kawashima of avant-garde Sigh on keyboards. This proved to be the most productive time for Necrophagia, with all members concentrating on the band rather than treating it as a side project. They released the albums ''The Divine Art of Torture'' and ''Harvest Ritual Vol. 1'', as well as the ''Goblins Be Thine'' EP.

On June 6, 2006 Necrophagia released ''Slit Wrists And Casket Rot'', a live album from their "Harvesting the Dead" tour. 

Frediablo left the band in early 2006 to concentrate on his other band Gorelord, and has been replaced by Undead Torment.

===Latest News===
On 22nd December 2007 Necrophagia announced that ''Death Trip 69'' their long-awaited new album will be released before Summer 2008, followed by a major tour. ''Death Trip 69'' will feature several guest appearances, including lead guitar parts by Slipknot. Opal Enthroned rejoined the band on 5th March 2008<ref> [http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=34665 MetalUnderground.com] </ref>
