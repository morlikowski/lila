از آن‌جا که دامنه تمدن اسلامی جز عربستان کشورهای بسیاری از جمله مصر، ایران، هند و آفریقا را دربرمی‌گرفت؛ '''موسیقی اسلامی''' نیز با تنوع و گوناگونی روبه‌رو بوده است.

== تاریخچه ==
در میان فقهای اسلام کسانی مانند شهاب‌الدین الهیثمی و ابن ابی‌الدنیا بوده‌اند که موسیقی را یکسره لهو و لعب می‌دانستند و آن را مکروه یا حرام تلقی می‌نمودند. فارابی انکار می‌کرد که موسیقی بتواند هرگونه حالت روحی یا هر نوع شور و هیجانی را در شخص برانگیزد. ابن‌زیله نیز معتقد بود که موسیقی می‌تواند شخص را به ارتکاب عمل گناه بکشاند. با این حال، ابوحامد محمد غزالی، موسیقی و سماع را جایز دانسته است.

=== موسیقی در بغداد ===
در بغداد، خلفای عباسی چون هارون‌الرشید و مأمون از موسیقی حمایت می‌نمودند، در زمان متوکل و منتصر هم‌چنان موسیقی در دربار خلافت رونق داشت. در این دوره بسیاری از موسیقی‌دانان برجسته چون ابن‌طاهر خزائی، قریص جراحی، جحظه برمکی جذب دستگاه خلافت شدند.

=== موسیقی ایرانی ===
ایران و عربستان در موسیقی بسیاری از سازها و امور را از یک‌دیگر وام گرفته‌اند. بسیاری از موسیقیدان‌های بغداد، ایرانی‌تبار بودند، از جمله سرخسی، زکریای رازی، رودکی و راتبه نیشابوری.

=== موسیقی اسپانیای مسلمان ===
در اسپانیای مسلمان، در دوران فرمان‌روایی امویان اندلس از موسیقی حمایت بسیاری به عمل آمد. مدارس بسیاری برای پرورش دختران آوازه‌خوان بنیاد نهاده شد؛ بسیاری از این دختران وارد دربار حکمرانان اموی اندلس می‌شدند؛ بزرگ‌ترین خنیاگر اندلس عباس بن نسائی بود. نظام موسیقایی در اندلس همان نظام عربی رایج در شرق بود که بر گام‌های فیثاغورث مبتنی بود.

'''Islamic music''' is Muslim religious music, as sung or played in public services or private devotions. The classic heartland of Islam is Arabia and the Middle East, North Africa and Egypt, Iran, Central Asia, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Because Islam is a multicultural religion, the musical expression of its adherents is diverse. The indigenous musical styles of these areas have shaped the devotional music enjoyed by contemporary Muslims:
===Secular and folk musical styles===
====Middle East====
* Arabic classical music

The Seljuk Turks, a nomadic tribe that converted to Islam, conquered Anatolia (now Turkey), and held the Caliphate as the Ottoman Empire, also had a strong influence on Islamic music. See:  

* Turkish classical music

All these regions were connected by trade long before the Islamic conquests of the 600s and later, and it is likely that musical styles traveled the same routes as trade goods. However, lacking recordings, we can only speculate as to the pre-Islamic music of these areas. Islam must have had a great influence on music, as it united vast areas under the first caliphs, and facilitated trade between distant lands. Certainly the mystics, spread their music far and wide.

====South Asia====

The music of the Muslim populations of South Asia (classical musical modes, and is generally distinct in style and orchestration, yet due to the strong links encountered between the Middle-East, Central Asia and South Asia, they are closer to Middle-Eastern styles than those of the peripheric outreaches of the Islamic world, which tend to be purely indigenous.

====The Peripheral Islamic world: Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia/Oceania====

Sub-Saharan Fula, Hausa groups had experienced international recognition in the contemporary world. 

Many music genres of these areas generally predate the coming of Islam or have very little influence from the Islamic heartland, the exceptions being Malay Zapin genres, of which both had taken a lot of influence from the Middle East after Islamization. 

See '''West African music''', '''Gamelan''' and '''Kulintang''' for further information on the separate musical genres, traditions and ensembles predominant among Muslims in these areas.

== Types of Muslim devotional recitation and music ==
===Nasheed===
Some groups of contemporary Muslim musicians perform devotional songs they call ''nasheed''. Most nasheed groups perform using only voice and percussion instruments. This music is considered halal, permissible, by many strict Muslims. Some nasheed groups add other instruments.

=== Sufi music === 

Sufi worship services are often called dhikr or zikr. See that article for further elaboration. 

The dhikr of South Asian Muslims is "quietist". The Sufi services best known in the West are the chanting and rhythmic dancing of the whirling dervishes or Mevlevi Sufis of Turkey. Some Mevlevi music can be heard on the Sufi Music CD recommended below. 

However, Sufis may also perform devotional songs in public, for the enjoyment and edification of listeners. The mood is religious, but the gathering is not a worship service. 

In Turkey, once the seat of the Ottoman Empire and the Caliphate, concerts of sacred song are called "''Mehfil-e-Sama<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' " (or "gathering of ''Sama<nowiki>'</nowiki>''"). Song forms include ilahi and nefe. 

Qasidah is a form of poetry. In this form of poetry the praise is presented.  Qasidah is four types, 1. Hamd (Hymn) 2. Naat (A poem in praise of Prophet Muhammad 3. Manqabat (A poem in praise of Saints) 4. Madah (A poem in praise of honourables)

In India and Pakistan, these concerts, and the associated style of music, are called  qawwali. A traditional qawwali programme would include: 

* A hamd -- a song in praise of Allah
* A naat -- a song in praise of the Prophet Muhammad
* Manqabats -- songs in praise of the illustrious teachers of the Sufi brotherhood to which the musicians belong
* Ghazals  -- songs of intoxication and yearning, which use the language of romantic love to express the soul's longing for union with the divine. 

Shi'a concerts follow the naat with a song in praise of Ali (also manqabat)
and a marsiya, a lamentation over the death of much of Ali's family at the Battle of Karbala.

See Poetry in Islam for a discussion of the lyrics.

Qawwali is increasingly popular as a musical genre and performances may attract those who want to hear virtuoso singing rather than contemplate the divine. Some artists may skip the long sequence of praise songs and go straight from the introductory ''hamd'' to the popular romantic songs, or even dispense with the devotional content completely. This is cause for much consternation for traditional enthusiasts/devotees of the form. The most well known qawwali singer is Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. The dimension and style of music he brought about no one else is able to produce till this day. 

As Sufi music has developed so have the generations. A Pakistani rock band, Junoon, was formed in the 1990s to bring a modern twist to suit the new younger generations. The band was a huge world wide hit that created a lot of popularity for not only Pakistan.

===Music for public religious celebrations=== 

* Mawlid music -- performed for the birthday of Muhammad, in various regional styles. 
* Ta'zieh music --  Ta'zieh is a passion play, part musical drama, part religious drama, rarely performed outside Iran. It depicts the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, venerated by Shia Muslims.
* Ashurah music -- performed during the Moharram mourning period, commemorating the deaths of Imam Hussein and his followers.
* Sikiri (from the Arabic word "Dhikr" which means remembrance of God -- performed by the Qadiriyya Sufi orders of Yao people in East and Southern Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and South Africa).
* Manzuma -- moral songs performed in Ethiopia.
* Madih nabawi -- Arabic hymns praising the prophet Muhammad.
