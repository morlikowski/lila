'''Plevel''' je rostlina, která roste v kulturním porostu proti vůli pěstitele. Tedy může stejná rostlina být žádoucí a pěstována(kopřiva dvoudomá jako léčivka a potrava drůbeže) stejně jako v jiném porostu označena za plevel a hubena. Mnoho z nich patří mezi léčivé rostliny. Plevele mohou ochuzovat polní plodiny o vodu, půdu o půdní vzduch a o živiny. Snižují teplotu půdy, zastiňují polní plodiny, podporují šíření chorob a škůdců. Ztráty v biomase příslušné polní plodiny způsobené plevelem mohou dosáhnout až 20–60&nbsp;%. V ČR je v současné době uváděno 198 možných druhů plevelů, z nich je však 35 druhů považováno za druhy ohrožené.

== Dělení plevele ==
*'''Plevel jednoletý přezimující'''
*'''Vytrvalé druhy plevele''' – rozmnožují se převážně enerativně a vegetativně.
*'''Paratizické druhy plevele''' – například kokotice jetelová, záraza menší.
*'''Poloparazitické''' – například černýš rolní, kokrhel luštinec.

== Vybrané plevele ==
* ambrózie pelyňkolistá
* bršlice kozí noha
* bytel metlatý
* hulevník povolžský
* kopřiva dvoudomá
* laskavec bílý
* laskavec zelenoklasý
* laskavec žmindovitý
* peťour malokvětý
* pýr plazivý
* rozrazil nitkovitý

A '''weed''' in a general sense is a native or nonnative plants that grow and reproduce aggressively.<ref>ISBN 0-7167-1031-5 Janick, Jules. ''Horticultural Science.'' San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1979. Page 308.</ref> 

Weeds may be unwanted because they are unsightly, or they limit the growth of other plants by blocking light or using up horticultural plants.  Weeds may be a nuisance because they have thorns or prickles, cause skin irritation when contacted, or parts of the plants might come off and attach to fur or clothes. 

==Definition==
The term ''weed'' in its general sense is a subjective one, without any classification value, since a "weed" is not a weed when growing where it belongs or is wanted. Indeed, a number of "weeds" have been used in gardens or other cultivated-plant settings. An example is the corncockle, ''Agrostemma'', which was a common field weed exported from Europe along with wheat, but now  sometimes grown as a garden plant.<ref>[http://davesgarden.com/pf/go/1341/ PlantFiles: Detailed information on Corn Cockle Agrostemma githago<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Weedy plants generally share similar deltas, and areas that are often burned. Since human agricultural practices often mimic these natural environments where weedy species have evolved, weeds have adapted to grow and proliferate in human-disturbed areas such as agricultural fields, lawns, roadsides, and construction sites.

The weedy nature of these species often gives them an advantage over more desirable crop species because they often grow quickly and reproduce quickly, have seeds that persist in the soil seed bank for many years, or have short lifespans with multiple generations in the same growing season. Perennial weeds often have underground stems that spread out under the soil surface or, like ground ivy (''Glechoma hederacea''), have creeping stems that root and spread out over the ground.<ref>[http://employees.csbsju.edu/ssaupe/biol327/Lecture/foraging_case_study.htm Plant Physiology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  A number of weedy species have developed allelopathy, chemical means to prevent the germination or growth of neighboring plants. 

== Relation to humans ==
As long as humans have cultivated plants, weeds have been a problem.  Weeds have even been mentioned in religious and literature texts like the following quotes from Shakespearean sonnet:

<blockquote>"Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.  It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground,"<ref>Genesis 3:17-19 New International Version</ref></blockquote> 

<blockquote>"To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds: But why thy odour matcheth not thy show, The soil is this, that thou dost common grow."<ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/t/lit/shakespeare-sonnets/69.html William Shakespeare: Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view — Infoplease.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>     

Weed seeds are often collected and transported with crops after the harvesting of thumb|right|700 cattle that were killed overnight by a poisonous weed.<ref>Coupe, Sheen, general editor, Frontier Country Vol. 1, p. 298, Weldon Russell, Willougby</ref> They are often foreign species mistakenly or accidentally imported into a region where there are few natural controls to limit their spread and population. Many weeds have ideal areas for growth and reproduction thanks to large areas of open soil created by the conversion of land to agriculture, and human distribution of food crops mixed with seeds of weeds from other parts of the world. Thus humans are the vector of transport and the producer of disturbed environments, so weedy species have an ideal association with humans.

A number of weeds, such as the dandelion ''Taraxacum'', are edible, and their leaves and roots may be used for food or herbal medicine. Burdock is common weed over much of the world, and is sometimes used to make soup and other medicine in East Asia. These so-called "beneficial weeds" may have other beneficial effects, such as drawing away the attacks of crop-destroying insects, but often are breeding grounds for insects and pathogens that attack other plants.  Dandelions are one of several species which break up hardpan in overly cultivated fields, helping crops grow deeper root systems. Some modern species of domesticated flower actually originated as weeds in cultivated fields and have been bred by people into garden plants for their flowers or foliage.
