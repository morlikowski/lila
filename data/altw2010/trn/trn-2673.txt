==Coastal storms==
There have been many hurricanes and huge storms that have hit the small island of Sea Isle City, New Jersey.  The storms of the 1890s, 1920s, and the 1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane have been some of the worst natural disasters to hit the coast of New Jersey.  The Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962, a major Nor'easter that hit on March 6, 1962, tops all other storms that have hit the area in the recent past.  The storm lasted three days of continuous rain.  It was categorized as a "100-year storm."  Almost every beach front home or property was destroyed or damaged.  Many people evacuated in time to save their lives, but came back to find their homes and assets destroyed.  Eventually, the only way out of town was the causeway, and when that flooded, rescuers had to use helicopters to evacuate the rest of the town.
