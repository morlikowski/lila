In February 1999, the Italian Under-21 International was rewarded by the coach of Italy, cap in a friendly against Norway. He became the first player of Bari to play for the national side in 50 years. Throughout the 1998-99 season, he made 32 appearances and scored four goals.

In 2005-06, following the injury of Zebina, arrival of Chiellini and his successful switch with the national team, Zambrotta was again switched to the right-back.

In his second game for the U21 against Wales on April 22 1998, he scored the 2nd goal of Italy on the 43rd minute and helped Italy to win the game 2-1. In 1998, he played in all six games of the Italy U21 while they won 5 of them and drew the last one against Spain.

It was on tour with the under 21's that Luca earned the nickname 'the Mermaid' for his allegedly spending one hour every night in front of the mirror grooming at his now trademark goatee.

=== First cap ===
After some impressive displays for the U21 and the amazing start of the season 1998-99, Zambrotta earned his first cap on Norway, Zambrotta played well throughout the game.

=== 2000 Sydney Olympic Games ===
After the disappointing Euro 2000, Zambrotta was back with the U21 side for the Olympic Games in September. He started in the games against Australia and Honduras while they won 1-0 and 3-1 respectively. Since Italy was qualified for the quarter finals already, the coach put Zambrotta on the bench for the last game Nigeria and substituted him on at the 80th minute. This would be the last time he played for the U21 national team, with a total of 13 U21-caps. Italy was defeated by Spain, the later silver medalists, with one goal in the quarter final and Zambrotta did not play in this game. suffered a serious thigh injury after a tackle by a Korean defender. He was brought off the field and Italy lost the game in the extra time after a 1-1 draw.

=== 2004 UEFA Euro ===

On 30 May 2004, Zambrotta scored his first ever international goal in the game against Tunisia. A Bernardo Corradi header was flapped out for Zambrotta's fierce volley into the roof of the net in the 89th minute while Italy won the game by 4-0. In Euro 2004, although the performance of Italy was largely disappointing and the team was eliminated at the group stage, Zambrotta was one of the few Italian players to be praised for his performances.

=== 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany ===
After two consecutive disappointing major tournaments, Trapattoni resigned as the coach of the Azzurri. The new coach for Italy was Marcello Lippi, who had just resigned as the Juventus coach to take over the Azzurri. At the end of 2005, as Lippi brought on many new faces for the squad, he once again switched Zambrotta's position - to the right-back this time.

In the Lippi era, Zambrotta remains one of the core players in the team. He featured in eight of the ten FIFA World Cup European qualification matches to help Italy qualify as the group winner. On 15 May 2006, Zambrotta was chosen as one of the 23 players to participate in the 2006 FIFA World Cup and he played well.

==== Injury fear ====
During the Azzurri's final preparations for the World Cup, Zambrotta injured his left thigh during a training match at the national team's training base at Coverciano on 28 May 2006. He picked up the injury in a training match against an amateur team San Giminiano. This brought certain fears for the Italian squad and Lippi decided to keep Daniele Bonera on stand-by in case Zambrotta could not recover in time.

Scans on Zambrotta's thigh in the final days before Italy's first group match revealed that he would only miss the opening match.

==== Group stage ====
Italy began its World Cup journey against Ghana on USA on 17 June 2006 playing at the left-back position. This was his fifth appearance in the FIFA World Cup, in which his teammates Cristian Zaccardo scored an own goal and Daniele De Rossi got sent off for an elbowing offence. Italy's performance was disappointing as they just managed to draw 1-1 with the USA in spite of playing the entire second half with a one-man-advantage. Zambrotta played the whole match without ever excelling.
