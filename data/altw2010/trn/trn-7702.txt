thumb|Skeppskatt
'''Skeppskatt''', folklig benämning på polydaktyli hos katter, dvs fler tår än de normala 18 (5 på varje framtass, 4 på baktassarna). 
Denna missbildning betraktas på vissa håll felaktigt som en egen ras. 

Det dokumenterade fall med flest tår är enligt Guinness Rekordbok katten Tiger med 27 stycken. Ägare är Gareth Ukrainetz från Leduc i Alberta, Kanada.
 
Polydaktyli vållar normalt inte katten några besvär. Dock kan problem med inväxta klor uppstå om inte katten får regelbunden klovård. Det varnas dock från vissa håll för konstant avel på katter med denna missbildning. Sådan, målmedveten inavel (främst i USA) har medfört andra, plågsamma mutationer. Målmedveten inavel är i sig en mutationsrisk, och det finns inga säkra belägg för att just polydaktylin har givit upphov till mutationerna ifråga.

Utställning av, och avel på, katter med polydaktyli är förbjuden av de flesta kattorganisationer, t ex SVERAK (och dess moderorganisation FIFe). FIFes motivering är dock inte eventuella hälsorisker orsakade av polydaktylin, utan att man inte vill uppmuntra till inavel av raskatter av rena popularitetsskäl.

A '''polydactyl cat''' is a congenital physical anomaly, with more than usual number of toes on one or all of its  cat body type genetic mutation. In anatomical abnormality of having more than the usual number of digits on the feet.

==Description==
Normal cats have five toes on each front paw and four toes on each hind paw. Polydactyl cats may have as many as seven digits on front and/or hind paws, and various combinations of anywhere from four to seven are common, although each of the front and rear paws are typically the same.  Polydactyly is most commonly found on the front paws only, with polydactyly of all four paws being less common.  It is rare for a cat to have polydactyl hind paws only. 

The true polydactyly - commonly called '''mitten cat''' or '''thumb cat''' condition - is a genetically inherited as an autosomal dominant trait of the '''Pd gene''' with incomplete penetrance. This type of polydactyly is not life-threatening and usually not even debilitating to a cat. Some polydactyl manual dexterity generally not observed in non-polydactyl cats, such as opening latches or catching objects with a single paw.

Feline radial hypoplasia (see squitten) is a mimic of polydactyly and is considered a severe condition. Radial hypoplasia may cause the formation of extra jointed toes, but it is not a result of the Pd gene normally associated with polydactyls. It thus does not cause the "mitten cat" or "thumb cat" condition where the extra toes occur separated from the normal ones just like a dewclaw, usually associated with an additional  pad which makes them look like a underdeveloped foot sticking out near the base of the normal toes. 

Rather, radial hypoplasia-related extra toes are immediately adjacent to the normal ones, giving the cat overly large, flat feet - colloquially known as "patty feet" or "hamburger feet". Though this looks less serious than true polydactyly (as the feet appear "normal" apart from having one or two extra toes), breeding such cats will eventually result in severely crippled offspring that will have to be euthanized. Cats used in polydactyl breeding programs can be screened by x-ray for indicators of radial hypoplasia, and cats suspected to have radial hypoplasia should not be used for breeding.

==History==
The condition seems to be most commonly found in cats along the eastern coast of the United States and in South West England. Some sources state that these cats are rare in Europe because they were killed as witches' familiars,<ref name="straightdope"></ref> but other sources indicate that they are quite common in England. <ref name="messybeast"></ref>  Polydactyl Cats are very common in the Cardigan area of Wales and are known as Cardi-Cats. A Canadian cat called Tiger was recognised by Guinness World Records as having the highest number of toes on a cat, with 27 toes. <ref>[http://www.fatcats.com/html_site/yourcat.shtml Fat Cat, Inc. - Your Cat Magazine Articles!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Although there is some controversy over whether the commonest variant of the trait originated as a mutation in New England or was brought there from England, there does seem to be agreement that it spread widely as a result of cats carried on ships originating in Boston, and the prevalence of polydactylism among the cat population of various ports correlates with the dates when they first established trade with Boston.<ref name="straightdope" /><ref name="messybeast" />  Contributing to the spread of polydactyl cats by this means, sailors were long-known to especially value polydactyl cats for their extraordinary climbing and hunting abilities as an aid in controlling shipboard rodents. Some sailors also considered them to be extremely good luck when at sea.

==Breeds and Varieties==
Nobel Prize-winning author Ernest Hemingway was one of the more famous lovers of polydactyl cats, after being first given a six-toed cat by a ship's captain. Upon Hemingway's death in 1961, his former home in Key West, Florida, became a museum and a home for his cats, and it currently houses approximately sixty descendants of his cats (about half of which are polydactyl).  Because of his love for these animals, '''Hemingway cat''', or simply '''Hemingway''', is a slang term which has come to describe polydactyls (Michael Palin describes one such cat named "Bill Clinton" he found at a former residence of Hemingway's in Key West during the filming of his "Hemingway Adventure" special<ref name=""palin"></ref>).
