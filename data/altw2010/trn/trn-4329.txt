'''John Cornelius Ray''' (born California Angels of the American League.

Ray played his college ball for the University of Arkansas, finishing up in the 1979 College World Series for the runner-up Razorbacks. Ray was taken by the Houston Astros in the 12th round of the amateur baseball draft. He was traded to the Pirates on August 311981 by the Astros along with Randy Niemann for Phil Garner.

Ray immediately became the Pirates starting second baseman. As a rookie in 1982 he played in every game and was named the Rookie of the Year by ''The Sporting News''. In a controversial vote, the Baseball Writers Association of America named Steve Sax of the Los Angeles Dodgers the Rookie of the Year.

Ray continued his productive hitting, leading the league in doubles in 1983 and 1984. He won the Silver Slugger Award for second baseman in 1983. He finished fifth in the league in batting average in 1984. The switch-hitting Ray was consistently one of the most difficult batters to strike out.

In an ill-advised trade, the Pirates, going with a youth movement, traded Ray to the Angels on Miguel García and Bill Merrifield. García had a brief career in the Major Leagues and Merrifield never made it out of the minors. Meanwhile, after narrowly missing making the All-Star team during a couple of seasons, Ray was finally chosen to the American League All-Star team in 1988.

Later in his career, Ray demonstrated his versatility by playing some games in left field. This career path has been followed by a few other second basemen, such as Alfonso Soriano.
