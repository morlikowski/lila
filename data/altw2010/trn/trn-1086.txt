'''Pixar Animation Studios''' is a CGI CGI-animated feature films which are created with Renderman image-rendering API used to generate high-quality images. Pixar is now seen as the most influential studio in animation and is known for its high quality stories.

It was founded in 1979 as a division of Apple co-founder all-stock transaction worth US$7.4 billion.

==History==
===Early history===
thumb|right|350px|Pixar's studio lot in Emeryville.
Pixar was founded as the Graphics Group, one third of the Computer Division of Dr. Ed Catmull from the The Works''. When the group moved to Lucasfilm, the team worked on creating the precursor to RenderMan, called Motion Doctor, which allowed traditional cel animators to use computer animation with minimal training.<ref name="pixar story" />

The team began working on film sequences produced by Lucasfilm or worked collectively with Apple Computer.<ref></ref> Jobs paid $5 million to Return of the Jedi'' and the disastrous box-office performance of ''Howard the Duck''.<ref name="pixar story" /> The newly independent company was headed by Dr. Edwin Catmull, President and CEO, and Dr. Alvy Ray Smith, Executive Vice President and Director. Jobs served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pixar.<ref></ref>

Initially, Pixar was a high-end CAPS project, using the machine and custom software to migrate the laborious Ink and Paint part of the 2-D animation process to a more automated and thus efficient method. The Image Computer never sold well.<ref name="ohio" /> In a bid to drive sales of the system, Pixar employee John Lasseter&mdash;who had long been creating short demonstration animations, such as ''Luxo Jr.'', to show off the device's capabilities&mdash;premiered his creations at SIGGRAPH, the computer graphics industry's largest convention, to great fanfare.<ref name="ohio"></ref>

As poor sales of Pixar's computers threatened to put the company out of business, Lasseter's animation department began producing computer-animated commercials for outside companies. Early successes included campaigns for Tropicana, LifeSavers.<ref></ref> During this period, Pixar continued its relationship with re-incorporated on December 9, 1995.<ref></ref>

===Disney===
Pixar and Disney had disagreements after the production of ''marketing and distribution.  Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected a distribution fee.  The lack of story and sequel rights were perhaps the most onerous to Pixar and set the stage for a contentious relationship.<ref></ref>

The two companies attempted to reach a new agreement in early 2004. The new deal would be only for distribution, as Pixar intended to control production and own the resulting film properties themselves. The company also wanted to finance their films on their own and collect 100 percent of the profits, paying Disney only the 10 to 15 percent distribution fee.<ref name="autogenerated1"></ref>  More importantly, as part of any distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in production under their old agreement, including ''Cars''.   These conditions were unacceptable to Disney, but Pixar would not concede.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Disagreements between Steve Jobs and Disney Chairman and CEO Michael Eisner made the negotiations more difficult than they otherwise might have been.  They broke down completely in mid-2004, with Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney.<ref></ref>  Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors, since other partners saw Pixar's terms as too demanding. After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September of 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for their major releases during the Christmas shopping season.  An added benefit of delaying ''Cars'' was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract to see how things would play out between the two companies.<ref></ref>

Pending the Disney acquisition of Pixar, the two companies created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of ''Ratatouille'', in case the acquisition fell through, to ensure that this one film would still be released through Disney's distribution channels. (In contrast to the earlier Disney/Pixar deal ''Ratatouille'' was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee.) The completion of Disney's Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement.<ref></ref>

===Acquisition by Disney===
Disney announced on all-stock deal. Following Pixar shareholder approval, the acquisition was completed May 5, 2006. The transaction catapulted Steve Jobs, who was the majority shareholder of Pixar with 50.1%, to Disney's largest individual shareholder with 7% and a new seat on its board of directors.<ref name="agrees"></ref> Jobs' new Disney holdings outpace holdings belonging to ex-CEO Michael Eisner, the previous top shareholder who still held 1.7%, and Disney Director Emeritus Roy E. Disney who held almost 1% of the corporation's shares. Roy Disney's criticisms of Eisner included the soured Pixar relationship and accelerated Eisner's ouster.<ref name="buys pixar"></ref>

As part of the deal, Lasseter, Pixar Executive Chief Creative Officer (reporting to President and CEO theme parks.<ref name="agrees" /> Catmull retained his position as President of Pixar, while also becoming President of Disney Studios, reporting to Bob Iger and Walt Disney Studio Entertainment. Steve Jobs' position as Pixar's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was also removed, and instead he took a place on the Disney board of directors.<ref name="buys pixar" />
