'''Archery''' is the practice of using a bow to shoot arrows. Archery has historically been used in hunting and combat and has become a precision sport. A person practicing archery is called an ''archer'', and one who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called a ''toxophilite''.

==History==
thumb|right|200px|Hoops rolled with sticks, such as this, were widely used as targets by indigenous archers in North America.

The bow seems to have been invented in the late Paleolithic or early Mesolithic. The oldest indication for its use in Europe comes from the Stellmoor in the Ahrensburg valley north of Hamburg, Germany and date from the late Paleolithic Hamburgian culture (9000-8000 BC). The arrows were made of pine and consisted of a mainshaft and a 15-20&nbsp;centimetre (6-8&nbsp;inches) long foreshaft with a flint point. There are no known definite earlier bows; previous pointed shafts are known, but may have been launched by atlatls rather than bows. 

The oldest bows known so far come from the Holmeg√•rd swamp in ft) long. Bows of Holmegaard-type were in use until the Bronze Age; the convexity of the midsection has decreased with time.

Corylus avellana''), wayfaring tree (''Viburnum lantana'') and other small woody shoots. Some still have flint arrow-heads preserved; others have blunt wooden ends for hunting birds and small game. The ends show traces of fletching, which was fastened on with birch-tar.

Bows and arrows have been present in Egyptian culture since its predynastic origins. The nine bows symbolize the various peoples that had been ruled over by the pharaoh since Egypt was united.

In the PPN A shouldered Khiam-points may well be arrowheads.

The bow was one of the earliest forms of artillery. Bows eventually replaced the atlatl as the predominant means for launching projectiles.

Classical Persians, Indians, Japanese, Koreans, and Chinese fielded large numbers of archers in their armies. Arrows were destructive against massed formations, and the use of archers often proved decisive. The Sanskrit term for archery, dhanurveda, came to refer to martial arts in general.

During the Middle Ages, archery in warfare was not as prevalent and dominant in Western Europe as popular myth sometimes dictates. Archers were quite often the lowest-paid soldiers in an army or were conscripted from the peasantry. This was due to the cheap nature of the bow and arrow, as compared to the expense needed to equip a professional man-at-arms with good armour and a sword. Professional archers required a lifetime of training and expensive bows to be effective, and were thus rare in Europe (see English longbow).

Archery was highly developed in Korean civilizations were well-known for their archery skills,<ref name="KA">[http://www.turtlepress.com/info_korean_archery.asp Korean archery] at [http://www.turtlepress.com turtlepress.com]</ref><ref>[http://anthromuseum.missouri.edu/grayson/koreanarchery/koreaarchery.shtml Korea archery] at [http://anthromuseum.missouri.edu anthromuseum.missouri.edu]</ref> and Equestrian Nomads. Central Asian and American Plains tribesmen were extremely adept at archery on horseback. 

===Decline, last uses, and survival of archery===

The advent of firearms eventually rendered bows obsolete in warfare. Despite the high social status, ongoing utility, and widespread pleasure of archery in England, Japan, Korea, China, Turkey, Armenia, America, Egypt, and elsewhere, almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely, to the relative neglect of archery.  Early firearms were vastly inferior in rate-of-fire, and were very susceptible to wet weather. However, they had longer effective range<ref>Korean Traditional Archery. Duvernay TA, Duvernay NY. Handong Global University, 2007</ref> and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions. They also required significantly less training to use properly, in particular penetrating steel armour without any need to develop special mounted archery was more effective than muzzle-loading guns. (Other Plains Indians fought mostly on foot, and usually found guns to be superior weapons when they did so.) "After... about 1800, most Comanches began to discard muskets and pistols and to rely on their older weapons."<ref>T.R. Fehrenbach. Comanches, the history of a people. Vintage Books. London, 2007. ISBN 9780099520559. First published in the USA by Alfred Knopf, 1974. Page 125.</ref> Repeating firearms, however, were superior in turn, and the Comanches adopted them when they could. Bows remained effective hunting weapons for skilled horse archers, used to some extent by all Native Americans on the Great Plains to hunt buffalo as long as there were buffalo to hunt. The last Comanche hunt was in 1878, and it failed for lack of buffalo.<ref>T.R. Fehrenbach. Comanches, the history of a people. Vintage Books. London, 2007. ISBN 9780099520559. First published in the USA by Alfred Knopf, 1974. Page 553.</ref>  

The last recorded use of bows, in an English battle, seems to have been a skirmish at Jacobite cause, and the Korea and 1904 in China. Ongoing use of bows and arrows in some African conflicts has been reported in the 21st century, and the Sentinelese still use bows as part of a lifestyle scarcely touched by outside contact. A remote group in Brazil, recently photographed from the air, aimed bows at the aeroplane.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7427417.stm</ref> Bows and arrows have seen considerable use in the 2008 ethnic clashes in Kenya. 

Traditional archery remained in minority use for sport and for hunting in many areas long after its military disuse. In Turkey, its last revival for this purpose took place with the encouragement of Emperor Gojong, and is the basis of a popular modern sport. Japanese continue to make and use their unique traditional equipment. Among the Cherokees and the British, popular use of longbows never entirely died out. In China, the revival of archery continued until the Cultural Revolution, when it was suppressed; the last of the traditional Chinese bowmakers is now working again.<ref>http://www.atarn.org/chinese/juyuan/juyuan.htm Ju Yuan Hao</ref> In modern times, mounted archery continues to be practiced in some Asian countries but is not used in international competition. Modern Hungarians have revived mounted archery as a competitive sport.<ref>[http://www.atarn.org/magyar/magyar_link.htm Magyar index<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Archery is the national sport of the Kingdom of Bhutan.<ref>[http://www.atarn.org/tibet_bhutan/bhutan/bhutan01.htm Bhutanese Traditional Archery<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== Modern primitive archery===

After the American Civil War, two Confederate veterans, Maurice and Will Thompson, revived archery in America. The two brothers and Thomas Williams (a former slave) lived in the wild in the Georgia. As ex-Confederate soldiers they were not allowed to own guns, so they needed other ways to hunt for food. For some reason, Thomas Williams knew something about English-style Archery (using a longbow) and showed Maurice and Will. Later, Maurice wrote a book, "The Witchery of Archery," which became a best seller and enthused people about the sport of archery. In 1879 the National Archery Association was formed. However, public interest in archery soon subsided.

That all changed when Ishi came out of hiding in California in 1911. Ishi was the last of the Yahi Indian tribe. Once he came out of hiding, he was extensively studied and then lived at the University of California at Berkeley Anthropology Museum.<ref>Ishi in Two Worlds: A Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America (Paperback)
by Theodora Kroeber. Republished University of California Press 2004. ISBN-10: 0520240375 ISBN-13: 978-0520240377</ref>  His medical caretaker, Dr. Saxton Pope, was an instructor of surgery at the school. Dr. Pope was very interested in Ishi and his culture, especially archery. Ishi willingly taught Dr. Pope about his culture, how to make tools the way the Yahi did, and how to hunt using a bow and arrow. Soon, Dr. Pope was joined by archery-enthusiast Arthur Young.  

Ishi's time was short however, and he died in 1916 of tuberculosis. Dr. Pope and Mr. Young did not lose interest in archery, and set about proving that archery could be used to bag large game.<ref>Saxton POPE. Hunting with the bow and arrow. New York. G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1925.</ref>  They hunted in Alaska and Africa and took several large game animals.<ref>Saxton POPE. 
Adventurous bowmen. Field Notes On African Archery. G. P. Putnam's Sons. New York. 1926.</ref>

Because Dr. Pope and Mr. Young demonstrated to Western society that archery was effective on not only small game, but large game as well, archery did not lose public interest so easily. Many methods that Ishi taught Dr. Pope are still used today by primitive archers. From the 1920s, professional engineers took an interest in archery, previously the exclusive field of traditional craft experts.<ref>Hickman, C.N., Forrest Nagler and Paul E. Klopsteg. Archery: The Technical Side. A compilation of scientific and technical articles on theory, construction, use and performance of bows and arrows, reprinted from journals of science and of archery. National Field Archery Association 1947</ref> They led the commercial development of new forms of bow including the modern recurve and compound bow. These modern forms are now dominant in modern Western archery; traditional bows are in a minority. In the 1980s, the skills of traditional archery were revived by American enthusiasts, and combined with the new scientific understanding. Much of this expertise is available in the "Traditional Bowyer's Bible" (see bibliography).

===Mythology===
Archers and archery play a role in several mythologies, including Greek Arash, were all archers. Earlier Greek representations of Zhou Tong features in many fictional forms. Cupid, the Roman god of love, is always depicted as an archer. 

==Equipment==
===Types of bows===

While there is great variety in the construction details of bows (both historic and modern) all bows consist of a string attached to elastic limbs that store mechanical energy imparted by the user drawing the string.

Bows may be broadly split into those drawn by pulling the string directly and those that use a mechanism to pull the string.

Directly drawn bows may be further divided based upon differences in limb construction. Bows with relatively straight limbs include the bow shape resulting from this curvature.

A compound bow is a simply drawn bow designed to reduce the force required to hold the string taut. Most compound designs use cams or elliptical wheels on the ends of the limbs.  The cams on a compound bow are engineered in such a way that the archer can hold twice as much draw weight for an extended period of time.  Although the archer starts the draw at full weight, there is a 65%-75% let-off at full draw. For example,  a bow set at sixty pounds would allow the archer to draw 60 lbs. for a short period but hold 65-75% less than that at full draw.   

Mechanically drawn bows typically have a stock or other mounting, such as the crossbow. They are not limited by the strength of a single archer, and larger varieties have been used as siege engines.

===Types of arrows and fletching===

A normal arrow consists of shaft with an arrowhead attached to the front end, with fletchings and a nock at the other. Shafts are usually made of solid Easton X10 and A/C/E.

The arrowhead is the primary functional part of the arrow, and plays the largest role in determining its purpose. Some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but it is far more common for separate arrowheads to be made, usually from metal, stone, or some other hard material. The most commonly-used forms are target points, field points, and broadheads, although there are also other types, like bodkin, judo, and blunts.

flu-flus''. Misplacement of fletchings can often change the arrow's flight path dramatically.

===Bow string===

Dacron and other modern materials offer high strength for their weight and are used on most modern bows. Linen and other traditional materials are still used on traditional bows. Almost any fiber can be made into a bow string. The author of "Arab Archery" suggests the hide of a young, emaciated camel.<ref>Arab Archery. An Arabic manuscript of about A.D. 1500 "A book on the excellence of the bow & arrow" and the description thereof. Translated and edited by Nabih Amin Faris and Robert Potter Elmer. Princeton University Press 1945 http://www.sacred-archery.com/arab%20archery%20anno%20domini%201500.pdf</ref>  Nj√°l's saga famously describes the refusal of a wife, Hallger√∞ur, to cut her hair in order to make an emergency bowstring for her husband, Gunnar H√°mundarson, who is then killed.

===Protective equipment===

Most archers wear a bracer (also known as an arm-guard) to protect the inside of the bow arm and prevent clothing from catching the bow string. The Navajo people have developed highly-ornamented bracers as non-functional items of adornment.<ref>[http://www.millicentrogers.org/ketoh.htm ketoh<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Some archers also wear protection on their chests, called chestguards. Chestguards are to prevent the bowstring from being obstructed by the archer's body or clothing as it is released. They also protect the archer. Roger Ascham mentions one archer, presumably with an unusual shooting style, who wore a leather guard for his face.<ref> Toxophilus - the School of Shooting. by Roger Ascham. Read Books 2006. ISBN-10: 1846643694 ISBN-13: 978-1846643699</ref>

The drawing fingers, or thumb in the case of archers using the thumb or Mongolian draw, are normally protected by a leather tab, glove, or thumb ring. A simple tab of leather is commonly used, as is a skeleton glove. Medieval Europeans probably used a complete leather glove.<ref>The Great Warbow. Hardy R, Strickland M. Sutton Publishing 2005. 
ISBN-10: 0750931671
ISBN-13: 978-0750931670</ref> Eurasiatic archers using the Mongolian draw protected their thumbs, usually with leather according to the author of "Arab Archery", but also with special rings of various hard materials. Many surviving Turkish and Chinese examples are works of considerable art; some are so highly ornamented that they could not have been used to loose an arrow. Presumably these were items of personal adornment. In traditional Japanese archery a special glove is used, provided with a ridge which is used to draw the string.

===Release aids===
Archers using compound bows usually use a release aid to hold the string steadily and release it precisely. This attaches to the bowstring at the nocking point and permits the archer to release the string by pulling a trigger. The "trigger" may be an actual trigger lever which is depressed by a finger or thumb (or held then released) but it may also be some other mechanism. Hydraulic and mechanical time delay triggers have been used, as have "back tension" triggers which are operated by either a change in the position of the release or "true back tension"; that is to say the release triggers when a pre-determined draw weight is reached. A mechanical release aid permits a single point of contact on the string instead of three fingers. This allows less deformity in the string at full draw, as well as providing a more consistent release than can be achieved by human fingers.

==Shooting technique and form==
The bow is held in the hand opposite to the archer's dominant eye, though holding the bow in the dominant hand side is advocated by some. This hand is referred to as the '''bow hand''' and its arm the '''bow arm'''. The opposite hand is called the '''drawing hand''' or '''string hand'''. Terms such as '''bow shoulder''' or '''string elbow''' follow the same convention. Right-eye-dominant archers hold the bow with their left hand, have their left side facing the target, sight towards the target with their right eye and handle the arrow and string with their right hand.

===Modern international competitive form===
To shoot an arrow, an archer first assumes the correct stance. The body should be perpendicular to the target and the shooting line, with the feet placed shoulder-width apart. As an archer progresses from beginner to a more advanced level an 'open stance' is used/developed. Each archer will have a particular preference but mostly this term indicates that the leg furthest from the shooting line will be a half to a whole foot-length in front of the other, on the ground.  

To load, the bow is pointed toward the ground and the shaft of the arrow is placed on an arrow rest which is attached in the bow window. The back of the arrow is attached to the bowstring with the 'nock' (a small plastic component which is typified by a 'v' groove for this purpose). This is called ''nocking the arrow.'' Typical arrows with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane is pointing away from the bow. In years past there was normally a vane with a different color, called "the odd vane out" or "the nocking vane". However, most modern archers tend to use same color vanes; as different dyes can give varying stiffness to vanes. This results in less precision.

The bowstring and arrow are held with three fingers. When using a sight, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below. The string is usually placed in either the first or second joint of the fingers.

The bow is then raised and drawn. This is often one fluid motion which tends to vary from archer to archer. The string hand is drawn towards the face, where it should rest lightly at an ''anchor point''. This point is consistent from shot to shot and is usually at the corner of the mouth or on the chin. The bow arm is held outwards toward the target. The elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is parallel to the ground though Archers with hyper extendable elbows tend to angle the inner elbow toward the ground as exemplified by the Korean archer Jang Yong Ho.

In proper form, the archer stands erect, forming a 'T'. The archer's lower trapezius muscles are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point. Some bows will be equipped with a mechanical device, called a clicker, which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length. 

The arrow is typically released by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand(see Bow draw). An archer should pay attention to the recoil or ''follow through'' of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique).

==Aiming methods==
There are two main forms of aiming in archery: using the sight picture or not. 

The sight picture includes the target and the bow, as seen at the same time by the archer. With a fixed "anchor point" (where the string is brought to, or close to, the face), and a fully extended bow arm, successive shots taken with the sight picture in the same position will fall on the same point. This allows the archer to adjust aim with successive shots in order to achieve a good standard of accuracy. It cannot be used with short bows, which by definition do not allow a full draw. Modern archery equipment usually includes sights which mark the predicted impact point. Sight picture aiming is universally used with modern equipment and also by many archers who use traditional bows. It allows good accuracy to be achieved after a moderate amount of practice. 

When using shortbows, or shooting from horseback, it is difficult to use the sight picture. The archer may look at the target but without including the weapon in the field of accurate view. Aiming involves the same sort of coordination between vision  and motion that is used when throwing. With sufficient practice, such archers can normally achieve good practical accuracy for hunting or for war. Aiming without a sight picture may allow more rapid shooting. 

'''Instinctive shooting''' is a term often used, but there is no agreed definition. Some use it to mean shooting with a sight picture but without giving it conscious attention. Others use it to mean shooting without a sight picture.

== Physics ==

Bows function by converting elastic hysteresis, reducing the overall amount released when the bow is shot. Of the energy remaining, some is damped both by the limbs of bow and the bowstring.  Depending on the elasticity of the arrows, some of the energy is also absorbed by compressing the arrow, causing it to "bow out" to one side.  This results in an in-flight oscillation of the arrow in which its center protrudes out to one side and then the other repeatedly.
