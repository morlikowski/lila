==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Bill Everett spent his early life in Steranko, Jim. ''The Steranko History of Comics - Volume One''<!--title as per copyright page--> (Supergraphics, 1970), p. 59. The book's Everett interview closely coincides with a letter from Everett to The Herald-Traveler'' for $12 a week.<ref name=js59 /> Soon afterward, he left to become a draftsmen for the civil engineering firm The Brooks System, in Newton, Massachusetts.<ref name=js59 /> From there he pursued work in Phoenix, Arizona and Los Angeles, California without success. He returned East, to New York City, where he again did newspaper advertising art, for the ''New York Herald-Tribune''.<ref name=js59 /> He next became art editor for Teck Publications' ''Radio News'' magazine, then assistant art director under Herm Bollin in Chicago, Illinois.<ref name=js59 /> Fired for being, as Everett described, "too cocky", he returned to New York where sought employment as an art director. With no luck at this, and desperate for work, he ran into an old Teck colleague, Walter Holze, who was now working in the new field of comic books. As Everett recalled in the late 1960s, "He asked me if I could do comics. I said, 'Sure!!' At that point I was starving. I wasn't interested in the comics business; I was talked into it".<ref name=js59 />

Freelancing for Amazing-Man at Centaur, working with company art director Lloyd Jacquet, and drew the first five issues.<ref name=js59 /> 

Everett and other creators followed Jacquet to his new company Funnies, Inc., one of the first comic-book "packagers" that would create comics on demand for publishers. Everett recalled, "I left Centaur with Lloyd Jacquet and another chap whose name as Max; I cannot remember his last name. Lloyd... had an idea that he wanted to start his own art service — to start a small organization to supply artwork and editorial material to publishers. ... He asked me to join him. He also asked Carl Burgos. So we were the nucleus...."<ref name=ae>Bill Everett interview, originally published in ''Alter Ego'' #11, 1978; reprinted in ''Alter Ego'' vol. 3, #46 (March 2005); p. 8 of the latter.</ref> He added, "I don't know how to explain it, but I was still on a freelance basis. That was the agreement we had. The artists, including myself, at Funnies, worked on a freelance basis".<ref name=ae />

===Sub-Mariner===
At Funnies, Inc., Everett created the Sub-Mariner for an aborted project, ''Martin Goodman. The original eight-page story was expanded by four pages for ''Marvel Comics'' #1 (Oct. 1939), the first publication of what Goodman would eventually call Human Torch and Jack Kirby & Joe Simon's Captain America. Everett soon introduced such supporting characters as New York City policewoman Betty Dean, a steady companion and occasional love-interest, and Namor's cousin Namora.

Everett drew his star character in ''Sub-Mariner Comics'', published first quarterly, then thrice-yearly and finally bimonthly, for issues #1-32 (Fall 1941 - June 1949).

Everett entered the European theater of operations, and their first child, a daughter, was born shortly before Everett was shipped out to the Pacific theater; he returned home in February 1946.<ref name=js60 /> With some money inherited from a great-uncle, Everett took some time off and traveled before settling in The Human Torch'', ''Blonde Phantom Comics''.

Additionally, he drew the title feature in the three-issue spin-off series ''Namora'' (Aug.-Dec. 1948).

===Atlas Comics===
By now, Timely Comics had evolved into Marvel's 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics. Like most superhero characters in the postwar era, the Sub-Mariner had faded in popularity,  and his solo title had been canceled in 1949. But after a nearly five-year hiatus, he briefly returned with Human Torch in ''Young Men #24'' (Dec. 1953), during Atlas' mid-1950s attempt at reviving superheroes. Everett drew the Sub-Mariner feature through ''Young Men'' #28 (June 1954) and in ''Sub-Mariner Comics'' #33-42 (April 1954 - Oct. 1955), which outlasted the other two characters' features. During this time, Namora had her own spin-off series.

Pochi anni dopo la sua famiglia si trasferì in Arizona. Sotto la guida del padre, Everett cominciò a sviluppare un interesse per i disegni umoristici. Il padre voleva che diventasse un caricaturista, ma sfortunatamente morì prima di vedere realizzato il suo sogno. L'ammirazione di Bill per il lavoro di Milton Caniff lo indusse probabilmente ai primi approcci con il modo dei Fumetti. All'età di 15 anni, trascorse due anni nella marina mercantile e questa sua passione per l'acqua si rifletteva anche nei suoi primi fumetti. Bill sviluppò uno stile unico nel disegnare fumetti, probabilmente proprio per il fatto di avere frequentato solo per breve tempo la scuola d'arte.

Il primo lavoro fu per il Centaur line of comics. La Centaur era una compagnia minore che produceva eroi di secondo piano come The Sentinel, Ferret, "TNT" Todd, Vapo-Man, Minimidget e Ritty e molti altri. La società diede a Bill l'opportunità di lavorare su un personaggio d'avventure che molti ancora oggi considerano il suo capolavoro, superiore persino al successivo Principe Namor, il Sub-Mariner. Amazing-Man non fu il primo incarico di Bill alla nuova società. Inizialmente lavorò su un personaggio spaziale conosciuto come Skyrocket Steele. Poco dopo comunque Bill diede vita alla prima edizione di Amazing-Man.
