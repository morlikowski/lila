==Acţiunea==
Acţiunea se petrece în Turcia. 

===Actul I===

În palatul lui Selim Paşa se găsesc închise Constanţa şi camerista ei Blonda. Curând apare Belmonte, un tânăr nobil spaniol, iubitul Constanţei, sosit pentru a o elibera. Pedrillo, valetul său, prizonier şi el, îi promite ajutorul. Dar intrarea în palat îi este închisă de Osmin, căpetenia ienicerilor. Profitând de faptul că Paşa Selim este mare amator de arhitectură, Pedrillo ajuns grădinar îl recomandă pe Belmonte drept unul dintre cei mai renumiţi arhitecţi italieni ai timpului, reuşind astfel să-i asigure accesul în serai. Inima lui Belmonte este plină de speranţă. Constanţa, dimpotrivă, singură şi prizonieră în palat, îşi cântă dragostea pe care o crede pierdută. 

'''''Die Entführung aus dem Serail''''' (K. 384; ''The Abduction from the Seraglio''; also known as ''Il Seraglio'') is an German libretto is by Christoph Friedrich Bretzner with adaptations by Gottlieb Stephanie. The plot concerns the attempt of the hero Belmonte, assisted by his servant Pedrillo, to rescue his beloved Konstanze from the seraglio of the Pasha Selim.

==The origin of the opera==
The company that first sponsored the opera was the ''Nationalsingspiel'' ("national Joseph II. The Emperor had set up the company to perform works in the German language (Italian opera was already popular in Vienna). This project was ultimately given up as a failure, but along the way it produced a number of successes, mostly a series of translated works. Mozart's opera emerged as its outstanding original success.<ref>Manning 1982</ref>

The inspector of the ''Nationalsingspiel'' was Bretzner. The latter later complained loudly and publicly about the theft.<ref>Deutsch 1965</ref>

==Composition==
Mozart received the libretto from Stephanie on Leopold indicates he was very excited about the prospect of having his opera performed in Vienna, and worked enthusiastically on his project.

At first Mozart thought he needed to finish his opera in only two months, because tentative plans were made to perform it at the September visit of the Russian Grand Duke Paul (son of Catherine the Great and heir to the Russian throne). However, it was ultimately decided to perform operas by Gluck instead, giving Mozart more time.<ref>Braunbehrens 1990, 61</ref>

It was around this time that Mozart articulated his views about the role of the composer and the librettist in the preparation of an opera. He wrote to his father (13 October 1781):

:''I would say that in an opera the poetry must be altogether the obedient daughter of the music. Why are Italian comic operas popular everywhere -- in spite of the miserable libretti? ... Because the music reigns supreme, and when one listens to it all else is forgotten. An opera is sure of success when the plot is well worked out, the words written solely for the music and not shoved in here and there to suit some miserable rhyme ... The best thing of all is when a good composer, who understands the stage and is talented enough to make sound suggestions, meets an able poet, that true phoenix; in that case, no fears need be entertained as to the applause -- even of the ignorant.''<ref>Quoted in Braunbehrens 1990, 61-62</ref>

It would seem that something along these lines did happen--that is, Mozart decided to play a major role in the shaping of the libretto, insisting that Stephanie make changes for dramatic and musical effect. On September 26 Mozart wrote:

:''Now comes the rub! The first act was finished more than three weeks ago, as was also one aria in Act II and the drunken duet ''["Vivat Bacchus", Act II]'' ... But I cannot compose any more, because the whole story is being altered -- and, to tell the truth, at my own request. At the beginning of Act III there is a charming quintet or rather finale, but I would prefer to have it at the end of Act II. In order to make this practicable, great changes must be made, in fact an entirely new plot must be introduced -- and Stephanie is up to his neck in other work. So we must have a little patience.''<ref>Quoted in Braunbehrens 1990, 77-78</ref>

Mozart was evidently quite pleased to have in Stephanie a librettist who would listen to him. The September 26 letter also says:

:''Everyone abuses Stephanie. It may be the case he is only friendly to my face. But after all he is preparing the libretto for me -- and, what is more, exactly as I want it -- and by Heaven, I don't ask anything more of him.''<ref>Quoted in Braunbehrens 1990, 62</ref>

With the delays for rewriting, the composition took several more months. The premiere took place on July 16, 1782, at the Burgtheater in Vienna.

==The character of the opera==
''Die Entführung aus dem Serail'' is in the genre of "Singspiel", meaning that much of the action is carried forward by spoken dialogue, thus the music lacks recitatives and consists entirely of set numbers.

The work is lighthearted and meant for fun, with little of the deeper character exploration or darker feelings found in Mozart's later operas.<ref>This opinion is given, for instance, in Manning 1982</ref> It played off a contemporary enthusiasm for the "exotic" culture of the Siege of Vienna in 1683. Later in the decade, Austria was again at war with Turkey (see Janissary band music, that he had employed in earlier work; see Turkish music (style). Like most comedies of the time, it utilizes many elements in plot and characterization that were first established by the Commedia dell'Arte.

The characters of the opera play off Turkish stereotypes, notably Osmin, the Pasha's comically sinister overseer. However, the opera cannot be entirely considered as stereotyping of the Turks, since the climax of the plot depends on a rather selfless act on the part of the Pasha.<ref>Others have suggested that the Pasha is portrayed and positively valorised for acting like a Christian (this argument is made in Matthew Head - ''Orientalism, Masquerade and Mozart's Turkish Music'', and possibly implied by Mary Hunter who says that he is 'represented as European by his act of mercy' (in 'The ''Alla Turca'' Style' in Jonathan Bellman (ed) - ''The Exotic in Western Music'')).</ref>

The music includes some of the composer's most spectacular and difficult arias. Osmin's Act III aria "Wie will ich triumphiren" includes characteristic 18th century coloratura passage work, and twice goes down to a low D, the lowest note demanded of any voice in opera. Perhaps the most famous aria in the opera is the long and elaborate "Martern aller Arten" ("Tortures of all kinds") for Konstanze, an outstanding challenge for sopranos. Konstanze sings in a kind of sinfonia concertante with four solo players from the orchestra; the strikingly long orchestral introduction, without stage action, also poses problems for stage directors.<ref>The issue is discussed in Rosen (1997).</ref> 

The virtuosity of these roles is perhaps attributable to the fact that when he took up the task of composing the opera, Mozart already knew the outstanding reputations of the singers for whom he was writing, and he tailored the arias to their strengths.<ref name="abert" /> The first Osmin was Ludwig Fischer, a bass noted for his wide range and skill in leaping over large intervals with ease. Similarly, Mozart wrote of the first Konstanze, Catarina Cavalieri, "I have sacrificed Konstanze's aria a little to the flexible throat of Mlle. Cavalieri."

==Reception==
The opera was a huge success. The first two performances brought in the large sum of 1200 florins, three times what Mozart's salary had been for his old job in Salzburg.<ref>Deutsch 1965, 201</ref> The work was repeatedly performed in Vienna during Mozart's lifetime,<ref>For a listing see Deutsch 1965, 201</ref> and throughout German-speaking Europe.<ref>See the index entry for the opera in Deutsch 1965</ref>. In 1787, Goethe wrote (concerning his own efforts as a librettist):

:''All our endeavour ... to confine ourselves to what is simple and limited was lost when Mozart appeared. ''Die Entführung aus dem Serail'' conquered all, and our own carefully written piece has never been so much as mentioned in theater circles.''<ref>Quoted from Deutsch 1965, 305. The work of his own to which Goethe refers is his ''Scherz, List und Rache''.</ref>

The complexity of Mozart's music also plays a role in an oft-retold tale about the work. In the version from ''Bartlett's Book of Anecdotes'', the story goes like this:

:''The Emperor Joseph II commissioned the creation of ''The abduction from the Seraglio'', but when he heard it, he complained to Mozart, "That is too fine for my ears - there are too many notes." Mozart replied, "There are just as many notes as there should be."''
