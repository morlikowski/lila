'''Orange County Blue Star''' ist ein US-amerikanischer Fußballverein aus Irvine (Kalifornien). Die Mannschaft wurde 1997 gegründet.

==Geschichte==

Bis 2001 spielte man in der USL First Division, der zweithöchsten Liga, als Orange County Zodiac bzw. Orange County Waves. 

2001 wurde der Name dann in Orange County Blue Star geändert und seitdem spielte man zwei Klassen tiefer in der USL Premier Development League, der vierthöchsten amerikanischen Liga. Dort konnte man bislang dreimal die Regular Season in der Conference SouthWest gewinnen. Die Blue Stars schafften es aber nie weiter als das Viertelfinale in den Playoffs.

2003 spielte Jürgen Klinsmann als ''Jay Goppingen'' für die Blue Stars nach seinem offiziellen Karriereende. Er machte 8 Spiele für die Kalifornier und erzielte dabei 5 Tore. Außerdem spielte Ryan Coiner, ehemaliger Spieler von Holstein Kiel und dem 1. FC Union Berlin, in seiner Jugend für den Verein.

==Competition History==
===Zodiac Professional Era===
thumb|right|Original Orange County Zodiac logo
thumb|right|Original Orange County Blue Star logo
Blue Star began life as '''Orange County Zodiac''' in the USISL A-League in 1997, finishing fifth in the Pacific Conference in their inaugural season, with Seattle Sounders in the Round of 16. They changed their name to '''Orange County Waves''' prior to the 2000 season, their final one in the A-League, but finished rock bottom of the Pacific Conference, and took the 2000-01 offseason to consider their options. 

===Drop to PDL; Blue Star is Born===
The club dropped down to the PDL in 2001 and changed their name again, and the newly-christened Blue Star immediately enjoyed success. They finished their first year in the fourth tier as Champions of the Southwest division, but were defeated by eventual championship runners-up, BYU Cougars which featured a hat trick by Ryan Coiner. 

2003 was also a landmark due to the participation of a certain German player called Jay Goppingen, who played eight games and scored five goals for Blue Star. Goppingen was actually the pseudonym used by former VfB Stuttgart, Inter Milan, Bayern Munich and Tottenham Hotspur striker Jürgen Klinsmann who, following his relocation from Europe to California, decided he wanted to keep playing for a year or so, just for fun, and to impart his wisdom to Orange County's young soccer players. Klinsmann was born in the city of Göppingen in Baden-Württemberg.
