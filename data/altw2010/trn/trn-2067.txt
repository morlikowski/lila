'''AllOfMP3''', '''MP3Sparks''' e '''MemphisMembers''' sono marchi di un negozio di musica in rete di Mediaservices, un'azienda fondata nel Mosca in Russia.
I negozi vendono musica codifica in formati audio non protetti (liberi dal DRM) a un costo significativamente basso rispetto agli negozi musicali della rete.

La società è stata  coinvolta in vicende legali dovute alle accuse, principalmente dalle case discografiche, di operare illegalmente e incoraggiare la pirateria musicale.

== Chiusura di AllofMP3 ==

Nel giugno 2007, AllOfMP3 fu chiuso a seguito delle pressioni dal governo russo. I visitatori del sito furono salutati da un messaggio che dichiarava che il sito  era "chiuso per manutenzione".

== MP3Sparks.com e MemphisMembers ==

Nell'aprile 2007 nascono due siti fratelli di AllofMP3: '''MP3Sparks.com''' & '''MemphisMembers'''
Hanno una grafica e un impostazione simile a AllofMP3.
MP3Sparks è licenziato da Rightholders Federation for Collective Copyright Management of Works Used Interactively ('''NP-FAIR''') a differenza di AllofMP3 che era sotto Russian Organization for Multimedia and Digital Systems ('''ROMS''').

== MP3fiesta.com e ZML.com ==

Di recente nasce il sito '''MP3fiesta.com''' , dal quale si possono trovare 25mila artisti, oltre 1 milione di tracce musicali e 100mila album .
Viene anche lanciato il sito ZML.com dove vengono venduti oltre 1500 film in qualità DVD al prezzo di 1,99 dollari senza DRM i cui diritt vengono pagati alla ROMS.

'''AllOfMP3''', '''MP3Sparks''' and '''MemphisMembers''' are brands of non-protected audio formats at a significantly lower cost than other online music stores.  As of 2008, the original AllOfMp3 site has been replaced by a blog.  The MP3Sparks site still appears to be a fully operational music download store.  The site experiences occasional periods when it cannot be accessed for several days at a time. As of June 17th 2008, MP3Sparks is still functional.

The company has been plagued by legal issues for some time due to accusations, mainly from the record industry, that they are operating illegally and engaging in music piracy.  For at least the past two months, members of the MP3Sparks website have been, and continue to be, unable to add money to their accounts.  There is no foreseeable conclusion to this problem.
== Revenue ==

Run by the Moscow company MediaServices, AllOfMP3 had an estimated revenue of US$30 million in 2006.<ref>"[http://www.nypost.com/seven/12212006/business/music_labels__nyet_to_russian_pirates_business_peter_lauria.htm Music Labels: Nyet to Russian Pirates]" New York Post, December 21, 2006</ref> According to the IFPI and various other label representatives the company has never transferred money to any (western) label.  AllofMP3 claims to have offered settlements to IFPI, which AllOfMP3 claims IFPI refused to accept.

== Legal issues ==

AllOfMP3's legality is controversial.  It is licensed in Russia by the Russian Organization for Multimedia and Digital Systems, a license similar to agreements held by Russian radio stations.  AllOfMP3 states that this agreement allows it to legally distribute music from all artists and all labels.  This is disputed by most major record labels, which generally do not recognize ROMS or believe that it has the authority to distribute their works.  AllOfMP3.com makes no claims as to its legality outside of Russia<ref>"[http://www.slate.com/id/2115868/ Barely Legal]", Slate Magazine, March 28, 2005</ref>. However it is accessible to visitors in all countries.

In 2005, Moscow authorities began investigating the site as a result of a formal complaint from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), who accused the site of "large-scale copyright infringement"<ref>"[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/22/allofmp3_probe/ Russian police probe cheap downloads site]" The Register, February 22, 2005</ref>.

On June 1, 2006, the New York Times reported that US trade negotiators have warned Russia that the continued existence of AllOfMP3 could jeopardize Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization<ref>"[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/01/world/europe/01cnd-mp3.html?ex=1306814400&en=4c9bcba30952e86b&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss Russian Download Site Is Popular and Possibly Illegal]", New York Times, June 1, 2006</ref>.

She later told reporters that "I have a hard time imagining Russia becoming a member of the WTO and having a Web site like that up and running that is so clearly a violation of everyone's intellectual property rights."<ref>"[http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6122879.html U.S. pushes Russia in WTO talks to close MP3 site]", ZDNet, October 5, 2006</ref>

Pressure from the IFPI resulted in AllOfMP3 being blocked by the Swedish ISP, Tele2 in October 2006<ref>"[http://www.russianspy.org/2006/10/27/swedish-tele2-will-block-allofmp3com/ Swedish Tele2 Will Block AllofMP3.com]" [http://www.russianspy.org/ Russian Spy], October 27 2006</ref>.

This suit is unjustified as AllofMP3 does not operate in New York. Certainly the labels are free to file any suit they wish, despite knowing full well that AllofMP3 operates legally in Russia.

In an interview with p2pnet, a MediaServices representative said "It is disappointing that United States Trade Representative Susan Schwab completely and deliberately mischaracterized AllofMP3.com. Furthermore, it is irresponsible to use AllofMP3.com as a negotiating instrument in an attempt to extract concessions from Russia in return for US support for accession to the World Trade Organization"<ref>"[http://www.p2pnet.net/story/12348 p2pnet talks to AllofMP3.com]" p2pnet, 28 May, 2007</ref>.

In August 2007, Denis Kvasov, head of the company which owned AllofMP3.com, was acquitted of all charges stemming from copyright infringement prosecution.  The prosecution was seen as a test case of Russia's commitment to fighting piracy, and was brought after EMI, NBC Universal and Time Warner lobbied for such prosecution.<ref>"[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070815/wr_nm/russia_website_dc_2  Russian court acquits music site owner]" Yahoo News August 16, 2007</ref>

that MP3Sparks.com and its associated web sites were being hosted (since December 2007)
by AbdAllah Internet, a Turkish web hosting service which allegedly provides safe harbour for spam and malware operations as well as having strong links to the
Russian Business Network.  For this reason access to the AbdAllah network is blocked by some ISPs, including all UK members of LINX, therefore blocking access to MP3Sparks as well.

On May 20, 2008, The RIAA dropped all copyright infringement charges against AllOfMP3.com.

== Closure of AllOfMP3 ==

In June 2007, AllOfMP3 was closed down following pressure from the Russian government. Visitors to the site were greeted by a message stating that the service was "closed for maintenance". MP3Sparks remained available<ref>"[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article2016297.ece Russia shuts down Allofmp3.com]" Times Online, July 2 2007</ref>, as did the AllTunes download service.

Following the acquittal of Denis Kvasov by a Moscow court in August 2007, a brief message was posted at the site's blog, stating "The service will be resumed in the foreseeable future".<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6967172.stm Russian music site to 'relaunch']" BBC News Online, August 28 2007</ref>

== MP3Sparks.com & MemphisMembers ==

In April 2007, two apparent sister sites of AllOfMP3 emerged.  Both use a layout and feel that is similar to the original AllOfMP3 website.

[http://www.mp3sparks.com/ MP3Sparks] is licensed by the [http://www.fairlaw.ru/index_eng.php Rightholders Federation for Collective Copyright Management of Works Used Interactively] (NP-FAIR), unlike AllOfMP3 which was licensed by the Russian Organization for Multimedia and Digital Systems (ROMS).  It is possible for users to create an account directly with MP3Sparks, but some users of AllOfMP3 also reported receiving an invitation to MP3Sparks - seemingly at random - when viewing their balance screen.  If the invitation was accepted, that user's history, balance and status was deleted immediately from the AllOfMP3 website and transferred over to MP3Sparks website.

MemphisMembers is available by invitation only, and users access the site through a personal subdomain address.
