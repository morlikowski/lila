'''Déols''' is a commune of the département'', in France.

Déols is an ancient town with a famous Indre. 

It preserves a fine Romanesque tower and other remains of the church the abbey, once the most important in the duchy of Berry.

==History==
Gallo-Roman vestiges confirm the age of the town of Déols, but it was only during the Middle Ages that, through the princes of Déols and Chauvigny, Déols acquired its true power.

The Benedictine abbey was founded in 917 by Ebbes the Noble, lord of Déols. A gateway flanked by towers survives from the old ramparts of the town. The parish church of St Stephen (15th and 16th centuries) has a Romanesque façade and a crypt containing the ancient Christian tomb of St Ludre and his father St Leocade, who according to tradition were lords of the town in the 4th century. There are also interesting old paintings of the 10th century representing the ancient abbey. 

The pilgrimage to the tomb of St Ludre gave importance to Déols, which under the name of ''Vicus Dolensis'' was in existence in the Roman period. In 468 the Visigoths defeated the Gauls there, the victory carrying with it the supremacy over the district of Berry. In the Middle Ages the head of the family of Dols enjoyed the title of prince and held sway over nearly all Lower Berry, of which the town itself was the capital. 

In the 10th century Raoul of Déols gave his castle to the monks of the abbey and transferred his residence to Châteauroux. For centuries this change did not affect the prosperity of the place, which was maintained by the prestige of its abbey. 

In 1187, during the war between Henry II his sons (Richard the Lionheart, Prince John) and Philip Augustus, a miracle is said to have occurred known as "Our Lady of Déols Miracle". This influenced the religious devotion of the inhabitants of the region towards the Virgin Mary.

The abbey church was burned by the religious wars and in 1626 <!--Britannica says 1622--> the abbey was suppressed by the agency of Henry II, prince of Condé and of Déols, after the monks were denounced for corruption. With the abbey in ruins, the town declined and was eclipsed by its neighbour.
