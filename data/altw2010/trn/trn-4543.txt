== Fictional character biography ==
=== Origin ===
Jack is the son of Ted Knight, who, as Starman, was a Golden Age super-hero. Although Jack was fascinated by his father's heroic life as a child, he became more and more rebellious as he grew older. By the time he reached adulthood, Jack was disdainful of his father's past. Jack's older brother David was the one who takes over his father's mantle, while Jack often regards the superhero role with open disdain.

Although Jack is shown as both schooled and talented in fine art, Jack's true passion is seen to be collectibles. He eventually becomes the owner and operator of an antique and collectible store.

Jack's role in the family changes after David is murdered by the son of the Mist, one of his father's old arch-foes. The Mist then attempts to murder Jack as well, who narrowly escapes by using one of his father's old gravity rods. Jack resolves to track down the Mist out of a desire to protect his father. He eventually kills the Mist's son in battle and captures both the Mist and his daughter Nash, who vows revenge. The Mist would later succumb to dementia after the death of his son.

=== Early Career ===
Jack reluctantly makes a deal to become Starman if his father agrees to devote his "cosmic energy research" to the betterment of mankind. Jack eschews a 'uniform', instead opting to wear his street clothes (though he eventually supplements them with a small badge with a star on it and a leather coat with a stylized star symbol on the back); his only 'superheroic' accessories are his cosmic staff and a pair of tank driver's anti-flare goggles to protect his eyes from the glare from his power rod.

Nash returns, taking her father's identity as the new Mist, in an attempt to become Jack's arch-foe. During a massive crime wave that she orchestrates, she drugs and rapes Jack , with the intent of becoming pregnant. She is successful in this, and later gives birth to Jack's son, Kyle Theo Knight, so named as Mist feels "He should have something of both our fathers in him". Mist does this in hopes of raising him to hate Jack and all he stands for.

Although Jack discovers many latent heroic qualities within, he only fully embraces them when Nash theorizes that she and Jack were two sides of the same coin. Jack vows to prove her wrong. To do so, he travels to Solomon Grundy alongside Batman, Alan Scott, the Floronic Man, and his father, and helps prove Bulletman's innocence when he is accused of being a Nazi agent during World War II.

Later Jack joins the Extant. Jack had to split his time between Opal City and the JSA's hometown of New York, making him a part-time member. He resigns from the team following his father's death and the end of his super-hero career.

Jack lives and operates out of Mikaal Tomas, an alien who had briefly operated in New York under the name Starman during the 1970s. Jack's most intriguing ally is The Shade, an immortal Golden Age super-villain who aides Jack because he considers Opal City his home and wants it to remain quiet. Over time, Jack comes to question whether or not The Shade's motives are more noble than he lets on. Jack also finds common ground with Jake "Bobo" Benetti, a retired super-strong bank robber from his father's days.

=== Among the Stars & Return to Earth ===
During his heroic career, Jack comes to fall in love with a woman he met, Sadie. When she reveals that she is the sister of Will Payton, yet another hero to bear the name of Starman, he vows to set off into space to find her missing brother.

Jack first seeks help in his journey from both Captain Marvel and the Justice League of America. Finally, equipped with his father's consciousness duplicated in a Mother Box, and joined by Mikaal Tomas, Jack sets off on an intergalactic journey. However, a chance encounter diverts Jack from his intended route, and he is lost in both time and space. He meets the Legion of Super-Heroes, counsels Jor-El, father of Superman, and then helps Adam Strange fight an invading empire.

As prisoners of the empire, Jack foments revolt to escape, working with members of the Green Lantern Corps, the Omega Men and the New Gods. Jack meets Will Payton, his body merged with the mind of yet another Starman, Prince Gavyn. Together, the many Starmen work together to save Gavyn's empire. Jack leaves Gavyn/Payton to run the empire, and returns to Earth to tell Sadie her brother's fate.

Upon his return, Jack faces almost all of his foes in a massive battle that nearly destroys Opal City. During the battle, Jack's father sacrifices himself to save the city. Following his father's death, Jack undertakes one final adventure, to resolve the mystery of the last recorded Starman, the Starman of 1951. Having the answer to that final riddle, Jack retires and takes his son to live with him and Sadie in San Francisco.

== After Jack Knight ==
Jack has passed his cosmic rod onto Courtney Whitmore, who calls herself JSA. Jack had a most recent appearance in ''Identity Crisis'' #1, a non-speaking cameo, sitting next to Stargirl at Sue Dibny's funeral.

'''''Starman''''' est un univers DC Comics. Descendant d'une lignée du héros apparue pour la première fois en 1941. Fils du premier Starman, il reprit le flambeau à contrecœur après le meurtre de son frère David (Starman #0), précédent porteur du costume.

=== Historique ===
Jack Knight a une passion : les vieux objets. Il en a fait son gagne-pain, les revendant dans sa boutique. Peu touché par la « mission » de son père et de son frère en tant que Starman, Jack va être obligé de prendre la suite de son père alors qu'un de ses anciens ennemis a décidé de tuer toute sa famille. Il réussit à abattre David et blesse Ted, le père de Jack et David. Il reprend le rôle de Starman, le protecteur d'Opal City mais décide de changer les règles : son père devra passer plus de temps à travailler sur des inventions pouvant aider le monde que sur des gadgets de super-héros. Jack lui n'interviendra que lorsque la police aura besoin de lui.

Plus tard, Jack s'intégrera au milieu des super-héros. Il sera membre de la Justice Society of America scénarisée par James Robinson puis par Geoff Johns. Jack disparaîtra des pages de l'équipe et de l'univers DC en général une fois sa série terminée. Stargirl héritera de son baton.
Depuis, le retour de Jack Knight est souvent annoncé par l'éditeur, mais rien de concret n'a été aperçu pour le moment.

Jack Knight a été aperçu dans Identity Crisis #1 à l'enterrement de Sue Dibny. Il est révelé dans l'épisode 23 de la série Manhunter qu'il vivrait à San Francisco, probablement passant son temps à peindre, vivant avec Sadie, sa compagne, et élevant leur fils.

=== Pouvoirs ===
Jack est un expert en arts martiaux, Jack compte surtout sur son bâton cosmique qui absorbe l'énergie stellaire afin de le faire voler, manipuler l'énergie, créer des champs de force ou faire léviter des objets. Après quelque temps, on apprit aussi que le bâton pouvait être commandé à distance, juste par les pensées de Jack.
