'''Jump In!''' è il 69imo USA. 

Il film, con protagonisti Corbin Bleu da ''High School Musical'' e Keke Palmer da ''Akeelah and the Bee'', parla della storia di un giovane ''boxeur'', Izzy Daniel (Corbin Bleu), che prova a seguire le orme di suo padre per vincere il Golden Glove. Quando una sua amica, Mary (Keke Palmer) gli chiede se può essere un sostituto membro del team del torneo Double Dutch, il ragazzo scopre una grande passione per il "salto a corda". 

In Disney Channel. 

== Trama ==

Izzy Daniels è e uno dei ragazzi più popolari alla sua scuola ed è destinato a divenire una star della boxe, seguendo le orme di suo padre Kenneth. Ma un giorno tutto cambia quando la ragazza che abita al piano di sopra, Mary, ha bisogno di qualche ragazzo che riempia un posto mancante nella sua squadra di double dutch (salto con due corde contemporaneamente), Joy Jumpers.

Nei primi momenti, Izzy crede che questo sport sia solo una perdita di tempo ma, con il passare del tempo, scopre quanto sia duro e artistico il lavoro in una squadra come quella di Mary.
Così Izzy appende al chiodo il guanto da boxe e decide di entrare nei Joy Jumpers, all'oscuro di suo padre e dei suoi amici; cambia nome alla squadra in Hot Chili Steppers ed insegna altre originali tecniche al resto del team.

Ma proprio alla vigilia della competizione, Rodney scopre il segreto di Izzy e lo rivela a tutti creando, nella testa del ragazzo, più confusione che mai.

Alla fine Izzy deciderà che la giusta strada da seguire è quella del suo cuore e accetta di partecipare alla gara di salto alla corda vincendo così il primo premio. Ma non sarà l'unica vittoria che otterrà.

'''''Jump In!''''' is the 69th Double Dutch tournament, then, Izzy discovers a hidden passion for jumping rope.<ref>Corbin Bleu's [http://www.corbinbleu.com/journal.html online journal], June 24, 2006, </ref> Filming took place from June-July 2006 in Toronto, Canada. 3.4 million viewers watched this movie in the UK coming first in its timeslot.

== Synopsis ==
Seventeen-year-old Izzy Daniels (boxer and the son of a golden-glove champion. His eight year old sister, Karin, is crazy about Double Dutch and Izzy is asked to take Karin and her friends to a Double Dutch competition, where Mary and her team are entering. Izzy has often seen them Double Dutch and is always bothering them, but during the competition he acts out of character,  standing and cheering along with everyone else.

Izzy finds he has a crush on his friend and neighbor Mary (Keke Palmer), a member of the jump team The Joy Jumpers, who place fourth in the tournament. They make the city finals, but when Yolanda, the fourth member of the team, decides to quit and join their rival team, The Dutch Dragons, they face the prospect of forfeiting the tournament. Izzy, after learning of Yolanda's departure, quips "Why, did she finally figure out Double Dutch is lame?" Mary then challenges Izzy to speed jump, and when he does it much better than they expect, they ask him to join the team, but he refuses because of what his friends might think. When the other members of the Joy Jumpers, Keisha and Shauna, ask him to fill in until they find a permanent replacement, he finally relents. His conditions are that they practice before school and in his dad's boxing gym, where no one's going to watch. Mary also has a crush on him.

Meanwhile, Izzy has a boxing match with Rodney Tyler, the school bully, determining who will win the "Golden Gloves", which goes to the best boxer. Izzy beats him, but Rodney doesn't accept it. He claims he just got lucky and pushes Izzy for a rematch. Izzy says no, and walks out of the gym.

Izzy improves tremendously at Double Dutch, and begins to love the sport. He tells the Joy Jumpers that he'd like to be on their team permanently, and they happily agree. Izzy and Mary starts to fall in love with each other and share a romantic moment and a kiss on their fire-escape. However, when Rodney finds Izzy jumping Double Dutch before class, he snaps some photos, prints them and hangs them all over the school. He then tells Izzy, "So that's why you won't give me a rematch! 'Cuz you're too busy jumping Double Dutch!" Izzy becomes mad and says he'll do the rematch. But in the middle of the fight, he tells Rodney that he's sick of being mad and that he's not going to let his anger control him. He walks out of the match and Rodney runs after him, intent on beating him up. But he trips on the cords surrounding the ring, giving Izzy a chance to get even. Instead, he just walks out. Mary tries to convince him not to quit their team but Izzy coldly ignores her and wants nothing more to do with her and the team. Mary is upset and heartbroken and she leaves.

The only girl boxer, Tammy, understands how Izzy feels. She gives him a pep talk on how she never quit boxing when the guys teased her, and that he shouldn't quit either, just because they made fun of him.

Meanwhile, Mary, Keisha and Shauna meet up for the city finals, but without Izzy, they feel like giving up. Izzy then walks in and asks, "What, were you really gonna start without me?" He apologizes and Mary smiles and hands him a uniform. They change their name to the Hot Chili Steppers and all is forgiven as the tournament begins. They get first in the compulsory, then second in speed. This ties them with the Dutch Dragons and the freestyle will determine it all. The Hot Chili Steppers get first, and go on to the State Championship.

After their performance, Izzy notices Rodney in the crowd, and asks him for a truce, which he accepts. Izzy had finally won the respect of his dad Kenneth (David Reivers) and Mary's love.

The narrator in the story was Rodney, and he was telling the story to kids, so the movie was depicted to be a story which Rodney was telling, he also states to one of the kids that Izzy is currently dating Mary. The film closes with Izzy teaching his dad to jump rope with the help of his little sister and Mary.

==Production==
The film was originally set to star Raven Symoné and be named ''Double Dutch'', but due to unknown reasons it was later revamped into ''Jump In!'' with Corbin Bleu.

''Jump In!'' is the 69th Disney Channel Original Movie and went into production in 2006.
Earlier titles for the film included "Jump", "Jump In" and "Jump Start", with some early trailers even showing the "Jump Start" title.

Karin Gist and Regina Hicks are credited as writers on "Jump In." They are also writer/Producer, writer/ Executive Producer respectively on the sitcom "Girlfriends."

Doreen Spicer, the original writer of "Jump In!", is credited as co-Developer and Supervising Producer of ''The Proud Family''.

Frank Fitzpatrick composed the original score for the film and wrote and produced 2 songs for the soundtrack, including the single "Jump to the Rhythm", a co-production with Nashville’s Keith Thomas featuring Jordan Pruitt. [http://imdb.com/title/tt0805559/soundtrack]

Promotion for the film began in the Summer of 2006, with a poster appearing in the program for the ''High School Musical'' Tour. Advertisements highlighted Corbin Bleu's association with ''High School Musical'' and ran heavily during re-airings of that film. Several videos from the film were also put into heavy rotation on Disney Channel, airing during breaks in regular programming.

Corbin Bleu became very good at jumping and even performed some of his own stunts like the donkey kick and pushups, but he did have a stunt double for some of the jumping like back flips and individual jumping.
At the end of the movie, Andy Royalle makes a guest appearance as one of the jump-ropers.
