'''Wah Yan College, Hong Kong''' (WYCHK ; demonym: ''Wahyanite'', pl.: ''Wahyanites'') is a grant-in-aid secondary school in Hong Kong. It was founded on December 16, 1919, by Tsui Yan Sau Peter (1889–1980). It is a Roman Catholic secondary school for boys run by the Society of Jesus, Chinese Province. Fully subsidized by the Government of Hong Kong, WYCHK is a grammar school using English as the medium of instruction. It has an enrolment of approximately 960 with 58 teachers and Irish Jesuit Fathers. The present principal of the college is Mr. Tam Siu Ping, George. 

In September 2007, the college officially endorsed the following Jesuit Vision Statement for their vision in education:  
“We offer a holistic, liberating and transforming Catholic education within a learning community for students and staff to become progressively competent, committed, compassionate, spiritual, and ethically discerning persons with a universal heart contributing to the welfare and happiness of all, in particular the poor and the neglected.”

==History==
===The beginnings===
The College was founded by Mr Tsui Yan Sau Peter on December 16 1919 on the 2nd floor of 60 Hollywood Road. On the first day of lessons, there were only 4 students. In the few years that followed, the College had also used 54A Peel Street and 33 Mosque Junction as campuses. As the number of students continues to arise, the College moved to a new campus at 2 Robinson Road (the present site of Bishop Lei Int'l House and Raimondi College) after Lunar New Year, 1921. On October 1 1922, the College was listed as a Grant-in-aid school. In 1924, a new branch school of the College, now known as Wah Yan College, Kowloon, was established. A hostel in Wah Yan opened in 1927. In the same year, the first Irish Jesuit father, Fr John Neary, came to Wah Yan as a teacher of Religious Knowledge.

In the early days of Wah Yan, the grades were not named as Forms 1-7, but Classes 1-8 instead. The "classes" were numbered in reverse order: Class 1 was equivalent to present day's Form 6 (the equivalent for Form 7 did not exist at that time), Class 6 was equivalent to present day's Form 1 and Class 8 was equivalent to present day's Primary 5.

===Wah Yan under the Irish Jesuits===
In 1932 the College was gradually transferred to the Society of Jesus, after a long series of negotiations between the original administration and the Jesuit fathers. The transfer was completed on December 31, and Fr Gallagher, S.J. replaced Mr Lim Hoi Lan as the headmaster. The school was also given a new name: College of Christ the King.

In 1933, the College published its first volume of its yearbook, ''The Star''. House system was introduced in 1934. In 1940 the hostel was closed down.

===Wartime Wah Yan===
Japanese troops invaded Hong Kong in December 1941. Classes were suspended as a result. Fr Gallagher and Fr McAsey were interned by the Japanese.

During the War, Wah Yan continued operations in Macau for a period of time.<ref>[http://www.wahyan.edu.hk/schstaff/history/wyhisrev1.html Wah Yan History Review 1]</ref>

There was another Wah Yan set up during the occupation (called "Wah Yan Chung Hok", meaning ''Wah Yan middle school'') which was closed down shortly before the War ended, due to the reason that the school "was the worst in the lack of teaching of the East Asia spirit".

===Post-war development===
After the Japanese troops surrendered, the College reopened on September 8 1945. Later in the year, Wah Yan Middle School was re-established as the Chinese stream of the College. In March 1946, the organization of the Wah Yan Dramatic Society, mainly consisted of alumni from the college and Wah Yan College, Kowloon, was commenced, and officially formed next year. Its first production was "The Thrice Promised Bride".

A night school was started by the College on February 17, 1948. In the next year, an afternoon school was also opened. In 1950 the Chinese stream of the College was closed down.

In 1951, the classes were renamed as forms: Class 1 into Form 6, Class 2 into Form 5, and so on. Class 7 and Class 8 were renamed as Primary 6 and 5 respectively.

In 1952 the afternoon school was also closed.

===Queens Road East "Mount Parish" era===
thumb|right|Robinson Road campus
In 1954, construction for a new campus at Mount Parish, Wan Chai started. On September 27 1955 the new campus was formally opened by Sir Alexander Grantham, then Governor of Hong Kong.

The school newspaper, "Starlet", was established in 1964. In 1971, Wah Yan College, Hong Kong helped to manage the then Pun U Primary School while the Pun U Association remaining the school sponsoring body.  The primary school was renamed Pun U Association Wah Yan Primary School, and was establishd as the feeder primary school of the College.<ref>[http://puwy.no-ip.info/overview/introduction.htm Pun U Association Wah Yan Primary School]</ref> The night school was closed in 1984.  The streaming to Arts and Science was started in Form 4 in 1986.

On April 12 1987, the Gordon Wu Hall to the north of the main building was opened.  In the same year Wah Yan got its first "10 A" in the HKCEE.

On May 8 1992, heavy rainfall caused a severe landslide to occur at the junction of Kennedy Road and Queens Road East.  It killed a driver passing by in his car.  The landslide caused the Laboratory Block to sink.  Cracks were all over the playground, and a worsening crack in the Classroom Block even had to be covered up with stainless steel plates.  In the same year Wah Yan got 3 "10 As" in the HKCEE.  Six classrooms (2H, 2K, 4H, 4K, 6S2, 7A) were demolished in 1993 due to the landslide.  They were rebuilt and were reopened in 1998. <ref>[http://www.wahyan.edu.hk/schstaff/history/timeline.php History of Wah Yan - Timeline]</ref>

In 2000, Wah Yan has got 2 10As, of which one of them, Jonathan Choi (蔡宗衡), went to Stanford University after Form 6, and the other, Caleb Yip (葉文健), went to University of Michigan.

The website of the school was first prepared by Dr Ashley Cheng in 1994. In 1997, the Parent-Teacher Association was established.  In 1998, all classrooms were installed with air-conditioners.

===School Development Project===
As the campus of the College starts to age, there had been plans to redevelop the school since 1995. However, the initial plans were aborted due to lack of funds and local law restrictions on architecture. In 2001 the Education and Manpower Bureau planned to upgrade all existing schools in Hong Kong to millennium standard, and the College successfully applied for part of the necessary funds for redevelopment. The School Development Project (SDP) was formally launched on January 26 2003, and works were officially started on May 25 2003 with the demolition of the old music room block.

The original aims of the School Development Project were to:
*Upgrade the school campus to millennium standards
*Provide extra classrooms required by the "through-train" education mode (this had been proved unnecessary since the school has decided not to adopt the "through-train" mode, mainly because of the declining academic standards of the students entering the College directly from Pun U Association Wah Yan Primary School)
*Construct a new assembly hall that can accommodate all students at the same time<ref>[http://www.wahyan.edu.hk/sdp/pics/book.pdf SDP Brochure]</ref>

The total cost is estimated to be HK$103.72M. It consists of 3 phases:
*Phase 1, which involves rebuilding the existing music room into a 6-storey multi-use complex. The cost was HK$38.9M.
*Phase 2, which is an extension of Phase 1. The cost was HK$4.82M.
*Phase 3, which involves rebuilding the hall. The cost is estimated to be HK$57M.

Funding for Phase 1 is by the Hong Kong Government's Quality Education Fund and the School Improvement Programme. Funding for Phases 2 and 3 are by fund-raising campaigns hosted by the school.

Phases 1 and 2 (New Annex) have already been completed and formally opened on January 31 2006 by Mr Donald Tsang, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. Phase III consists of a new school hall annex with a much larger hall that can accommodate all the students in the school. The annex will also house five extra classrooms and a lecture theatre. Phase III was originally estimated to be completed by December 2006; however the lack of funds had greatly delayed the completion time. Works for Phase III had not started yet and fund-raising is still in progress.<ref>[http://www2.wahyan.edu.hk/about/sdp/sdp.html Wah Yan College, Hong Kong School Development Project]</ref>

== Education Belief ==
According to the school's mission statement, Wah Yan aims at the development of each student in each of the following areas: moral, intellectual, physical, social, aesthetic and spiritual, in the basis of Catholic and Chinese tradition.<ref>http://www.wahyan.edu.hk/about/missions/missions.html School Mission at the home page of Wah Yan College, Hong Kong</ref> 

At Wah Yan, academic result is not seen to be the only purpose of teaching. Instead, Wah Yan emphasizes the commitment of individual student to the society. Besides ''In Hoc Signo Vinces'' and ''Ad majoriam Dei gloriam'', ''We are men for and with others'' is another motto of Wah Yan, which is sometimes regarded as the school's 'contemporary slogan' by the teachers and the students. 

Wah Yan also advocates the freedom in learning so that the students can have the opportunities to exploit their individual strengths, as well as to reveal the weaknesses. For this reason, Wah Yan organizes a more variety of extra curricular activities than other top secondary schools in Hong Kong.<ref>http://paper.wenweipo.com/2005/11/27/FC0511270005.htm  華仁仔 要高飛 (香港文匯報 27/11/2005)</ref>

==Wah Yan College, Hong Kong - St. Joseph College Rivalry Tradition==
There has been friendly rivalry since 1970's, both in academics and athletics between Wah Yan College, Hong Kong and St. Joseph's College, Hong Kong, two prestigious Catholic boy schools on the Hong Kong Island side of Hong Kong. Both schools have rich histories of academic excellence, as well as athletic competition and school pride.  The order of the names is by no means consistent; affiliates of either school will typically put their school's name first.  WYCHK typically places higher in Hong Kong secondary school rankings.  According to a recent Hong Kong Top 100 School rankings, WYCHK ranked at 5th and SJC ranked at 8th.

== Wah Yan Students Studying Overseas==
Many Wah Yan students are pursuing their further studies overseas, mainly after their Form Three, Form Five, Form Six or Form Seven at Wah Yan. The main destinations include America, Britain, Australia and Canada. The school authority are very keen on encouraging these attempts. For instance, Wah Yan College, Hong Kong has a specilised board with a couple of appointed teachers to write students' references and testimonials. The current Chairperson is Mr. H. P. Shiu, a Warwick-educated English teacher at Wah Yan.

Besides, Wah Yan has established the Post-secondary Education Trust Fund in which six scholarships and grant valued more than $300,000HKD p.a. are given to Wah Yan students for overseas undergraduate studies. Some of the sponsors are former scholarship winners.<ref>http://www.wahyan.edu.hk/downloads/scolarships/scholarships0809/undergraduate.html Wah Yan College Scholarship schemems </ref>

Some Wah Yan overseas students have been successfully admitted to the world's top-notched universities such as Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, MIT, Imperial College London and the London School of Economics. This has shown the tremendous academic ability of Wah Yan's students, as well as the usefullness of the school's support in overseas studies.

However according to the Principal of Wah Yan College, Hong Kong, Mr. Tam Siu Ping, because of the fact that many outstanding students are leaving the school for overseas studies after Form Five, Wah Yan's performace in the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination is not ideal.<ref>http://the-sun.on.cc/channels/news/20070630/20070630020838_0000.html 產五狀元...恆商贏到開巷 (太陽報網頁30/06/2007 )</ref>

==Wah Yan Tradition==
* The Wah Yan Spirit -- "Men for and with others" 
* Once a Wahyanite, forever a Wahyanite. 
* Wah Yan Dramatic Society and the "English Chinese Opera" performing heritage  
* The strong Wahyanites bonding (There are 16 Past Student Chapters over the world)<ref>Calgary, Edmonton, Ontario, Vancouver, U.S Eastern, Houston, Michigan, San Francisco Bay, Seattle, Southern California, United Kingdom, Bangkok, Melbourne, Singapore, Sydeny, Hong Kong</ref>
* Annual student exchange program with Wah Yan College, Kowloon and the school tie exchange tradition
* WYCHK's "Unofficial" sister school - Marymount Secondary School

==Campus==
The current campus at 281 Queens Road East, Wan Chai has an area of about 20,000 m² (220,000 square feet), located on a small hill known as Mount Parish. It was originally designed by the late Professor Gordon Brown, the founder of the Architecture Faculty of Hong Kong University.

Completed in 1955, the school has 7 main buildings:
*Classroom Block (partly reconstructed after a landslide in 1992)
*Laboratory Block
*Administration Wing
*Chapel
*Hall
*Gordon Wu Hall (completed in 1987)
*SIP Building, or New Annex (completed in 2005 as phases I and II of the School Development Project)
thumb|300px|right|Chapel (left) and Laboratory Block (right)
They contribute towards a total of 26 classrooms, 14 special rooms, a hall, a tuck shop, a chapel (previously 2, with one demolished prior to the school development project (SDP)), 3 playgrounds and 2 squash courts.

The Classroom Block, Laboratory Block and Administration Wing are linked together.

Since the campus' completion in 1955, it has undergone three major changes: the addition of Gordon Wu Hall in 1987, the reconstruction of six classrooms from 1992-98, and the School Development Project launched in 2003.

===Classroom Block===
The Classroom Block is a 3-storey building which was originally constructed using red bricks. However, replacements for red bricks became unavailable and gradually the red bricks were replaced with hand-painted bricks. The wooden window frames had also been gradually replaced with aluminium ones.

In 1992, a severe landslide caused a part of the block to be reconstructed, and was reconstructed with concrete. Brick wall patterns were painted on the walls to blend in with the original parts of the building.

The Classroom Block houses 24 classrooms (all classes except 7S1 and 7S2) and 4 toilets (3 male, plus 1 female for guests, although the school usually turns the male toliet downstairs to a female one when there are many guests).
