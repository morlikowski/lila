'''Jáchymov''' (; in German originally ''Thal'', later ''Sankt Joachimsthal'' or ''Joachimsthal'') is a Ore Mountains, close to the border to Germany.

The ''Joachimsthaler'' coins minted there in the 16th century became know as thaler for short, with Dollar and similar words for monetary units in many languages deriving from it.

==Mining and coinage==
At the beginning of the 16th century, Georgius Agricola) in the late 1520s, who based his pioneering metallurgical studies on his observations made here.

==History==
In 1523 the Saxon troops. When in 1621 the Counter-reformation and re-Catholicisation took effect in the town, many Protestant citizens and people from the mountains migrated to nearby Saxony.

In the 19th century the town was the location of a Regional Headquarters (''Bezirkshauptmannschaft'') and Court, and of an administrative office responsible for mines and iron production. Mining was still significant in this period. It was run partly by state-owned and partly by privately-owned firms. In addition to silver ore (of which in 1885 227 zentners [11.35 tonnes] were produced), nickel, bismuth and uranium ore were also extracted. There were also other industries: an enormous tobacco factory employed 1,000 women. In addition, there was the manufacture of gloves and corks and of bobbin lace.

On 31 March 1873 the town almost entirely burnt down.

At the beginning of the 20th century, First World War this was the only known source of uranium in the world.

The first spa in the world was founded in Joachimsthal in 1906, joining the famous spas of the region, like Karlsbad, Franzensbad, Marienbad.

==Modern town==
In 1929, Dr Löwy of Prague established that 'mysterious eminations' in the mine led to a form of cancer.  Ventilation and watering measures were introduced, miners were given higher pay and longer vacations, but death rates remained high.<ref name="whisky"> </ref>  

After the Communist party took control of Czechoslovakia in 1948, a large prison camp was established in the town now named Jáchymov. Opponents of the new regime were forced to mine uranium ore under very harsh conditions: the average life expectancy in Jáchymov at this period was 42 years.

'''Jáchymov''' (''Joachimsthal'' en monts Métallifères sur le Weseritz, la ville s'appelait à l'origine ''Thal'' (vallée) puis plus tard, ''Sankt Joachimsthal''.

Au début du , une mine d'argent fut découverte dans la région de Joachimsthal. L'exploitation de cette ressource permit à la région de se développer rapidement et le propriétaire des terres où se situait la mine, le comte von Schlick, devint un des hommes le plus riche de Bohême. Les Schlicks firent frapper des pièces de monnaie en argent nommées ''Joachimsthalers'', qui devinrent ensuite le thaler des les pays germanophones, puis tolar en Slovénie et dollar aux États-Unis.

Dans les environs se trouvent des mines d'prisonniers politiques du régime communiste.
