'''Clan Lockhart''' is a Lowland Scottish clan.

==History==
===Origins of the Clan===

The Clan Lockhart arrived in Scotland among the waves of Normans who arrived after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The Lockharts settled in Lanark and Ayrshire where the towns of Symington and Stevenson remain to mark the past influence of Simon and Steven Locard. The exact date when the lands of Lee came into the family is not known, but 1272 is traditionally accepted. 

===14th Century and the Crusades===

Symon (Second of Lee) won fame for himself and his family in the wars against the English when he fought alongside King Robert the Bruce and was knighted for his loyal service. Simon Lockhart the 2nd of Lee accompanied 'Good Sir James Douglas' of the Robert the Bruce on the crusades in 1330. It was Simon lockhart who carried the key to the casket in which the heart was carried. Simon rescued the casket and heart and returned it to Scotland after James Douglas had been killed in spain. It is said, the arms of a 'heart within a fetterlock', and the name in its present form came into use.

===The Lee Penny===

During the crusades of the 14th century the Lockharts brought back a precious heirloom which has been treasured ever since. It is known as the "Lee Penny". At the Battle of Teba in Spain, Sir Simon Lockhart captured a Moorish Emir and received from the man's mother as part of his ransom an amulet or stone with healing powers.  The Prince's mother told Sir Simon that the stone was a sovereign remedy against bleeding and fever, the bite of a mad dog, and sickness in horses and cattle. The stone is dark red in colour and triangular in shape and was later set in a silver coin which has now been identified as a four penny piece from the reign of King Edward IV. The Lee Penny is kept in a gold snuffbox which was a gift from Maria Theresa of Austria, Empress of Austria to her general Count James Lockhart in 1789. The fame of the Lee Penny spread through Scotland and Northern England and there are many recorded occasions when it was employed with apparent success.

===16th Century===

The 7th Laird was knighted by King James IV of Scotland and in 16th century the 8th Laird was involved in a case of forgery. His son, Alan, 9th Laird, was sentenced to the block for the slaughter of David and Ralph Weir, on separate occasions, and with this family they seem then to have been in constant feud. His sentence was revoked, and he received 'remission' in 1541.

===17th Century===

Sir George Lockhart (1630-1689)  was the second son of Sir James Lockhart, Lord Lee, Lord Justice Clerk and became one of the most famous advocates at the Edinburgh Bar. He became Lord President of the Court of Session in 1685 and was M.P. for Lanarkshire in both the English and Scottish Parliaments. His knighthood was conferred in 1663 and the Carnwath and Dryden estates acquired by him in 1681.  He was murdered on Easter Sunday on his way home from church by Chiesly of Kersewell and Dalry, a dissatisfied litigant.

George Lockhart, Second of Carnwath (1673-1732) was a fervent Jacobite, he became Principal Agent to the exiled King James after the Rising of 1715. He was one of the Commissioners for the Treaty of Union, and the only one against it. He was one of the earliest of the agricultural improvers. He married Euphemia Montgomery, daughter of the ninth Earl of Eglinton; they had fourteen children. He died as the result of a duel.

'''Локхарт''' — один из Шотландии.

Семейство прибыло в Шотландию в числе англо-норманов, которые прибыли на север в XII столетии. Они обосновались главным образом в графствах Ланарк и Эр, где до сих пор в названиях городов Симингтон и Стевенстон прослеживается история их основания Саймоном и Стивеном Локхарт. То, что семейство скоро приобрело выдающееся положение, показывает частота упоминания семейства в документах XII-XIII веков. 

Саймон, 2-ой лэрд Локхарт, сопровождал сэра Джеймса «Доброго» Дугласа, когда тот отправился с сердцем Брюса в крестовый поход в 1330 году, и он же хранил ключ от шкатулки с сердцем, которую спас и возвратил в Шотландию, когда сэр Джеймс погиб в Испании. После этого, как говорят, Локхарты получили свою фамилию в нынешней форме и герб – сердце в шкатулке. 7-ой лэрд Локхарт был посвящен в рыцари Яковом IV, а в XVI веке 8-ой лэрд был обвинен в фальшивомонетчистве. Его сын Алан, 9-ый лэрд Локхарт, был приговорен к тюрьме за убийство Дэвида и Ральфа Вейров, и позже Локхарты были с этим семейством в постоянной вражде. Однако, в 1541 году он был оправдан и освобожден.
