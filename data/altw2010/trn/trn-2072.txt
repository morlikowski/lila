'''''The Divine Comedy''''' is actress-model-designer the work of Dante Alighieri. 

The songs in this collection are for the most part acoustic, and are inspired by Jovovich's Slavic background, as well as from other philosophical roots based on various authors and poets that she liked to read from. She also credited Kate Bush as a musical influence.

It is an interesting album as most pop sound. Milla had to in fact, fight for her rights to have her own music released. While the album was not a commercial success, it was highly praised and well-received by critics. Many of the songs were written by 1970s Australian pop star Mark Holden - best known these days as one of the judges on the talent show Australian Idol.

Only one single was released from the album, "Gentleman Who Fell" which charted at #21 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=74726&model.vnuAlbumId=972468]
