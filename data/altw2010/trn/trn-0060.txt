'''Matthew James Everingham''' (1769–1817) was a transported to Scarborough'' as part of the Yarmouth, Norfolk, England in 1769. His parents were probably Earl William Robert Everingham (b.  ~1743 Yarmouth UK) and Lady Alice (b. ~1747 Yarmouth UK). Prior to his conviction he was employed as a servant by William Clermont, Esq, an attorney of the Middle Temple.

==Conviction==
On hulk for three years and then being transported to Australia with the Scarborough'', which left England on 13 May, 1787 and arrived at Port Jackson on 26 January, 1788.

==Exploration==
In 1795 Everingham became one of the first Europeans to set foot on Mount Wilson in the Blue Mountains, along with William Reid and John Ramsey. He wrote:

It is ironic and somewhat amusing, given the nature of Matthew’s crime, that in his letter to Samuel Shepherd giving an account of his attempt to cross the mountains, he wrote the following :

“If it would not be too much trouble, I should esteem it a most particular favour if you would send me few books for my instruction and amusement when I have an hour of relaxation from business. Here it is impossible to get them, or I would purchase them let them cost what they would”.

Matthew Everingham concludes his letter with a note that he intended to attempt the crossing again taking a more southward route where ‘it is a fine open country to what we travelled before and contains plenty of kangaroo, which will save our provisions greatly. I long to see the country on the other side of the mountains they appear such formidable barriers of nature’. Whether he satisfied this longing or not we will possibly never know.

Matthew, a Godly man, had written to Samuel Shepherd in England in 1796 that for “the many comforts we enjoy here, much more than we deserve and the melancholy account we had here of the affairs of Europe (if true) we have great reason to thank the almighty”.

'''Matthew Everingham''' (Norfolk, Royaume-Uni – 1817) était l'un des bagnards embarqués sur la ''First Fleet''. Arrêté le 7 juillet 1784 pour avoir volé deux livres à un homme de loi, il fut condamné à 7 ans de bagne - il avait alors 14 ou 15 ans. Il passa d'abord 3 ans sur un bateau-prison sur la Tamise à Londres, puis fut déporté vers l'Australie.

Au terme d'un voyage de 8 mois sur le ''Scarborough'' (départ le 13 mai 1787 du Royaume-Uni et arrivée à Port Jackson le 26 janvier 1788)dans de terribles conditions , Matthew Everingham, qui avait survécu, fut donc l'un des premiers bagnards qui peuplèrent l'Australie.

Survivant aux brutalités des gardiens, à la rudesse de la lande, et à la faim, Matthew purgea sa peine et fut libéré à l'âge de 21 ou 22 ans, redevenant ainsi un citoyen anglais libre. Mais il ne retourna pas en Angleterre. On lui donna un lopin de terre qu'il cultiva, et il épousa une ancienne bagnarde comme lui, Elizabeth (qui débarqua à Parramatta  le 13 mars 1791 du ''Neptune'' de la ''Second Fleet'').

C'est ainsi que les Everingham devinrent l'une des premières familles de la colonie. Ils eurent 9 enfants et à 47 ans, Mathhew devint policier.
