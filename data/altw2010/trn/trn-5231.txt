The '''Junkers Ju 87''' or '''Stuka''' (from '''''Stu'''rz'''ka'''mpfflugzeug'', "rear gunner) German ground-attack aircraft of World War II.  
Designed by Hermann Polmann, the Stuka first flew in 1935 and made its combat début in 1936 as part of the ''Luftwaffe's'' Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War.
The aircraft was easily recognizable by its inverted spatted undercarriage and its infamous ''Jericho-Trompete'' ("Jericho Trumpet") wailing siren<ref>However, the siren was only fitted to a few aircraft because of the extra drag induced on the already slow aircraft</ref>, becoming the air power and the Blitzkrieg victories of 1939-1942.
However the Ju 87 was vulnerable to modern fighter aircraft. Its poor manoeuvrability, speed and defensive armament caused the ''Stuka'' to require heavy protection from German fighters. The Ju 87's flaws became apparent as early as the Battle of Britain, when it was withdrawn from service after unacceptable and unsustainable losses.
The ''Stuka'' operated with further success after the Battle of Britain, and its potency as a precision ground attack aircraft became valuable to the German war effort in the African and Mediterranean Theatres and the early stages of the Eastern Front campaigns where Allied fighter resistance was disorganised and in short supply.
However, once the ''Luftwaffe'' had lost Air superiority on all fronts the Ju 87 once again became easy targets for enemy fighter aircraft. In spite of this, and lacking a successor, the type continued to be produced until 1944. By the end of the conflict the ''Stuka'' was largely replaced by ground attack versions of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, but some units, like ''Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 "Immelmann"'' operated the Ju 87 to the last day of the war.

The Stuka's design included several innovative features, including automatic pull-up blacked out from the high acceleration, and a wind-powered siren under its nose (later mounted to the front upper section of each fixed landing gear strut) that wailed during dives to frighten its victims. These were named ''Jericho-Trompeten'', or "Trumpets of Jericho", by Junkers and were a form of psychological warfare. Its rugged fixed undercarriage allowed it to land and take-off from improvised airstrips close to the battlefront, giving close support to German ground forces. 5,752 Ju 87 of all versions were built between 1936 and August 1944.

Although sturdy, accurate, and very effective, the Stuka suffered from a relatively low maximum speed and poor maneuverability, with little defensive armament, making it highly vulnerable to enemy fighters. The Germans learned during the Western Front, but it remained effective in the Mediterranean where Allied fighters were in short supply, most notably in the battles of Crete, Malta and Leros. 

Stukas were used in vast numbers on the Eastern Front, although the steady rise in Soviet airpower as the war progressed meant that Stuka squadrons suffered very heavy losses by the final stages of the war.

==Operational History==
===Condor Legion and the Spanish Civil War===

Among the many German aircraft designs that participated in the Spanish Civil War, a single Ju 87 A-0 was allocated serial number 29-1 and was assigned to the Vj/88, the experimental ''Staffel'' of the Legion's fighter wing. The aircraft was secretly loaded onto the Spanish ship ''Usaramo'' and departed Hamburg harbor on the night of 1 August 1936, arriving in Cadiz five days later.

The only known information pertaining to its combat career in Nationalist offensive against Bilbao in 1937. Presumably the aircraft was then secretly returned to Germany.<ref>Weal 1997, p. 15 - ''Junkers Ju 87 Stukageschwader 1937-41''</ref>

In January 1938 three Ju 87 A-1s arrived. Several problems became evident - the spatted undercarriage sank into muddy airfield surfaces, and the spats were temporarily removed. In addition, the maximum 500 kg (1100 lb) bomb load could only be carried if the gunner vacated his seat, and the bomb load was therefore restricted to 250 kg (550 lb). These aircraft supported the Nationalist forces and carried out anti-shipping missions until they returned to Germany in October 1938.

The A-1s were replaced by five Ju 87 B-1s. With the war coming to an end they found little to do and were used to support Republican positions. As the Ju 87 A-0 had been, the B-1s were returned discreetly to the ''Reich''.

The experience of the Spanish Civil War had been invaluable - air and ground crews perfected their skills, and equipment was evaluated under combat conditions. However, the Ju 87 had not been tested against numerous and well-coordinated fighter opposition, and this lesson was to be learned later at great cost to the Stuka crews.

===Poland===

On 1 September 1939 the Wehrmacht invaded Poland triggering World War Two.
At exactly 0426 hours a ''Kette'' of Ju 87s of 3./StG 1 led by ''Staffelkapitän'' ''Oberleutnant'' Bruno Dilly carried out the first bombing attack of the war. The aim was to destroy the Polish demolition charges wired to the bridges over the Vistula River.  However, the mission failed and the Poles destroyed the bridge before the Germans could reach it.

A Ju 87 achieved the first air victory during World War II on Rottenführer'' ''fighter piloted by Captain Mieczysław Medwecki, who was killed in the engagement.<ref>Weal 1997, p. 22 - ''Junkers Ju 87 Stukageschwader 1937-41''</ref>

The ''Luftwaffe'' had a few anti-shipping naval units such as 4.(St)/TrGr 186. This unit performed effectively, sinking the 1540-ton destroyer ORP Wicher and minelayer ORP Gryf of the Polish Navy.

On one occasion six Polish divisions trapped by encircling German forces were forced to surrender after a relentless four-day bombardment by StG 51, 76 and 77. Employed in this assault were the 50-kg fragmentation bombs which caused appalling casualties to the Polish ground troops. Demoralized, the Poles surrendered. The Stukas also participated in the Sturzkampfgeschwader'' alone dropped 388 tonnes of bombs during this battle.<ref>E.R Hooton 2007, p. 91</ref>

Once again, enemy air opposition was light, the ''Stukawaffe'' (Stuka force) losing just 31 aircraft during the campaign.<ref>Weal 1997, p. 34 - ''Junkers Ju 87 Stukageschwader 1937-41</ref>

===Norway===

Operation ''Weserübung'' began on 9 April 1940 with the invasions of Norway and Denmark, Denmark capitulated within the day whilst Norway continued to resist with British and French help.

The campaign was not the classic ski troops. The strategic nature of the operation made the ''Stuka'' essential. The Ju 87s were given the role of ground attack and anti-shipping missions. The ''Stuka'' was to prove the most effective weapon in the ''Luftwaffe'''s armoury carrying out the latter. 

On 9 April StG 1 caught and hit the 600-ton Norwegian torpedo boat ''Aeger'' in the engine room. The ''Aeger'' was run aground and scuttled.<ref name="autogenerated2">Weal 1997, p. 35.</ref>
The ''Stukageschwader'' were now equipped with the new Ju 87R, which differed from the Ju 87B by having increased internal fuel capacity and two 300l underwing drop tanks for more range.

The first ''Stukas'' took off at 10.59 hours from occupied airfields to destroy ''Blücher'' which caused disruption of the amphibious landings in Oslo through Oslofjord.

The ''Stukas'' however had numerous successes against Allied Naval vessels. HMS ''Bittern'' was sunk on French super-destroyer ''Bison'' was sunk along with HMS ''Afridi'' by ''Sturzkampfgeschwader 1'' on 3 May 1940.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

===France and the Low Countries===

The ''Stukawaffe'' had learned some lessons from the Polish and Norwegian campaigns. The failures of  Poland and the ''Stukas'' of I.StG 1 to silence the Oscarborg fort ensured even more attention was paid to pin-point bombing during the ''Phoney War'' period. This was to pay off in the Western campaign.

When ''Fall Gelb'' began on 10 May 1940 the Stuka helped swiftly neutralise the fortress of Eben Emael. The HQ of the Commander responsible for ordering the destruction of the bridges along the Albert Canal was stationed in the village of Lanaeken (14 km to the north). However the ''Stuka'' demonstrated its accuracy when the small building was destroyed after receiving four direct hits. As a result only one of the three bridges was destroyed allowing the German Army to rapidly advance.

The ''Sturzkampfgeschwader'' were also instrumental in achieving the breakthrough at Sedan. The ''Stukawaffe'' flew 300 sorties against French positions, with StG 77 alone flying 201 individual missions<ref>Weal 1997, p. 46 - ''Junkers Ju 87 Stukageschwader 1937-4</ref>.

The ''Luftwaffe'' also benefited from excellent ground-to-air communications throughout the campaign. Radio equipped forward liaison officers could call upon the Stukas and direct them to attack enemy positions along the axis of advance. In some cases the Stukas responded to requests in 10-20 minutes. ''Chief of Staff) said that "never again was such a smoothly functioning system for discussing and planning joint operations achieved"<ref>E.R Hooton 2007, p. 67</ref>.

During the Battle of Dunkirk 89 merchantmen (of 126,518 grt) were lost, and the Royal Navy lost 29 of its 40 destroyers (6 sunk, 23 damaged and out of service), mostly at the hands of the Ju 87s<ref>E.R Hooton 2007, p.74.</ref>. Enemy air power was ineffective and disorganised, and as a result the ''Stuka'' losses were mainly due to ground fire. Some 120 machines, one-third of the Stuka force, were destroyed or damaged to all causes<ref>Weal 1997, p. 55</ref>.

===Battle of Britain===

The Battle of Britain proved for the first time that the Junkers Ju 87 was vulnerable in hostile skies against well organised and determined fighter opposition.

Steady losses had occurred throughout their participation in the battle. On 18 August, a day known as the 'hardest day' as both sides suffered heavy losses, the Stuka was withdrawn after losing 16 of its number and numerous others damaged<ref>Weal 1997, p. 83 - ''Junkers Ju 87 Stukageschwader 1937-41</ref>. The myth of the ''Stuka'' was shattered.

===North Africa and the Mediterranean===

In response to the Italian defeats in Greece and North Africa the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ordered the deployment of some German forces to these theatres. Amongst the ''Luftwaffe'' contingent deployed was the ''Geschwaderstab'' StG 3 which touched down in Sicily in December 1940. In the next few days two ''Gruppen'' - some 80 ''Stukas'' were deployed under X. Fliegerkorps''.
The first task of the ''Korps'' was to attack British shipping passing between HMS ''Illustrious'' to heavy attack. The crews were confident that they could sink it given the flight deck spanned approximately 7,000 square metres.

On Malta.

Many ex-''Luftwaffe'' Ju 87s were handed over to their Italian ally, the ''Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940. The number was ineffective and the Italian forces were quickly pushed back. By early 1941 the Greeks had pushed into Italian occupied Albania. Once again Hitler decided to send military aid to his allies.

In March the pro-German Yugoslav government was toppled. A furious Hitler ordered the attack to be expanded to include Operation ''Marita'' commenced on 7 April. The ''Stuka'' once again spearheaded the air assault with a front line strength of 300 machines. Yugoslav resistance in the air was minimal. As a result the ''Stukas'' fearsome reputation returned. Operating unmolested the ''Stukas'' took a heavy toll of ground forces. The light losses incurred were a result of ground fire. The effectiveness of the dive-bombers helped bring about Yugoslav capitulation in just ten days.

The Stukas also took a peripheral part in Operation ''Punishment'' - Hitler's retribution bombing of Belgrade. The dive-bombers were to attack airfields and known anti-aircraft gun positions whilst the level bombers struck civilian targets. Belgrade was badly damaged, and a reported 15,000 people were killed or injured. 

In Greece, despite British aid, little air opposition was encountered. The ''Stukas'' were able to roam the skies and attack targets unmolested. As the Allies withdrew and resistance collapsed the Allies began evacuating to Crete. The ''Stukas'' proved effective in inflicting severe casualties to Allied shipping. On 22 April the 1,389 ton destroyers ''Psara'' and ''Ydra'' were sunk. In the next two days the Greek Naval base at Piraeus suffered the loss of 23 vessels to ''Stuka'' attack<ref>Weal 1998, p. 32 - Junkers Ju 87 Stukageschwader of North Africa and the Mediterranean</ref>.

As the HMS ''Juno'' was sunk, on the HMS ''Warspite'', and the cruiser HMS ''Gloucester'' were damaged . The Ju 87s also crippled HMS ''Fiji'' that morning, (she was later finished off by HMS ''Greyhound'' with a single hit. On HMS ''Kashmir'', HMS ''Kelly'' sunk followed by HMS ''Hereward'' on the HMS ''Orion'' and HMS ''Dido'' were also severely damaged<ref>Weal 1998, p. 38-39 - ''Junkers Ju 87 Stukageschwader of North Africa and the Mediterranean</ref>. 

The ''Sturzkampfgeschwader'' faithfully supported ''Operation ''Torch'' made the situation far worse. The ''Stuka'' became obsolete in what was now a fighter-bomber's war. The Bf 109 and Fw 190 could at least choose to fight on equal terms after dropping their ordnance whereas the ''Stuka'' enjoyed no such option. An example of the Junkers' vulnerability was demonstrated on 11 November 1942 when 15 Ju 87Ds were all shot down by USAF P-40Fs in minutes<ref>Weal 1998, p. 65 - ''Junkers Ju 87 Stukageschwader of North Africa and the Mediterranean</ref>. 

By 1943, the Allies enjoyed total air superiority in North Africa. The Ju 87s ventured out in ''Rotte'' strength only, often jettisoning their bombs at the first sight of enemy aircraft and making "a run for home".

The dive-bombers continued to support operations in Southern Europe; after the Italian surrender in September 1943, the Ju 87 helped Germany achieve the last campaign-sized victory over the Western Allies. The Greek Dodecanese Islands had been occupied by the British. The ''Luftwaffe'' reacted by committing 75 ''Stukas'' (of StG 3 with bases in Megara and Rhodos) to recover the Islands. With the RAF bases some 500 km away the Ju 87 helped the German landing forces achieve a rapid conquest of the Islands. 

After the Battle of Leros the I. Group of StG 3 was transferred to the Eastern Front (Dorpat). The remaining ''Stuka'' units continued to operate during the Italian campaign, but mainly at night to avoid Allied fighters.

===Eastern front===

On Operation ''Barbarossa'', the invasion of the Soviet Union. 
The ''Luftwaffe'' order of battle of 22 June 1941 contained four different ''Sturzkampfgeschwader''. ''Fliegerkorps VIII'' under the command of ''General der Flieger'' Wolfram von Richthofen was equipped with units ''Stab'', II., and III./StG 1. Also included were ''Stab'', I., II., and III. of ''Sturzkampfgeschwader 2'' ''Immelmann''. Attached to ''Fliegerkorps II'', under the Command of ''General der Flieger'' Bruno Loerzer, were ''Stab'', I., II., and III. of StG 77. ''Luftflotte 5'', under the command of ''Generaloberst'' Hans-Jürgen Stumpff, operating from Norway's Arctic Circle, were alloted IV. ''Gruppe'' (St)/LG 1<ref>Bergström 2007 (''Barbarossa'' title), p. 131</ref>.

The first Stuka loss on the Soviet-German front occurred early at 03.40-03.47 in the morning of the 22 June. While being escorted by Bf 109s from JG 51 to attack a fortress at Brest, ''Oberleutnant'' Karl Führing of ''StG 77'' was shot down by a I-153<ref>Bergström 2007 (''Barbarossa'' title), p. 18</ref>. The ''Sturzkampfgeschwader'' had suffered only two losses on the opening day of ''Barbarossa''. As a result of the ''Luftwaffe'''s attention, the Soviet Air Force in the Western Soviet Union was nearly destroyed. The official report claimed 1,489 Soviet aircraft destroyed. Göring ordered this checked. After picking their way through the wreckages across the front, ''Luftwaffe'' officers found that the tally exceeded 2,000<ref>Bergström 2007 (''Barbarossa'' title), p. 20</ref>. In the following two days the Soviets reported the loss of another 1,922 aircraft<ref>Bergström 2007 (''Barbarossa'' title), p. 23</ref>. Soviet aerial resistance, whilst it continued, ceased to be effective, and the ''Luftwaffe'' maintained air-superiority until the end of the year.

The Ju 87 took a huge toll on Soviet ground forces, helping to break up counter-attacks of Soviet armour, eliminating strong points, and disrupting the enemy supply lines. An example of the ''Stuka'''s effectiveness occurred on 5 July when StG 77 knocked out 18 Marat, during an air attack on Kronstadt harbor in the Leningrad area, with a hit to the bow with a 1,000 kg bomb<ref>Just 1986, p. 19</ref>.
Also during this action Leutnant Egbert Jaekel sank the destroyer ''Minsk'', while the destroyer ''Steregushchiy'' and submarine M-74 were also sunk. The Stukas also crippled the battleship ''Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya'' and the destroyers ''Silnyy'' and ''Grozyashchiy'' in exchange for two Ju 87s shot down<ref>Bergström 2007 (''Barbarossa'' title), p. 85</ref>.

Elsewhere on the Eastern front the Junkers assisted Army Group Centre in its drive toward Moscow. From 13-22 December 420 vehicles and 23 tanks were destroyed by StG 77, greatly improving the morale of the German infantry, who were by now on the defensive<ref>Bergström 2007 (''Barbarossa'' title), p. 112-113</ref>. StG 77 finished the campaign as the most effective ''Sturzkampfgeschwader''. It had destroyed 2,401 vehicles, 234 tanks, 92 artillery batteries and 21 trains for the loss of 25 Ju 87s to hostile action<ref>Bergström 2007 (''Barbarossa'' title), p. 115</ref>.

At the end of ''Barbarossa'', StG 1 had lost 60 ''Stukas'' in aerial combat and one on the ground. StG 2 lost 39 Ju 87s in the air and two on the ground, StG 77 lost 29 of their dive-bombers in the air and three on the ground (25 to enemy action). IV.(St)/LG1 operating from Norway lost 24 Ju 87s, all in aerial combat<ref>Bergström 2007 (''Barbarossa'' title), p. 119</ref>.

In early 1942 the Ju 87s were to give the Germany Army (''Heer'') yet more valuable support. On 29 December 1941 the Soviet 44th Army landed on the Kerch Peninsula. The ''Luftwaffe'' was only able to dispatch meager reinforcements of four ''Kampfgruppen'' (note: not ''Kampfgeschwader'') and two ''Sturzkampfgruppen'', belonging to StG 77. With air-superiority the Ju 87s operated with impunity. In the first ten days half the landing force was destroyed, while sea supply lines were cut off by the ''Stukas'' inflicting heavy losses on Soviet shipping. The Ju 87s effectiveness against Soviet armour was not yet potent. The later models of the T-34 could withstand ''Stuka'' attack, in general, unless a direct hit was scored. However the Soviet 44th Army had only obsolescent types with thin armour; this resulted in a rapid loss of virtually the entire armoured force<ref>Bergström 2007 (''Stalingrad'' title), p. 30</ref>.

Die '''Junkers Ju 87''' war ein von den deutschen Junkerswerken entwickelter einmotoriger Tiefdecker mit Knickflügeln, starrem Fahrgestell und zwei Mann Besatzung.
Seine Hauptaufgabe bestand in präzisen Bombenangriffen bei Tage im Rahmen taktischer Einsätze als Sturzkampfflugzeug ('''Stuka'''). Spätere Varianten der D-Serie wurden vornehmlich als Schlachtflugzeuge eingesetzt.

== Geschichte ==
=== Entwicklung ===
Typisch für diese Maschine, die vor allem durch ihren Einsatz als Sturzkampfflugzeug (Stuka) bekannt wurde, waren die ausgeprägten Knickflügel. 

Das erste Versuchsmuster hatte ein Doppelleitwerk, als Triebwerk kam  ein Rolls-Royce Kestrel zum Einsatz. Der Jungfernflug der Ju&nbsp;87&nbsp;V1 erfolgte am 17. September 1935. Am 24. Januar 1936 führte ein Abriss des Doppelleitwerks bei Sturzflugversuchen zum Absturz der Ju&nbsp;87&nbsp;V1 bei Kleutsch. Der Pilot Willy Neuenhofen und sein Versuchsingenieur Heinrich Kreft verunglückten tödlich.

Bei den weiteren Versuchsmustern und den Baureihen A-0, A-1 und A-2 wurden Triebwerke vom Typ Junkers Jumo 210 mit Leistungen von 600 bis 700 PS verwendet. Ein Teil der Baureihe A-2 und alle restlichen Ausführungen wurden von leistungsstärkeren Junkers Jumo 211 mit Leistungen von etwa 1000 bis später etwa 1500 PS angetrieben.

=== Einsatz ===

Die Ju 87 A wurde in geringer Zahl auch im Spanischen Bürgerkrieg in der Zweiten Weltkrieges wurden Ju 87 zunächst erfolgreich als Luftnahunterstützungsflugzeug für die vorrückenden Heerestruppen 1939 beim Polenfeldzug und dann 1940 beim Frankreichfelzug eingesetzt. Aus dieser Zeit rührt die Ju 87 als Symbol der Blitzkrieg-Taktik.

Bei der Luftwaffe gegen die Royal Air Force jedoch nicht gelang.

Die letzten schlachtentscheidenden Einsätze hatten die Ju 87 beim Kampf gegen die italienischen Truppen auf Kefalonia und Korfu im September 1943 und beim Einsatz gegen britische Land- und Seestreitkräfte im Oktober und November 1943 in der Ägäis, insbesondere bei der Schlacht um Leros vom 12. bis zum 16. November 1943.

An der Ostfront wurde die Ju 87 als Sturzkampfflugzeug und Schlachtflugzeug eingesetzt. Eine besondere Panzerjäger-Version war anstatt der Bomben mit zwei 37-mm-Kanonen bewaffnet. Dieser Panzerjäger, die Ju 87G, wurde zuerst von der von Hans-Ulrich Rudel geführten Einheit eingesetzt. Hans-Ulrich Rudel war der höchstdekorierte Soldat der Wehrmacht und zerstörte unter anderem 519 alliierte Panzer. Von den russischen Soldaten wurde die Ju 87 wegen des starren Fahrwerks als „Bastschuhträger“ bezeichnet.

Die Ju 87 wurde in den Versionen D-3 und D-5 von Rumänien ab 1943 sowohl gegen die Sowjetunion als später nach dem Ende des Bündnis mit Deutschland auch gegen deutsche Truppen eingesetzt.

Trotz aller Schwächen war die Junkers Ju 87 das erfolgreichste Sturzkampfflugzeug des 2.&nbsp;Weltkriegs. Besonders 1939 und 1940 war sie eine äußerst wirksame Waffe, die ihren Ruf nicht zuletzt der nationalsozialistischen Propaganda zu verdanken hatte. Ein bezeichnendes Beispiel hierfür war&nbsp;– abseits der Wochenschauen&nbsp;– der 1941 von der UFA produzierte Propagandafilm „Stukas“ (Regie: Karl Ritter).

==Produktion==
Die Ju 87 wurde von den Junkers-Flugzeugwerken in Dessau und der Weserflug in Bremen und Berlin-Tempelhof hergestellt. Bei Weserflug erfolgte ein Umbau von 40 Ju 87 D-3 zur G-2. 100 Flugzeuge wurden im Jahre 1944 bei Blohm & Voss zum Nachtschlachtflugzeug umgebaut.

Für den Export war die Ju 87 vor dem Krieg nicht freigegeben. Lediglich ein Flugzeug wurde 1937 nach Japan exportiert. Nach dem Kriegseintritt Italiens erhielt dieses Land 1940/41 insgesamt 97 Ju 87. An Ungarn wurden 1940 vier Flugzeuge zur Erprobung geliefert.
