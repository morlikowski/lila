'''Burglary''' (also called '''breaking and entering'''<ref></ref> and sometimes '''housebreaking'''<ref></ref>) is a crime the essence of which is entry into a building for the purposes of committing an offence. Usually that offence will be theft, but most jurisdictions specify others which fall within the ambit of burglary. Commission of burglary is normally referred to as to '''burgle''' (in British English) or '''burglarize''' (in American English).

#Breaking- this could be either actual, such as by forcing a door, or constructive, such as by fraud or threats<ref name = "Lawdict"/>
#Entering- this can encompass either physical entry by a person or the insertion of some implement with which to remove property, but not one solely used for gaining entry<ref name = "Lawdict"/> Although seldom expressed as a separate element the common law required that the entry be a consequence of the breaking. [Perkins On Criminal Law, 200; citing Regina v. Davis, 6 Cox. C.C. 369 (1854) Thus if a wrongdoer succeeded in partially opening a window by using a pry bar and then noticed an open door through which he entered the dwelling there is no burglary at common law. [Id.]
#House- this included a temporarily unoccupied dwelling but not a building only occasionally used as a habitation<ref name = "Lawdict"/>
#Night time- defined as being between half an hour after sunset and half an hour before sunrise<ref name = "Lawdict"/>
#Intent- most serious offences were classed as felony when this definition was prevalent, and included larceny, an alternative name for theft.<ref name = "Lawdict"/> This precludes licit break-ins whose intent cannot be for the commission of any crime, such as a forced entry to rescue a person from danger or to exercise a lawful arrest.

Occasionally this element is expressed as the intent to commit a felony “therein”. The use of the word “therein” adds nothing and certainly does not limit the scope of burglary to those wrongdoers who break and enter a dwelling intending to commit a felony on the premises. [Boyce & Perkins, 3rd Ed., 269, citing People v. Wright, 206 Cal.App.2d 184, 23 Cal.Rptr. 734 (1962)] It is sufficient if the evidence shows that the wrongdoer intended to commit a felony at the time he broke and entered regardless of the legal situs of the felony. [Id.]

The common law elements serve as a basic template, but individual jurisdictions occasionally alter them and they may vary slightly from state to state within federal jurisdictions.
This definition has been greatly expanded in most jurisdictions, so that the building need not be a dwelling or even a building in the conventional sense, physical breaking need not occur, the entry no longer need be at night, and the intent may be to commit any felony or theft.

==United States==
Burglary is prosecuted as a felony or misdemeanor,<ref>http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_long_will_a_misdemeanor_burglary_conviction_remain_on_your_record_in_Texas</ref> and involves trespassing and theft, entering a building or automobile, or remaining unlawfully with intent to commit theft or any crime, not necessarily a theft -- for example, vandalism. Even if nothing is stolen in a burglary, the act is a statutory offense. Burglary may be an element in crimes involving rape, arson, kidnapping, identity theft, or violation of civil rights; indeed the "plumbers" of the Watergate scandal were technically burglars. As with all legal definitions in the U.S., the foregoing description may not be applicable in every jurisdiction, since there are 50 separate state criminal codes, plus Federal and territorial codes in force.

The acts of burglary and any theft that occurs coincident with such entry are treated as separate offenses.  If the perpetrator's intended act after entering the burglarized premises was not a felony, the result can be two different misdemeanor charges rather than a felony count.  The theft itself might be charged as "(grand or petit) larceny from a building".  However, in Kentucky only unlawful presence and an intent to commit a crime are required.<ref>[http://www.lrc.state.ky.us/KRS/511-00/CHAPTER.HTM Kentucky law]</ref>

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts formally uses the term "breaking and entering" as well as "burglary".<ref>[http://law.onecle.com/massachusetts/266/16.html Massachusetts Law]</ref>
   
In criminal code of the State of New Hampshire, "A person is guilty of burglary if he enters a building or occupied structure, or separately secured or occupied section thereof, with purpose to commit a crime therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the actor is licensed or privileged to enter."<ref>[http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/LXII/635/635-1.htm  Section 635:1, NH Revised Statutes]</ref>

Under New York penal law, burglary is always a felony, even in third degree.<ref>Burglary in the third degree, N.Y. Penal Law section 140.20, found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS NY Laws].  Accessed May 28, 2008.</ref>  It is more serious if the perpetrator uses what appears to be a dangerous weapon, or if he or she enters a dwelling.<ref>Burglary in the second degree, N.Y. Penal Law section 140.25, found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS NY Laws].  Accessed May 28, 2008.</ref>  <ref>Burglary in the first degree, N.Y.

Many other U.S. states treat burglary as a more serious crime when it occurs at night; California formerly prosecuted night-time burglary as "burglary in the first degree" and daytime burglary as "burglary in the second degree", under most circumstances (this state now uses building type &mdash; residential vs. commercial/auto &mdash; in making the determination, with residential burglaries carrying the more serious charge). In states that continue to punish night-time burglary more severely than daytime burglary and the crime occurred during twilight, a standard of 30 minutes after sunset or before sunrise will often be observed as the boundary between night and day.

==England and Wales==
Burglary is defined by section 9 of the Theft Act 1968 which created two variants:
#
#

===Elements of the offence===
===="Enters"====
Although physical evidence of entry is not normally difficult to obtain, it can be difficult on occasions to decide whether an entry has occurred in law. In 1985 71 Cr App R 15 in which the defendant had been found on the pavement outside a shop with the top half of his body through the broken window, sorting though property on display for sale; this was held by the Court of Appeal to constitute an effective entry, while regarding the use of the word "substantial" as unnecessarily wide. It was ruled that the jury had been entitled to conclude that the entry had been effective. Furthermore, in R v Ryan 1996 160 JP 610, the defendant had been found partially within a building, having been trapped by a window, and argued that this was not a sufficient entry. However, he was convicted as it was held that a partial entry was sufficient and that it was irrelevant that he was due to circumstances incapable of stealing anything.

===="Building or part of a building"====
The Theft Act 1968 does not define a building, so this must be a matter of fact for the jury, however Section 9(3) specifically states that the term includes an "inhabited vehicle or vessel"; hence motor homes, caravans and houseboats are protected by the section even when temporarily unoccupied.<ref name="CJA91">{{cite web

Burglary can also be committed in "part of a building" and in R v Walkington 1979 1 WLR 1169 the defendant had entered a large shop during trading hours but went behind a counter and stole money from a till. The court held that he had entered that part of the building normally reserved for staff as a trespasser and was therefore guilty of burglary.
===="As a trespasser"====
The essence of 1976 3 All E R 54</ref> a defendant who had a general permission to enter his father's home became a trespasser when he did so in order to steal a television set, because doing so was inconsistent with the general permission. In recent years, the terms "distraction burglary", "artifice burglary" and "burglary by trick" have been used in crime prevention circles when access to premises is granted as a result of some deception on the occupier, usually by a pretence that the burglar represents some body who might reasonably request access such as a water, gas or electricity supplier.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=119357 Distraction burglary]</ref> <ref>[http://www.wiltshire.police.uk/campaigns/cmpview.asp?id=31 Police advice]</ref> There is no separate legal definition of this variant.

Als '''Einbruch''' bezeichnet man das unerlaubte Eindringen in einen abgegrenzten Bereich bei Überwindung eines Hindernisses. Was als Hindernis gilt, wird im jeweils geltenden Recht definiert.

Ein Einbruch geschieht meist mit dem Ziel, in den Besitz von Gegenständen oder Informationen zu gelangen. 

Einbrüche können durch das Anlegen von Hindernissen (Umzäunungen, Türen, Sicherheitstechnik) und eine Erhöhung der Sicherheit, zum Beispiel durch Einbruchmeldeanlagen oder eine Anwesenheitssimulation.
Unter einer ''Heißen Arbeit'' versteht man den Modus operandi bezüglich des angegangenen Objekts. Dabei wird Feuer (Aufschweißen) verwendet. Eine ''Kalte Arbeit'' ist hingegen die Anwendung von Werkzeugen (aufhebeln).

==Rechtslage==
Ein ''reiner'' Tatbestand „Einbruch“ kommt jedoch im deutschen Rechtsraum nicht vor. Einbruch ist immer an weitere Motive oder Tatbestände gekoppelt, wie Diebstahl, Hausfriedensbruch oder die Sachbeschädigung an Hindernissen bzw. der Versuch derselben.

Nach deutschen Strafrecht kommen die Tatbestände des [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/stgb/__243.html § 243] und   [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/stgb/__244.html § 244] (jeweils mit dem Grundtatbestand des [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/stgb/__242.html § 242]) in Betracht. Der Einbruchsdiebstahl ist die bei weitem häufigste Form.

So zählt beispielsweise Überklettern eines abgrenzenden Hindernisses im Sinne einer Mutprobe, Freude am Klettern oder um dahinter befindliche Gegenstände zurück zu holen, die sich im Eigentum der kletternden Person befinden, im deutschen Recht nicht zum Einbruch, sofern keine strafbaren Motive vorliegen und das Hindernis nicht beschädigt wird. An Hausfriedensbruch kann gedacht werden, wenn der „Einbrecher“ ohne Bereicherungsabsicht handelt, aber wissentlich oder erklärtermaßen unwillkommen ist.

== Wie, wo und wann wird eingebrochen? ==
Die Erfahrungen der Polizei und der Versicherer zeigen:
* In weit über der Hälfte aller Einbrüche werden Türen und Fenster mit einfachsten Mitteln aufgehebelt/überwunden (z. B. mit einem Schraubendreher).
* Rund 2/3 der Einbrüche finden tagsüber statt.
* Einbrüche finden vermehrt bei Anwesenheit der Bewohner statt.
* Über 1/3 aller Einbrüche scheitern an vorhandener Sicherungstechnik.
