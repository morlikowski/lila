==Synopsis==
Richie Adler lived with his mother and sister - his divorced father worked in the Middle East as a telecommunications consultant to several firms located there.  It was revealed in the episode "A Chip off the Old Block" that most of the computer equipment in Richie's room was sent to him by his father and in one episode "Airwave Anarchy", a programmable robot called Herman.   Richie collected these pieces of equipment from his father and connected them together to form "RALF" - his pet name for his computer system which included, in the pilot episode "Programmed for Murder", a camera which produced a primitive facial identification system when hooked into RALF's system.

The show was based on Richie and his friends coming across mysteries which they (mainly Richie) would attempt to solve using his computer skills with RALF's power. Guidance was provided by Farley (their mentor).

Initially, ''Whiz Kids'' aired Wednesday nights, but it began airing Saturday nights on January 7 1984, replacing ''Cutter to Houston''.
