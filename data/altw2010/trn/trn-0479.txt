Yo defini enjenieri kòm aplikasion de konnesans siantifik e teknik pou rezoud problèm kòmen.  Yon ekspansion definision sa dwe konsidere gran enpak politik e ekonomik sou desizion yon enjeniè kapab fè.  Se yon sians ki mande anpil imaginassions, vizializasion, yon bon fondation sou sians fizikal (fizik, estatik, dinamik, materièl karakteristik, etc.), matematik, bon jijman, avèk abilite pou kontiniman entegre nouvèl teknologi avan de prodwi yon objè oubien prosès nesesè pou fasilite aktivite imen. 

Pou mete l tou senp, travay yon enjeniè se « itilize benefis konesans siantifik pou rezoud problèm lòm ».  

Nan sosiete modèn (e.g. yon gran site), moun viv an gouf, e sou yon baz pèmanan.  Ki kreye yon sitiasion trè konplike.  Premieman, li mitige resous lokal yo.  Dezièm, anpil moun konsantre ansanm kiltive yon anvironnman kote salte kapab gonfle sou pil avèk pakèk.  Twazièm, yon gran vil itilize anpil enègi.  Nou kapab kontinie elabore sou pliziè lòt problèm toujou.

Pou rezoud problèm sa yo, yon enjeniè pa fokis senpleman sou analize ekzistan problèm sa yo, men kan li dekouvri yon problèm, li chache yon mwayen pou elege-l oubien elimine-l totalman.  Enjeniè-a fè rout ki nesesè-a pou bay kiltivatè yon fason pou rapidman vini jwenn konsomatè k'ap viv nan vil la ; fè l posib pou kiltivatè-a ka pote prodwi-l vin’ vann nan mache.  Li chache yon jan pou pote dlo bay tout moun nan vil la pa konstwi lign distribision nesesè e prè ase pou tout moun kapab trouve dlo.  Li chache yon fason pou itilize hydrocab, hydroelektik, pouvwa van ou solèy, pou delivre pouvwa elektrik nesesè pou soulaje aktivite yon vil.

Travay yon enjeniè pli konplike ke sa toujou.  Li konsiste plis ke chache yon mwayen pou rezoud problèm, avèk ofri posib solision.  Pafra, sa se senpleman kòmansman.  Wi, majorite plan projè enjenieri pran tan avèk yon ekip de patisipan pou reyisi.  Men pou ekzekite plan mande lajan, negosiasion politik, taxasion, e pliziè lòt kalite kolaborasion.   

Sipoze ou vle bati yon Sant Distribision de Dlo nan Pòtoprens.  Kòm yon enjeniè, ou kapab bezwen topografi lokasion ki konsène-a, estatistik sou kantite moun nan k’ap bezwen dlo.  Ou chita w fè tout kalkilasion ki nesesè pou etabli ki kalite tank ou bezwen, a ki elevasion-l sipoze ye, ki grosè fil distribision yo, ki pouvra ponp ki nesesè, si w menm bezwen ponp, etc.  Men, aprè w fini tou detay sa yo, desizion-an pa desizion pa-w ankò.  Ou sou pitie kliyan ki peye w pou fè travay la, si pou w jamè wè projè sa reyisi.  Avèk plis kliyan w’ap travay, plis konplikasion problèm sa yo ka poze.

An nou di se gouvènman ki te ba w travay sou problèm sa.  Menm anvan w kòmanse, gen problèm.  Nan yon peyi kote dlo pòtab raman asèsib, kiyès ki deside ki kote k’ resevra dlo avan.  Ki kote lajan ap soti : ou di tax.  Kiyès k’ap peye-l, e konbien lajan.

Tout problèm sa yo nesesite ke yon enjeniè pa senpleman gen yon bon baz siantifik, men yon abilite pou travay ak, konprand, e bien kominike avèk kliyan ki ba l’ fè travay yo.

'''Engineering''' is the scientific processes that realize a desired objective and meet specified criteria. The American Engineers&rsquo; Council for Professional Development (ECPD, the predecessor of ABET<ref name="ABET History">[http://www.abet.org/history.shtml ABET History]</ref>) has defined engineering as follows:
<blockquote>&ldquo;[T]he creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.&rdquo;<ref name="ECPD">[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1941Sci....94Q.456.

==History==

thumb|250px|The [[Watt steam engine, a major driver in the industrial revolution, underscores the importance of engineering in modern history. This model is on display at the main building of the ETSIIM in Madrid, Spain]] 
The ''concept'' of engineering has existed since ancient times as humans devised fundamental inventions such as the pulley, lever, and wheel.  Each of these inventions is consistent with the modern definition of engineering, exploiting basic mechanical principles to develop useful tools and objects.

The term ''engineering'' itself has a much more recent etymology, deriving from the word ''engineer'', which itself dates back to 1325,
when an ''engine’er'' (literally, one who operates an ''engine'') originally referred to “a constructor of military engines.”<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>  In this context, now obsolete, an “engine” referred to a military machine, ''i.&nbsp;e.'', a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a catapult).  The word “engine” itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin ''ingenium'' (c. 1250), meaning “innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.”<ref>Origin: 1250–1300; ME engin < AF, OF < L ingenium nature, innate quality, esp. mental power, hence a clever invention, equiv. to in- + -genium, equiv. to gen- begetting; Source: Random House Unabridged Dictionary, © Random House, Inc. 2006.</ref>

Later, as the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings matured as a technical discipline, the term U.&nbsp;S. Army Corps of Engineers).

===Ancient Era===

The Acropolis and the Roman pyramids in Mayan, Inca and Aztec Empires, the Great Wall of China, among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of the ancient civil and military engineers. 

The earliest civil engineer  known by name is Djosèr, he probably designed and supervised the construction of the Egypt around 2630-2611 BC. <ref name="Barry">Barry J. Kemp, ''Ancient Egypt'', Routledge 2005, p.159</ref> He may  also have been responsible for the first known use of columns in architecture.

===Middle Era===

British Charter Engineer Donald Routledge Hill once wrote: 

''"It is impossible to over emphasize the importance of al-Jazari's work in the history of engineering, it provides a wealth of instructions for the design, manufacture and assembly of machines."''

Even today some toys still use the cam-lever mechanism found in al-Jazari's combination lock and automaton. Besides over 50 ingenuis mechanical devices, al-Jazari also developed and made innovations to segmental gears, mechanical controls, escapement mechanisms, clocks, robotics, and protocols for designing and manufacturing methods.

===Renaissance Era===

The first electrical engineer is considered to be William Gilbert, with his 1600 publication of De Magnete, who was the originator of the term "electricity".<ref>Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary, 2000, CD-ROM, version 2.5.</ref>

The first steam engine was built in 1698 by mechanical engineer Thomas Savery. The development of this device gave rise to the industrial revolution in the coming decades, allowing for the beginnings of mass production.

With the rise of engineering as a profession in the eighteenth century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering the fields then known as the mechanic arts became incorporated into engineering.

===Modern Era===

Electrical Engineering can trace its origins in the experiments of Alessandro Volta in the 1800s, the experiments of Michael Faraday, Georg Ohm and others and the invention of the electric motor in 1872. The work of James Maxwell and Heinrich Hertz in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of Electronics. The later inventions of the vacuum tube and the transistor further accelerated the development of Electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other Engineering specialty.<ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/>

The inventions of Thomas Savery and the Scottish engineer Britain and abroad.<ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/> 

Even though in its modern form Mechanical engineering originated in Britain, its origins trace back to early antiquity where ingenuous machines were developed both in the civilian and military domains. The inventions of death ray, are examples of early mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions as well as the Antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or epicyclic gearing, two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the Industrial revolution and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as robotics and automotive engineering.<ref>{{cite journal

Chemical Engineering, like its counterpart Mechanical Engineering, developed in the nineteenth century during the Industrial Revolution.<ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/> Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants.<ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/> The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.<ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/>

Aeronautical Engineering deals with aircraft design while Aerospace Engineering is a more modern term that expands the reach envelope of the discipline by including spacecraft design.<ref name="Imperial"/> Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the turn of the century from the 19th century to the 20th although the work of Sir George Cayley has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.<ref name="americana">{{cite encyclopedia

Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining theoretical physics with experiments. 

The first PhD in engineering (technically, ''applied science and engineering'') awarded in the United States went to Willard Gibbs at Yale University in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.<ref></ref>

In 1990, with the rise of search engine was built by computer engineer Alan Emtage.

==Main Branches of Engineering==

Engineering, much like science, is a broad discipline which is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. These disciplines concern themselves with differing areas of engineering work. Although initially an engineer will be trained in a specific discipline, throughout an engineer's career the engineer may become multi-disciplined, having worked in several of the outlined areas. Historically the main Branches of Engineering are categorized as follows:<ref name="Imperial">[http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/engineering/teaching/studying Imperial College London England]: ''Studying engineering at Imperial: Engineering courses are offered in five main branches of engineering: aeronautical, chemical, civil, electrical and mechanical. There are also courses in computing science, software engineering, information systems engineering, materials science and engineering, mining engineering and petroleum engineering.''</ref><ref name="Edinburgh">[http://www.chemeng.ed.ac.uk/ U of Edinburgh] ''Welcome to Chemical Engineering, which is celebrating 50 years this academic year, is part of the School of Engineering and Electronics (SEE), which includes the other three main engineering disciplines of electrical and electronic engineering, civil engineering and mechanical engineering.''</ref>

*Aerospace Engineering - The design of aircraft, spacecraft and related topics.
*Chemical Engineering - The conversion of raw materials into usable commodities.
*Civil Engineering - The design and construction of public and private works, such as infrastructure, bridges and buildings. 
*Electrical Engineering - The design of electrical systems, such as transformers, as well as electronic goods.
*engines, powertrains, kinematic chains and vibration isolation equipment.

With the rapid advancement of Technology many new fields are gaining prominence and new branches are developing such as Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Nanotechnology, Molecular engineering, Mechatronics etc. These new specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches such as Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics and Electrical and Computer Engineering.

For each of these fields there exists considerable overlap, especially in the areas of the application of sciences to their disciplines such as physics, chemistry and mathematics.

==Methodology==
thumb|right|225px|Design of a [[turbine requires collaboration from engineers from many fields]]
Engineers apply the sciences of physics and mathematics to find suitable solutions to problems or to make improvements to the status quo. More than ever, Engineers are now required to have knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects, as a result, they keep on learning new material throughout their career. If multiple options exist, engineers weigh different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result. It is usually not enough to build a technically successful product; it must also meet further requirements. Constraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, safety, marketability, productibility, and serviceability. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive specifications for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated. 

===Problem solving===
Engineers use their knowledge of appropriate experience to find suitable solutions to a problem. Engineering is considered a branch of applied mathematics and science. Creating an appropriate low-level" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem. 

Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: destructive tests, nondestructive tests, and stress tests. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected. Engineers as professionals take seriously their responsibility to produce designs that will perform as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a factor of safety in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. However, the greater the safety factor, the less efficient the design may be.

===Computer use===
thumb|left|225px|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around the [[Space Shuttle during re-entry.]] 
As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business application software there are a number of computer aided applications (CAx) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using numerical methods.

One of the most widely used tools in the profession is CAE software such as finite element method analysis allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes. These allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of Product Data Management software.<ref>{{cite web

}} </ref>

There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as EDA for MRO applications for maintenance management; and AEC software for civil engineering.

In recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as Product Lifecycle Management (PLM).<ref>{{cite web

==Engineering in a social context==
Engineering is a subject that ranges from large collaborations to small individual projects.  Almost all engineering projects are beholden to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government. The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are pro bono engineering and open design engineering.

By its very nature engineering is bound up with society and human behavior. Every product or construction used by modern society will have been influenced by engineering design. Engineering design is a very powerful tool to make changes to environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a great responsibility, as represented by many of the Engineering Institutions codes of practice and oil. There is a growing trend amongst western engineering companies to enact serious Corporate and Social Responsibility policies, but many companies do not have these.

Engineering is a key driver of human development.<ref name="Human Dev">[http://www.ewb-uk.org/system/files?file=Hinton%20lecture%20text%20FINAL.pdf PDF on Human Development]</ref> Sub-Saharan Africa in particular has a very small engineering capacity which results in many African nations being unable to develop crucial infrastructure without outside aid. The attainment of many of the Millennium Development Goals requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.<ref name="MDG">[http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&faculty=14 MDG info pdf]</ref>   
All overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. A number of charitable organizations aim to use engineering directly for the good of mankind:

*Engineers Without Borders
*Engineers Against Poverty
*Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief
*Engineers for a Sustainable World

==Cultural presence==
Engineering is a well respected profession. For example, in Canada it ranks as one of the public's most trusted professions.<ref>, pg. 2, ''The occupations most-trusted by Canadians, according to a poll by Leger Marketing... Engineering 88 per cent of respondents...''</ref>

Sometimes engineering has been seen as a somewhat dry, uninteresting field in popular culture, and has also been thought to be the domain of nerds. For example, the cartoon character Dilbert is an engineer.  One difficulty in increasing public awareness of the profession is that average people, in the typical run of ordinary life, do not ever have any personal dealings with engineers, even though they benefit from their work every day.  By contrast, it is common to visit a doctor at least once a year, the chartered accountant at tax time, and, occasionally, even a lawyer.
