The author of a modern occult book called the Simon Necronomicon  claimed that the name Cthulhu used in the works of H. P. Lovecraft is based upon this name. It was argued that Cthulhu was actually ''Kuthalu'', which was reported as meaning "Man of Kutha" or "Man of the underworld" and thus a god of the dead, or more specifically Nergal. This was offered as part of many claims that Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos fiction was based upon Sumerian mythology. 

There is actually no evidence to support this claim, and Chris Siren, author of the Sumerian Mythology FAQ, states that "Lu" meaning "man" was only used as a prefix and not a suffix (so the name, had it actually existed, would have been ''Lukutha'' and not ''Kuthalu'') and specifically referred only to mortal men and not gods.

'''Kutha''' (Sumerian: '''Gudua''', modern '''Tell Ibrahim''' site, Iraq) was an ancient city of Sumer on the right bank of the eastern branch of the Upper Euphrates, north of Nippur. It was the cult city of Nergal, the god of the underworld[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.4.80.1&display=Crit&charenc=gcirc&lineid=t4801.p89#t4801.p89]

'''Kutha''' is also the name of the capital of the Sumerian underworld, Irkalla.
