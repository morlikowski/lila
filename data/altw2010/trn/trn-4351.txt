'''''Arrhinoceratops''''' (meaning "no nose-horn face", derived from the Ancient Greek '''"a-/α-"''' "no", '''rhino-/ρινο-''' "nose" '''"cerat-/κερατ-"''' "horn", '''"-ops/ωψ"''' "face") is a genus of ceratopsian dinosaur. The name was coined as its original describer concluded it had no nose-horn, however further analysis revealed this not to be the case.<ref name="ageofdinosaursarrhinoceratops" /> It lived during the  early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, predating its famous relative ''Triceratops'' by a few million years, although it was contemporary with ''Anchiceratops''.<ref name="ageofdinosaursarrhinoceratops" /> Its remains have been found in Canada.<ref name="ageofdinosaursarrhinoceratops" />

==Discoveries and species==
thumb|left|''Arrhinoceratops brachyops'' at [[Royal Ontario Museum.]]
Described by W. A. Parks in 1925, ''Arrhinoceratops'' is known from a partially crushed, slightly distorted skull which lacked a lower jaw.<ref name="ageofdinosaursarrhinoceratops" /> The remains were collected from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation deposits along the Red Deer River in Alberta by a 1923 expedition from the University of Toronto.<ref name="ageofdinosaursarrhinoceratops" />

Only one species is described, ''A. brachyops''. Other material from Utah, named by Gilmore in 1946, was originally known as ''A. utahensis'', thence transferred to ''Torosaurus''.

==Classification==
''Arrhinoceratops'' belonged to the '''Ceratopsinae''' (previously known as '''Chasmosaurinae''') within the '''Ceratopsia''' (the name is Ancient Greek for "horned face"), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period, which ended roughly 65 million years ago. It appears to be closely related to ''Torosaurus''.<ref name="ageofdinosaursarrhinoceratops">"Arrhinoceratops."

==Physical description==
Since this dinosaur is known only from its skull, scientists know little about its over-all anatomy. The skull features a broad neck frill with two oval shaped openings.<ref name="ageofdinosaursarrhinoceratops" /> Its brow horns were moderately long, but its nose horn was shorter and blunter than most Ceratopsians.<ref name="ageofdinosaursarrhinoceratops" /> Its body is assumed to be typical of the Ceratopsians, and based on the skull it is estimated to be  long when fully grown.<ref name="ageofdinosaursarrhinoceratops" />

==Diet==
''Arrhinoceratops'', like all Ceratopsians, was a herbivore. During the Cretaceous, flowering plants were "geographically limited on the landscape", and so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads and conifers. It would have used its sharp Ceratopsian beak to bite off the leaves or needles.
