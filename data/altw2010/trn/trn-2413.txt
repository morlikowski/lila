'''Valdemar den Store''' (Slesvig. I blodgilde i Roskilde". Det lykkedes Valdemar at undslippe, og efter at have samlet en hær slog han Svend på Grathe Hede og var nu enekonge.

Valdemar opbyggede en stærk kongemagt og rettede flere slag mod fæstning på en lille ø ud for handelspladsen Havn ved Lund. Absalon indsatte flere venner på ledende poster, og i 1180 udbrød der åbent oprør, og Absalon måtte flygte. Valdemar og Absalon vendte tilbage i 1181 med en hær og nedkæmpede oprøret.

Under Valdemars regeringstid skete der store forandringer i det danske samfund. Ledingspligten blev afløst af en sildemarkedet i Skåne.

'''Valdemar I of Denmark''' (14 January 1131 - 12 May 1182), also known as '''Valdemar the Great''', was King of Denmark from 1157 until 1182. Buried in Skt. Bendts Church, Ringsted.

He was the son of Canute Lavard, a chivalrous and popular Danish prince, who was the eldest son of Eric I of Denmark. His father was murdered days before his birth; his mother, Ingeborg, daughter of Mstislav I of Kiev, named him after her grandfather, Vladimir Monomakh of Kiev. {Vladimir's father in law was King Harold Godwinson of England. Vladimir 's grandfather was Constantine Monomachus, Byzantine Emperor}.

As an heir to the throne, and with his rivals quickly gaining power, he was raised in the court of Asser Rig of Fjenneslev, together with Asser's sons, Absalon and Esbern Snare, who would become his trusted friends and ministers.

When Valdemar was sixteen years old, King Erik III abdicated and a civil war erupted. The pretenders to the throne were: Sweyn III Grathe, son of Eric II Emune; Canute (Knud V Magnussen), son of Prince Magnus who was the son of King Niels; and Valdemar himself (he was holding Jutland, at least southern Jutland, as his possession). The civil war lasted the better part of ten years.

In 1157 King Sweyn hosted a great banquet for Canute, Absalon and Valdemar during which he planned to dispose of all his rivals.  King Canute was killed, but Absalon and Valdemar escaped. Valdemar returned to Jutland. Sweyn quickly launched an invasion, only to be defeated by Valdemar at Grathe Hede.  He was killed during flight, supposedly by a group of peasants who stumbled upon him as he was fleeing from the battlefield. 

Valdemar, having outlived all his rival pretenders, became the sole King of Denmark.

In Arkona, was taken, and the Wends became Christians and subject to Danish suzerainty. Danish influence reached into Pomerania.
