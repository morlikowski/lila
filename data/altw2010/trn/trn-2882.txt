The '''''Albany'' Class''' ''Baltimore'' and ''Oregon City'' class heavy cruisers of the United States Navy. All original superstructure and weapons were removed and replaced. The converted ships had new very high superstructures and relied heavily on Aluminum to save weight.

==Class description==
The conversion was extensive, stripping the ships down to their hulls, removing all armament and the ship's superstructure. , a Baltimore class cruiser, was converted at Boston Naval Shipyard starting in January 1959 and recommissioning as CG-10 on November 3 1962.  , an Oregon City class cruiser, was converted at San Francisco Naval Shipyard starting in July 1959 and was recommissioning as CG-11 on May 2 1964.  was originally slated to be CG-12, but  was converted instead. ''Columbus'' was converted at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard beginning in September 1959 and recommissioning as CG-12 on December 1 1962.  and  were also proposed for conversion to CG-13 and CG-14, but those plans were dropped because of the high cost of the conversion and capabilities of newer guided missile frigates.<ref name="Janes">Moore, John.
