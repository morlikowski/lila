==Biography==

At a 2006 Deicide gig in Laredo, Texas which was getting out of control, Ralph Santolla was arrested for allegedly throwing a Red Bull can at an officer after Deicide was forced to stop playing.<ref></ref> Santolla has always avidly proclaimed his innocence and stated that the allegations were wholesale created by the Laredo Police Department, which has been corroborated by many eyewitnesses on the scene. Charges were never filed and in fact the Webb County, Texas, District Attorney has confirmed and certified that the matter will not be prosecuted due to lack of evidence.

Santolla is a practicing against Christianity and are aware of frontman Glen Benton's open Satanism. Many were surprised that Benton even let Santolla join the band, due to his frequent criticism of the religion. However, Ralph stated that he is "not going to pretend to be some dark and evil person just so people think I'm metal" and also stated that he respects Benton, despite differences in their religion and beliefs, for not being afraid to be true to himself.<ref></ref> In a recent interview on Australian radio, Benton stated that he had no problems working with Santolla because of his religion, saying, "Ralph's what I like to call a part-timer... I mean, his favourite song on the new album is "Death to Jesus".

He has frequently talked about starting his own band with Steve DiGiorgio and Gene Hoglan, both of whom he had worked with in Death. He is currently working on a new solo instrumental album, titled ''Requiem for Hope''. This is his second solo album, his first was ''Shaolin Monks in the Temple of Metal''.  On May 24th, 2007, it was announced that Santolla had left Deicide. The reasons were are not totally known, but many believe that numerous death threats involving his religious beliefs, those which greatly contradicted that of Deicide frontman Glen Benton.<ref></ref> Recently though, Santolla has released statements citing that it is more of a business issue than a religious one, as he claims to want to "get as far away from Earache Records as possible when the new album is done". Steve Asheim has said in a recent interview that Ralph left because Deicide was not touring much.  

Also in 2007, Santolla was called in to fill the spot on Obituary's newest album Xecutioner's Return, replacing Allen West after Allan was incarcerated until 2008.  It is unknown if Santolla will stay with Obituary after West returns to the band.

Santolla is also a guitar instructor around Tampa. Some of his students have included Eric Hoffman (who Santolla eventually replaced in Deicide), Mike Davis.
