==Football career==
At the pinnacle of success, Weah moved to Europe in 1988 when he was signed by Monaco, who Weah credits as an important influence on his career.<ref></ref> At Monaco, Weah was a member of the team that won the French Cup in 1991. In the 1990s Weah subsequently played for AC Milan (1995 - 1999), with whom he won the Italian league in 1996 and 1999. In 1995 he was named Chelsea, Manchester City and Al Jazira FC, in the United Arab Emirates.

As successful as he was at club level, Weah was not able to bring over that success to the Liberian national team. He has done everything with the squad from playing to coaching to financing it, but failed to qualify for a single World Cup, falling just a point short in qualifying for the 2002 tournament. This has all led to Weah being known as one of the best footballers never to have played in a World Cup.

Weah was named world best for 1995, becoming the only African player to win the award. He was the fifth recipient of the award. The Silver trophy was won by Paolo Maldini, and the Bronze by Jürgen Klinsmann. The other four recipients were: Lothar Matthaus '91, Marco Van Basten '92, Roberto Baggio '93, and Romario in '94. Weah also won the silver trophy the following year which was won by Brazilian striker Ronaldo. Alan Shearer was awarded the Bronze.
