'''Bithynia''' was an ancient Thracian Bosporus and the Euxine (today Black Sea).

==Description==
Several major cities sat on the fertile shores of the Propontis (which is now known as Apamea.  Bithynia also contained Nicaea, most famous for being the birthplace of the Nicene Creed.

According to Sakarya river), but the more commonly received division extended it to the Parthenius, which separated it from Paphlagonia, thus comprising the district inhabited by the Mariandyni. On the west and southwest it was separated from Mysia by the river Rhyndacus; and on the south it adjoined Phrygia, Epictetus and Galatia.

It is occupied by mountains and forests, but has valleys and coastal districts of great fertility. The most important mountain range is the (so-called) "Mysian" Olympus (7600 ft., 2300 m), which towers above Bursa and is clearly visible as far away as Istanbul (70 miles, 113 km). Its summits are covered with snow for a great part of the year.

East of this the range extends for more than 100 miles (160 km), from the Sakarya to Turkish ''Ağaç Denizi'', or "The Ocean of Trees" - is not traversed by any mountain chain. The west coast is indented by two deep inlets, the northernmost, the Gulf of Mudanya or Cius) at the mouth of a valley, communicating with the lake of Iznik, on which was situated Nicaea.

The principal rivers are the Sakarya which traverses the province from south to north; the Rhyndacus, which separated it from Mysia; and the Billaeus (Filiyas), which rises in the Aladağ, about 50 miles  (80 km) from the sea, and after flowing by modern Bolu (ancient Bithynion-Claudiopolis) falls into the Euxine, close to the ruins of the ancient Tium, about 40 miles (64 km) northeast of Heraclea Pontica (the modern Karadeniz Ereğli), having a course of more than 100 miles (160 km). The Parthenius (modern Bartın), the eastern boundary of the province, is a much less considerable stream.

The valleys towards the Black Sea abound in fruit trees of all kinds, such as oranges, while the valley of the Sangarius and the plains near Bursa and Iznik (Nicaea) are fertile and well cultivated. Extensive plantations of mulberry trees supply the silk for which Bursa has long been celebrated, and which is manufactured there on a large scale.

==History==

According to ancient authors (Persia (546 BC), and were included in the satrapy of Phrygia, which comprised all the countries up to the Hellespont and Bosporus.
===Kingdom of Bithynia===
But even before the conquest by Alexander the Bithynians appear to have asserted their independence, and successfully maintained it under two native princes, Bas and Zipoites, the latter of whom assumed the title of king (''Nicomedes I, founded 278 - c.Prusias I, Prusias II and Nicomedes II (149 - kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself against Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic (74 BC).
===Roman province===
As a Roman province, the boundaries of Bithynia frequently varied, and it was commonly united for administrative purposes with the province of Pontus. This was the state of things in the time of Trajan, when Pliny the Younger was appointed governor of the combined provinces (103-105), a circumstance to which we are indebted for valuable information concerning the Roman provincial administration.
Under the Byzantine Empire Bithynia was again divided into two provinces, separated by the Sangarius, to the west of which the name of Bithynia was restricted.

Bithynia appears to have attracted so much attention because of its roads and its strategic position between the frontiers of the Danube in the north and the Euphrates in the southeast. Troops frequently wintered at Nicomedia.

The most important cities were Nicaea. The two had a long rivalry with one another over which city held the rank of capital. Both of these were founded after Alexander the Great; but at a much earlier period the Greeks had established on the coast the colonies of Cius (modern Gemlik); Chalcedon (modern Kadıköy), at the entrance of the Bosporus, nearly opposite Byzantium (modern Istanbul; and Heraclea Pontica (modern Karadeniz Ereğli), on the Euxine, about 120 miles (190 km) east of the Bosporus. All these rose to be flourishing places of trade, as did Prusa. Other places of importance at the present day are İzmit and Scutari (modern Üsküdar).

D'après Suétone qui le raconte dans son œuvre (''Vie de Jules César'', XLIX, 3), Jules César était surnommé par ses soldats « la reine de Bithynie » car il aurait eu une relation homosexuelle dans sa jeunesse avec le roi de Bithynie, Nicomède IV.
