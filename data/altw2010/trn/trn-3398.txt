'''Wehrmacht''' () oli natsi-Saksan armeijan nimi vuosina 1935–1946. Se perustettiin armeijan uudelleenorganisoinnissa vanhan Reichswehrin tilalle ja sen nykyinen vastine yhdistyneessä Saksassa on Bundeswehr.

Wehrmacht muodostui kolmesta haarasta:

*Heer - maavoimat
*Kriegsmarine - laivasto
*Luftwaffe - ilmavoimat

Armeijan ylipäällikkönä toimi koko Wehrmachtin olemassaolon ajan Adolf Hitler. Hitlerin apuna toimi sotilasesikunta Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW).

Wehrmachtin osuus toisen maailmansodan sotarikoksiin on kaksijakoinen. Toisaalta Wehrmachtin johtohenkilöstö koostui lähinnä vanhan saksalaisen sotilasperinteen konservatiivisista seuraajista, jotka eivät varsinaisesti olleet muutamia poikkeuksia lukuun ottamatta kansallissosialisteja. Toisaalta preussilaiseen sotilasperinteeseen kuului uskollisuus ylemmille, joka takasi lojaalisuuden hallintoa kohtaan sodan loppumetreille asti. Wehrmachtin joukot syyllistyivät Neuvostoliitossa julmuuksiin siviiliväestöä kohtaan ja muutamissa tapauksissa avittivat SS-joukkoja juutalaisten ja muiden ei-toivottavien kokoamisessa ja likvidoimisessa.

==Sotavuodet==

Voimakkaat panssari- ja ilmavoimat mahdollistivat uudenlaisen taktiikan käytön, salamasodan. Sodan alkuvaiheessa maa toisensa jälkeen valloitettiin ja miehitettiin viikkojen sisällä. Tämä vakuutti sotajohtajat uudesta ideasta, ''laaja-alaisesta aseistuksesta''. Joka tapauksessa vihollisvoimien aloittaessa sinnikkään vastarintansa salamasotataktiikoita ei kyetty enää käyttämään ja asevarustelun puutteellisesta tasosta tuli ongelma Wehrmachtille.

'''Wehrmacht'''  (literally "defense power/might" transliterated to "defense force" or more accurately "Armed Force(s)") was the name of the unified OKW, OKH, as well as Field Command. Thus, the Waffen-SS was, de facto, a fourth branch of the Wehrmacht. 

==Origin and use of the terms==
Before the rise of the NSDAP, the term Wehrmacht was used in a generic sense to describe armed forces of any nation, being utilized as the "home defense" version of the more general Streitmacht. For example, the term 'Britische Wehrmacht' would identify the British armed forces. Article 47 of the Weimar Constitution of 1919 declared "Der Reichspräsident hat den Oberbefehl über die gesamte Wehrmacht des Reiches" (meaning: "The Reichspräsident holds supreme command of all armed forces of the Reich"). To make a distinction, the term Reichswehr was commonly used to identify the German armed forces.

In 1935, the Reichswehr was renamed Wehrmacht. After World War II and under the Allied occupation of Germany, the Wehrmacht was abolished. When West Germany remilitarized in 1955, its newly-created armed forces became known as the Bundeswehr ("Federal Defence Force"). East Germany's armed forces, formally established in 1956, were known as the National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee). When East Germany (the German Democratic Republic) was incorporated into West Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany) in 1990, much of the Volksarmee  property and some of the staff were also incorporated into the Bundeswehr. 

Hence the term Wehrmacht customarily refers to Germany's armed forces during the NSDAP era and World War II, both in German and English. Note: It is incorrect to equate Wehrmacht with only the army (Wehrmacht Heer). For Service identification all Wehrmacht vehicles used by Heer, Luftwaffe or Kriegsmarine units had license plates with WH, WL or WM.

==History==
After armistice of 11 November 1918, the armed forces were dubbed ''Friedensheer'' (peace army) in January 1919. In March 1919, the national assembly passed a law founding a 420,000 strong preliminary army as ''Vorläufige Reichswehr''. The terms of the General conscription was abolished under another mandate of the Versailles treaty.

By 1922 Germany had begun covertly circumventing these conditions. A secret collaboration with the treaty of Rapallo. Major-General Otto Hasse traveled to Moscow in 1923 to further negotiate the terms. Germany helped the Soviet Union with industrialisation and Soviet officers were to be trained in Germany. German tank and air force specialists could exercise in the Soviet Union and German chemical weapons research and manufacture would be carried out there along with other projects. Around three hundred German pilots received training at Lipetsk, some tank training took place near Kazan and toxic gas was developed at Saratov for the German army.

After the death of President personal oath of loyalty to the ''Führer'', as  Adolf Hitler now was called. By 1935, Germany was openly flouting the military restrictions set forth in the Versailles Treaty, and conscription was reintroduced on 16 March 1935. While the size of the standing army was to remain at about the 100,000-man mark decreed by the treaty, a new group of conscripts equal to this size would receive training each year. The conscription law introduced the name ''Wehrmacht'', so not only can this be regarded as its founding date, but the organisation and authority of the Wehrmacht can be viewed as Nazi creations regardless of the political affiliations of its high command (who nevertheless all swore the same personal oath of loyalty to Hitler). The insignia was a simpler version of the Iron Cross (the straight-armed so-called ''Balkenkreuz'' or beamed cross) that had been used as an aircraft and tank marking in late World War I. The existence of the Wehrmacht was officially announced on October 15 1935.

== Numbers==
The total number of soldiers who served in the Wehrmacht during its existence from 1935 until 1945 is believed to approach 18.2 million. This figure was put forward by historian Rüdiger Overmans and represents the total number of people who ever served in the Wehrmacht, and ''not'' the force strength of the Wehrmacht at any point. About 2.3 million Wehrmacht soldiers were dead; 550,000 died from non-combat causes; 2.0 million missing in action and unaccounted for after the war; and 459,000 POW deaths, of whom 77,000 were in the custody of the U.S., UK, and France; POW dead includes 266,000 in the post war period after June 1945, primarily in Soviet captivity.

==Command structure==
Legally, the Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht was Adolf Hitler in his capacity as Germany's head of state, a position he gained after the death of President Paul von Hindenburg in August 1934. In the reshuffle in 1938, Hitler became the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and retained that position until his suicide on 30 April 1945. Administration and military authority initially lay with the war ministry under ''Generalfeldmarschall'' Werner von Blomberg. After von Blomberg resigned in the course of the Blomberg-Fritsch Affair (1938) the ministry was dissolved and the Armed Forces High Command (''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht'' or OKW) under ''Generalfeldmarschall'' Wilhelm Keitel was put in its place. It was headquartered in Wünsdorf near Zossen, and a field echelon (''Feldstaffel'') was stationed wherever the Führer's headquarters were situated at a given time.  Army work was also coordinated by the German General Staff, an institution that had been developing for more than a century and which had sought to institutionalize military excellence. 

The OKW coordinated all military activities but Keitel's sway over the three branches of service (army, air force, and navy) was rather limited. Each had its own High Command, known as Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH, army), Oberkommando der Marine (OKM, navy), and Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL, air force). Each of these high commands had its own general staff.  In practice the OKW had operational authority over the Western Front whereas the Eastern Front was under the operational authority of the OKH.

The OKW was also tasked with central economic planning and procurement, but the authority and influence of the OKW's war economy office (''Wehrwirtschaftsamt'') was challenged by the procurement offices (''Waffenämter'') of the single branches of service as well as by the Ministry for Armament and Munitions (''Reichsministerium für Bewaffnung und Munition''), into which it was merged after the ministry was taken over by Albert Speer in early 1942.

==War years==
===Army===

The German Army furthered concepts pioneered during the First World War, combining ground (Heer) and Air Force (Luftwaffe) assets into combined arms teams. Coupled with traditional war fighting methods such as encirclements and the "battle of annihilation", the German military managed many lightning quick victories in the first year of the Second World War, prompting foreign journalists to create a new word for what they witnessed: Blitzkrieg.  

The Heer entered the war with a minority of its formations motorized; infantry remained approximately 90% foot-borne throughout the war, and artillery primarily horse-drawn. The motorized formations received much attention in the world press in the opening years of the war, and were cited as the reason for the success of the German invasions of Poland (September 1939), Norway and Denmark (April 1940), Belgium, France and Netherlands (May 1940), Yugoslavia (April 1941) and the early campaigns in the Soviet Union (June 1941).

With the entry of the United States in December 1941, the Wehrmacht found itself engaged in campaigns against two major industrial powers. At this critical juncture, Hitler assumed personal control of the Wehrmacht high command, and his personal failings as a military commander arguably contributed to major defeats in early 1943, at Stalingrad and Tunis in North Africa.

The Germans' military strength was managed through mission-based tactics (rather than order-based tactics) and an almost proverbial discipline. In public opinion, the German Army was, and sometimes still is, seen as a high-tech army. However, such advanced equipment, while featured much in propaganda, was often only available in small numbers or late in the war, as overall supplies of raw materials and armaments ran low. For example, only forty percent of all units were motorised, baggage trains often relied on horse-drawn trailers and many soldiers went by foot or used bicycles (:de:Radfahrtruppen).  

Some historians, such as British author and ex-newspaper editor Max Hastings, consider that "...there's no doubt that man for man, the German army was the greatest fighting force of the second world war". Similar views were also explained in his book "Overlord: D-Day and the battle for Normandy", while in the book ''World War II : An Illustrated Miscellany'', Anthony Evans writes: 'The German soldier was very professional and well trained, aggressive in attack and stubborn in defence. He was always adaptable, particularly in the later years when shortages of equipment were being felt'.
 
Among the foreign volunteers who served in the Heer during Hilfswilliger.  Non-Russians from the Soviet Union formed the Ostlegionen. These units were all commanded by General Ernst August Köstring and represented about five percent of the forces under the OKH.

===Air Force===

The German Air Force, led by 1st Fallschirmjäger Division took part in the Battle of Monte Cassino. 
The Luftwaffe Field Divisions were eventually considered by historians to be a drain on manpower and resources that would have been better used in Army formations, and are used as an example of how poorly co-ordinated the three branches of the Wehrmacht were. This was partly due to the rivalry between the branches in general, but mainly due to Göring's ambitions. The Luftwaffe, being in charge of Germany's Anti-aircraft warfare, also used thousands of teenage Luftwaffenhelfer to support the Flak units.

===Navy===

The German Navy (Kriegsmarine) played a major role in the Second World War as control over the commerce routes in the Atlantic was crucial for Germany, Britain and later the Soviet Union. In the Enigma code. Large surface vessels were few in number due to construction limitations by international treaties prior to 1935. The "pocket battleships" Admiral Graf Spee and Admiral Scheer were important as commerce raiders only in the opening year of the war. No Graf Zeppelin which had been launched in 1938. Following the loss of the Bismarck in 1941, with Allied air superiority threatening the remaining battlecruisers in French Atlantic harbours, the ships were ordered to make the Tirpitz spent most of her career as Fleet in being. Since the appointment of Karl Doenitz as Grand Admiral of the Kriegsmarine, Germany stopped constructing battleships and cruisers in favour of U-boats.

===Theaters and campaigns===

The Wehrmacht directed combat operations during the Second World War (from 01-9-1939 to 5-08-1945) as the German Reich's Armed Forces umbrella command organisation. After 1941 the OKH became the ''de facto'' Eastern Theatre higher echelon command organisation for the Wehrmacht, excluding Waffen-SS except for operational and tactical combat purposes. The OKW conducted operations in the Western Theatre.

For a time the Axis Mediterranean Theatre and the joint campaign with the theatre.
* North African Campaign in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt between the U.K. and Commonwealth forces and the Axis forces.
*The Italian "Theatre" (1943-45) was in fact a continuation of the Axis defeat in North Africa, and was a Campaign for defence of Italy.

The operations by the Kriegsmarine in the North and Mid-Atlantic cam also be considered as separate Theatres considering the size of the area of operations and their remoteness from other Theatres.
