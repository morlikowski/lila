'''Tarot''' merupakan satu set kad berjumlah 78 keping yang selalunya digunakan untuk tujuan kerohanian ataupun ramalan nasib. 22 buah keping kad disebut sebagai Major Arcana (Rahsia Teragung) dan 56 kad disebut Minor Arcana (Rahsia Kecil). 

Ada sarjana yang mengatakan perkataan Tarut berasal dari perkataan Mesir Purba, ''Tarusy'', yang bererti jalan malaikat. Sesetengah pula berpendapat ia berasal dari bahasa Latin, ''Rotao'', yang bererti lingkungan bulat kerana ketas-kertas tersebut melambangkan lingkungan hidup manusia dari kelahiran ke dunia dan berakhir dengan kematian.

== Asal ==
Tarot pada asalnya adalah kertas-kertas catitan purba yang tidak diketahui asal sejarahnya atau generasi yang mula mengedarkannya, tetapi yang jelas kertas-kertas tersebut adalah sangat tua dan mungkin sezaman dengan kerajaan freemason berbangsa Perancis, Antoine Court de Gébelin dalam eseinya ''Le Monde primitif, analysé et comparé avec le monde moderne'' (Alam Purba, Kajian dan Perbandingan dengan Dunia Moden) pada tahun 1781. Di dalamnya satu bab mengenai Tarot, Antoine menulis kertas-kertas tersebut ditemui di Sepanyol pada tahun 1427 setelah kertas-kertas tersebut berada di dunia Arab selama empat abad sebelumnya. Semenjak penerbitan hasil kerja Antoine, beberapa teori asal Tarot dikemukakan, kebanyakan dari teori ini tidak dapat disahkan.

Kegunaan kad Tarot untuk meramal nasib dikatakan bermula di Bologna, Itali, dalam tahun 1700an. Kad Tarot juga adalah permainan popular di Eropah.

== Kad Tarot ==
'''Kad Tarot''' terdiri dari 78 keping yang terbahagi kepada dua kumpulan iaitu ''Major Arcana'' dan ''Minor Arcana''. 22 kad yang tergolong dalam ''Major Arcana'' disebut sebagai kad ''trump'', kerana kad-kad ini memiliki keunggulan dibandingkan dengan kad-kad ''Minor Arcana''.

The '''tarot''' (also known as '''tarocchi''', '''tarock''' or similar names) is a set of cards typically featuring twenty one trump cards, the fool, and an extra face card per suit, in addition to the usual suit (face and pip) cards found in ordinary playing cards. Tarot cards are used throughout much of Europe to play Tarot card games.<ref name="DummettGame">

==History==
Playing cards first entered Italian and Spanish decks<ref>David Vernon, Milan, Ferrara, or Bologna, in northern Italy, when additional trump cards with allegorical illustrations were added to the more common four suit decks that already existed. These new decks were originally called ''carte da trionfi'', triumph cards. The first literary evidence of the existence of ''carte da trionfi'' is a written statement in the court records in Ferrara, in 1442. The oldest surviving Tarot cards are from fifteen fragmented decks painted in the mid 15th century for the Visconti-Sforza family, the rulers of Milan<ref>Place, Robert M. (2005) ''The Tarot: History,Symbolism,and Divination,'', Tarcher/Penguin, New York, ISBN 1-58542-349-1</ref>. 

No documented examples exist prior to the 18th century of the tarot being used for divination. However, divination using similar cards is in evidence as early as 1540; a book entitled ''The Oracles of Francesco Marcolino da Forli'' shows a simple method of divination using the coin suit of a regular playing card deck. Manuscripts from 1735 (''The Square of Sevens'') and 1750 (''Pratesi Cartomancer'') document rudimentary divinatory meanings for the cards of the tarot, as well as a system for laying out the cards. In 1765, Giacomo Casanova wrote in his diary that his Russian mistress frequently used a deck of playing cards for divination. 

===Early decks===
Playing cards first appeared in playing card history for discussion of its origins). Early European sources describe a deck with typically fifty two cards, like a modern deck with no jokers. The seventy eight card tarot resulted from adding the twenty two trump cards to an early fifty six card variant (fourteen cards per suit).

Wide use of playing cards in Europe can, with some certainty, be given from 1377 onwards. Tarot cards appear to have been developed some forty years later, and they are mentioned in the surviving text of Martiano da Tortona. Da Tortona's text is thought to have been written between 1418 and 1425, since in 1418 the painter Michelino da Besozzo returned to Milan, and Martiano da Tortona died in 1425. 

Da Tortona describes a deck similar to the cards used for Tarot card games in many specific ways though what he describes is more a precursor to tarot than what we might think of as real tarot cards. For instance, his deck has only sixteen trump cards, with motifs that are not comparable to common tarot cards (they are Greek gods) and the suits are four kinds of birds, not the common Italian suits. What makes da Tortona's deck similar to modern tarot game cards is that these sixteen cards are obviously regarded as trump cards in a card game; about twenty five years later, a near contemporary of Da Tortona, Jacopo Antonio Marcello, called them a ''ludus triumphorum'', or 'game winner'.

The next documents that seem to confirm the existence of objects similar to tarot cards are two playing card decks from Milan (Brera-Brambrilla and Cary-Yale-Tarocchi) &mdash; extant, but fragmentary &mdash; and three documents, all from the court of Jubilee year in Italy, which saw many festivities and the movement of many pilgrims.

It seems apparent that the special motifs on the trump cards, which were added to regular playing cards with a 'four suits of fourteen cards' structure, were ideologically determined. They are thought to show a specific system of transporting messages of different content; known early examples show Roman/Greek/Babylonian heroes, as in the case of the Sola-Busca-Tarocchi (1491) and the Boiardo Tarocchi poem (produced at an unknown date between 1461 and 1494). For example, the earliest-known deck, extant only in its description in Martiano's short book, was produced to show the system of Greek gods, a theme that was very fashionable in Italy at the time. Its production may well have accompanied a triumphal celebration of the commissioner Filippo Maria Visconti, duke of Milano, meaning that the purpose of the deck was to express and consolidate the political power in Milan (as was common for other artworks of the time). The four suits showed birds, motifs that appeared regularly in Visconti heraldry, and the specific order of the gods gives reason to assume that the deck was intended to imply that the Visconti identified themselves as descendants from Jupiter and Venus (which were seen not as gods but deified mortal heroes).

This first known deck seems to have had the standard ten numbered cards, but having kings as the only court card, and only sixteen trump cards. The later standard (four suits of fourteen plus twenty two) took time to settle; ''trionfi'' decks with seventy cards only are still spoken of in 1457. No corroborating evidence for the final standard  seventy eight card format exists prior to the Boiardo Tarocchi poem and the Sola Busca Tarocchi.

The oldest surviving tarot cards are three early to mid 15th century sets, all made for members of the Visconti family. The first deck is the so called Cary-Yale Tarot (or Visconti-Modrone Tarot), which was created between 1442 and 1447 by an anonymous painter for Filippo Maria Visconti. The cards (only sixty six) are today in the Yale University Library of New Haven. But the most famous of these early tarot decks was painted in the mid 15th century, to celebrate the rule of Milan by Francesco Sforza and his wife Bianca Maria Visconti, daughter of the duke Filippo Maria. Probably, these cards were painted by "Visconti-Sforza" deck, which has been widely reproduced, combines the suits of swords, batons, coins and cups and the court cards king, queen, knight and page with trump cards that reflect conventional iconography of the time to a significant degree.<ref name="BertiVisconti">

For a long time tarot cards remained a privilege for the upper classes, and, although some sermons inveighing against the evil inherent in cards can be traced to the 14th century, most civil governments did not routinely condemn tarot cards during tarot's early history. In fact, in some jurisdictions, tarot cards were specifically exempted from laws otherwise prohibiting the playing of cards.

===Later tarot decks===
As the earliest tarot cards were hand painted, the number of the decks produced is thought to have been rather small, and it was only after the invention of the printing press that mass production of cards became possible. Decks survive from this era from various cities in France (the best known being a deck from the southern city of Marseilles). At around the same time, the name ''tarocchi'' appeared.

In 1781 India.<ref name="SpiritualTarot"> </ref> The reason the origin of the tarot cards was supposed to be descendants of ancient Egypt (hence the name "Gypsy").

The first wide publicity of divination by tarot came from a French occultist named Alliette, under the pseudonym "Etteilla" (his name reversed), who worked as a seer and card diviner shortly before the French Revolution. Etteilla designed the first astrological attributions and "Egyptian" motifs to various cards, altering many of them from the Marseilles designs, and adding divinatory meanings in text on the cards. Later, Mademoiselle Napoleon I, through the influence she wielded over Joséphine de Beauharnais, Napoleon's first wife. However, she did not typically use Tarot.

Tarot cards eventually came to be associated with magic.<ref>Huson, Paul ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage''. Vermont: Destiny Books, 2004</ref> Tarot was not widely adopted by mystics, occultists and secret societies until the 18th and 19th centuries. The tradition began in 1781, when Antoine Court de Gébelin, a Swiss Freemason, published ''Le Monde Primitif'', a speculative study which included religious mysteries of Egyptian words ''tar'', meaning "royal", and ''ro'', meaning "road", and that the Tarot therefore represented a "royal road" to wisdom. Gébelin wrote before Champollion had deciphered Egyptologists found nothing in the Egyptian language to support de Gébelin's fanciful etymologies. Despite this the identification of the Tarot cards with the Egyptian "Book of Thoth" was already firmly established in occult practice.

The idea of the cards as a mystical key was further developed by Eliphas Lévi and passed to the English-speaking world by The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Lévi, not Etteilla, is considered by some to be the true founder of most contemporary schools of Tarot; his 1854 ''Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie'' (English title: ''Transcendental Magic'') introduced an interpretation of the cards which related them to Hermetic Qabalah. While Lévi accepted Court de Gébelin's claims about an Egyptian origin of the deck symbols, he rejected Etteilla's innovations and his altered deck, and devised instead a system which related the Tarot, especially the Tarot de Marseille, to the Kabbalah and the four elements of alchemy.

Tarot divination became increasingly popular from 1910, with the publication of the Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot (designed and executed by two members of the Golden Dawn), which replaced the traditionally simple pip cards with images of symbolic scenes. This deck also further obscured the Christian allegories of early decks by changing some attributions (for instance changing "The Pope" to "The Hierophant" and "The Popess" to "The High Priestess"). The Rider-Waite-Smith deck still remains extremely popular in the English-speaking world.

Since then a huge number of different decks have been created, some traditional, some vastly different. The use of Tarot for fairies, goddesses, Power Animals, etc. Although obviously influenced by Tarot, they do not follow the traditional structure of Tarot; they lack any suits of numbered cards, and the set of cards differs from the traditional major arcana.

==Tarot card games==
One usage of tarot cards is for playing games, with the first basic rules appearing in the manuscript of Martiano da Tortona before 1425.<ref>[http://trionfi.com/0/b/11/t1.php Description of the Michelino deck - translated text]</ref>
The game is nowadays known in many variations, first basic rules appear in the manuscript of Martiano da Tortona (before 1425; [http://trionfi.com/0/b/11/ translated text]), the next are known from the year 1637. In Italy the game has become less popular, one version named [http://pagat.com/tarot/ottocen.html Tarocco Bolognese: Ottocento] has still survived and there are still others played in Piedmont, but the number of games outside of Italy is much higher, there connected to the words ''Tarot'' and ''Tarock''.      

It is played with a tarot deck of playing cards.  The so-called "esoteric" decks used for divination are usually ill-suited for playing, for example the corner symbols are missing; thus there are regular playing decks in the countries where tarocchi is popular.

The 78-card deck contains: 
*four suits: depending on the region, either the Anglo-French hearts, diamonds, spades and clubs or the original Latin suits of swords, batons, cups, and coins; numbered one through ten, plus four court cards - a jack, a knight, a queen, and a king;
*the twenty-one tarots, known in divination as the trumps;
*the Fool, also known as the Excuse, an un-numbered card that in some variations excuses the player from following suit or playing a trump, and in others acts as the strongest trump.

===Typical rules of play===
thumb|right|Modern tarot deck used for [[French tarot card game]]
thumb|right|Tarocco Piemontese:the Fool. Italian suited Tarots are still used in [[Tarocchini|Italy and Switzerland for card games]]
Play is typically counter-clockwise; the player to the right of the dealer plays to the first trick. If possible players must follow suit. If following suit is not possible a trump card must be played. The winner of each trick leads the next.

====Common value of cards====
* Oudlers/Trull (Trumps 1, 21 and the Fool) : 5 points
* Kings : 5 points
* Queens : 4 points
* Cavaliers : 3 points
* Jacks : 2 points
* all other cards : fraction of a point
The cards are usually counted in groups of 2 or 3 depending on the game.
After the hand has been played, a score is taken based on the point values of the cards in the tricks each player has managed to capture. 
([http://pagat.com/tarot/counting.html counting cards])

For the purpose of the rules, the numbering of the trumps are the only thing that matters. The symbolic tarot images customary in divinatory tarot have no effect in the game itself: though, rather ironically, the tarot deck was originally designed to play this game (see playing card history), the design traditions subsequently evolved independently and the tarots often bear only numbers and whimsical scenes arbitrarily chosen by the engraver. However there are still traditional sequences of images in which the common lineage is visible: for example, a moon is visible at the bottom left corner of the XXI in the picture at the top of the page. This stems from confusion of German ''Mond'' with Italian ''mondo'' and French ''monde'', meaning "world" - the usual symbol associated with the 21 on Italian suited tarots and in divinatory tarot.

In tarot decks made for playing the game (as opposed to those made for French suits of hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Some variations of the game are played with a 54-card deck (5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of hearts and diamonds and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of spades and clubs are discarded).

Variations of the game are still played in Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, for which even the name ''Tarockanien'' has been coined: the Austrian variation of the game is thus still widely popular among all classes and generations in Slovenia, Croatia and in the Czech Republic, while in Hungary different rules are applied.

==Occult tarot and divination==
Tarot reading revolves around the belief that the cards can be used to gain insight into the current and possible future situations of the subject (or Gaia, while others believe the cards help them tap into a collective unconscious or their own creative, brainstorming subconscious.

===Common card interpretations===
Each card has a variety of symbolic meanings that have evolved over the years.  Custom or themed tarot decks exist which have even more specific symbolism, although these are more prevalent in the English-speaking world. The minor arcana cards have astrological attributions that can be used as general indicators of timing in the year, based on the Octavian calendar, and the court cards may signify different people in a tarot reading, with each suit's "nature" providing hints about that person's physical and emotional characteristics.

Tarot has a complex and rich symbolism with a long history.  In the past, many occult- or divination-oriented authors claimed that the symbolism's origins are lost in time and/or postulated or claimed as fact non-historical theories.  Some authors such as Rachel Pollack have written that tarot origin myths have their own significance and value and that the reader can find a study of such myths enriching while at the same time being aware that they aren't factually true.  
 
Interpretations have evolved together with the cards over the centuries: later decks have "clarified" the pictures in accordance with meanings assigned to the cards by their creators.  In turn, the meanings come to be modified by the new pictures. Images and interpretations have been continually reshaped, in part, to help the Tarot live up to its mythic role as a powerful occult instrument and to respond to modern needs.

See, for example, the Rider-Waite-Smith Strength card. We can know more about the symbolic intentions of the designer here, since he conveniently wrote many books on the subject on occultism and symbolism and a handbook specifically for this deck titled ''The Pictorial Key to the Tarot'' (1910). As with its ancestor in the Tarot de Marseilles, the Strength trump shows a woman holding the jaws of a lion, but the Rider-Waite-Smith picture is far more elaborate. The woman's hat of the Marseilles card has been interpreted as a lemniscate: the sideways-figure-eight representing infinity, or, according to Waite, the Spirit of  Life.  Other symbols are included: a chain of roses symbolizing desire or passion, against a white robe symbolizing purity. The mountains in the background demonstrate another kind of strength. 

Another example of the preservation of designs from one deck to another can be seen via the incorporation of the ribbon design found on the Deux de Deniéres in a Swiss-style deck originally published by Müller & Cie. of Schaffhouse into the of The Book of Thoth Tarot's Two of Disks.

There are numerous published books that discuss the usage of the tarot for divination.  In many systems, the four suits are associated with the four elements: Swords with air, Wands with fire, Cups with water and Pentacles with earth. The numerology of the cards is also considered significant. The tarot is considered to correspond to various systems such as astrology, Pythagorean numerology, the Kabalah (where each of the major arcana represent a path on the tree of life), the I Ching, Christianity [http://www.tarotexplained.com], Aura-Soma and others.

===Spreads===
To perform a Tarot reading, the Tarot deck is typically shuffled by either the subject or a third-party reader, and is laid out in one of a variety of patterns, often called "spreads".  They are then interpreted by the reader or a third-party performing the reading for the subject. These might include the subject's thoughts and desires (known or unknown) or past, present, and future events. Generally, each position in the spread is assigned a number, and the cards are turned over in that sequence, with each card being contemplated/interpreted before moving to the next. Each position is also associated with an interpretation, which indicates what aspect of the question the card in that position is referring to.
