Earth's outer surface is divided into several rigid segments, or many millions of years.

Earth's only known natural satellite, the Moon, which began orbiting it about 4.53 billion years ago, provides ocean tides, stabilizes the axial tilt and gradually slows the planet's rotation. A cometary bombardment during the early history of the planet played a role in the formation of the oceans.<ref name="comet"></ref>  Later, asteroid impacts caused significant changes to the surface environment.

==History==

Scientists have been able to reconstruct detailed information about the planet's past. Earth and the other planets in the Solar System formed 4.54&nbsp;billion&nbsp;years ago<ref name="age_earth" /> out of the Theia) with about 10% of the Earth's mass<ref></ref> impacting the Earth in a glancing blow.<ref></ref> Some of this object's mass would have merged with the Earth and a portion would have been ejected into space, but enough material would have been sent into orbit to form the Moon.

Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing produced the oceans.<ref name="comet"/> The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4&nbsp;billion&nbsp;years ago, and half a billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life existed.<ref></ref>

The development of development of complex cells called eukaryotes.<ref></ref> True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized the surface of Earth.<ref></ref>

Beginning with almost no dry land, the total amount of surface lying above the oceans has steadily increased. During the past two billion years, for example, the total size of the continents
has doubled.<ref name=ward_brownlee>Ward and Brownlee (2002)</ref> As the surface continually reshaped itself, over hundreds of millions of years, continents formed and broke up. The continents migrated across the surface, occasionally combining to form a mya), the earliest known supercontinent, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia, 600–540&nbsp;mya, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart 180&nbsp;mya.<ref></ref>

Since the 1960s, it has been hypothesized that severe glacial action between 750 and 580&nbsp;mya, during the Neoproterozoic, covered much of the planet in a sheet of ice. This hypothesis has been termed "Snowball Earth", and is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms began to proliferate.<ref></ref>

Following the mass extinctions.<ref></ref> The last extinction event occurred 65&nbsp;mya, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the (non-avian) dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals, which then resembled shrews. Over the past 65&nbsp;million years, mammalian life has diversified, and several mya, an African ape-like animal gained the ability to stand upright.<ref></ref> This enabled tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, allowed humans to influence the Earth in a short time span as no other life form had,<ref>{{cite journal

The present pattern of ice ages began about 40&nbsp;mya, then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3&nbsp;mya. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40&ndash;100,000&nbsp;years. The last ice age ended 10,000&nbsp;years ago.<ref></ref>

==Composition and structure==

Earth is a terrestrial planet, meaning that it is a rocky body, rather than a gas giant like Jupiter. It is the largest of the four solar terrestrial planets, both in terms of size and mass. Of these four planets, Earth also has the highest density, the highest surface gravity and the strongest magnetic field.<ref>{{cite web

===Chemical composition===

The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98&nbsp;kg. It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to mass segregation, the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%),
and less than 1% trace elements.<ref></ref>

The geochemist F. W. Clarke calculated that a little more than 47% of the Earth's crust consists of oxygen. The more common rock constituents of the Earth's crust are nearly all oxides; chlorine, sulfur and fluorine are the only important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. The principal oxides are silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash and soda. The silica functions principally as an acid, forming silicates, and all the commonest minerals of igneous rocks are of this nature. From a computation based on 1,672 analyses of all kinds of rocks, Clarke deduced that 99.22% were composed of 11 oxides (see the table at right.) All the other constituents occur only in very small quantities.<ref name=EB1911></ref>

===Internal structure===

The interior of the Earth, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is silicate solid crust, a highly viscous mantle, a liquid outer core that is much less viscous than the mantle, and a solid inner core. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity, and the thickness of the crust varies: averaging 6&nbsp;km under the oceans and 30&ndash;50&nbsp;km on the continents.<ref>{{cite book

===Tectonic plates===

According to plate tectonics theory, the outermost part of the Earth's interior is made up of two layers: the crust, and the solidified uppermost part of the mantle. Below the lithosphere lies the asthenosphere, which forms the inner part of the upper mantle. The asthenosphere behaves like a superheated material that is in a semi-fluidic, plastic-like state.<ref>{{cite web

The lithosphere essentially ''floats'' on the asthenosphere and is broken up into what are called tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent, divergent and transform. The last occurs where two plates move laterally relative to each other, creating a mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries.<ref></ref>

The main plates are:<ref></ref>

Notable minor plates include the Indian Plate, the Arabian Plate, the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate actually fused with Indian Plate between 50 and 55 million years ago.

As the tectonic plates migrate across the planet, the ocean floor is subducted under the leading edges. At the same time, upwellings of mantle material create a divergent boundary along mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes continually recycles the oceanic crustal material. Most of the ocean floor is less than 100 million years in age. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific, and has an estimated age of about 200 million years. By comparison, the oldest fossils found on land have an age of about 3 billion years.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors.<ref></ref> Sedimentary rock
is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes compacted together. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form only about 5% of the crust.<ref></ref> The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both.

===Hydrosphere===

thumb|300px|Elevation [[histogram of the surface of the Earth&mdash;approximately 71% of the Earth's surface is covered with water.]]
The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the "Blue Planet" from others in the solar system. The Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000&nbsp;m. The deepest underwater location is Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of −10,911.4&nbsp;m.<ref>This is the measurement taken by the vessel ''Kaikō'' in March 1995 and is believed to be the most accurate measurement to date. See the Challenger Deep article for more details.</ref><ref></ref> The average depth of the oceans is 3,800&nbsp;m, more than four times the average height of the continents.<ref name=sverdrup/>

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35&nbsp;metric tons, or about 1/4400 of the total mass of the Earth, and occupies a volume of 1.386&nbsp;km³. If all of the land on Earth were spread evenly, water would rise to an altitude of more than 2.7&nbsp;km.<ref>The total volume of the Earth's oceans is: 1.4&nbsp;km³. The total surface area of the Earth is 5.1&nbsp;km². So, to first approximation, the average depth would be the ratio of the two, or 2.7&nbsp;km.</ref> About 97.5% of the water is saline, while the remaining 2.5% is fresh water. The majority of the fresh water, about 68.7%, is currently in the form of ice.<ref></ref>

About 3.5% of the total mass of the oceans consists of salt. Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool, igneous rocks.<ref></ref> The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.<ref></ref> Sea water has an important influence on the world's
climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir.<ref>{{cite web | last = Scott | first = Michon | date = 2006-04-24 | url = http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Study/HeatBucket/ | title = Earth's Big heat Bucket | publisher = NASA Earth Observatory | accessdate = 2007-03-14

===Atmosphere===

The atmospheric pressure on the surface of the Earth averages 101.325&nbsp;kPa, with a scale height of about 8.5&nbsp;km.<ref name="earth_fact_sheet"/> It is 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with trace amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules. The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 7&nbsp;km  at the poles to 17&nbsp;km  at the equator, with some variation due to weather factors.

Earth's Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 billion years ago, forming the primarily nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere that exists today. This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life on Earth's include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.<ref name="atmosphere"></ref> This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18&nbsp;°C and life would likely not exist.<ref name="Pidwirny2006" />

====Weather and climate====

The Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11&nbsp;km of the planet's surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower density air then rises, and is replaced by cooler, higher density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of heat energy.<ref name="moran2005"></ref>

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between
30° and 60°.<ref name="berger2002">{{cite web

Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere.
When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and settles to the surface as precipitation.<ref name="moran2005" /> Most of the water is then transported back to lower elevations by river systems, usually returning to the oceans or being deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land, and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topological features and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.<ref>{{cite web

====Upper atmosphere====

Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.<ref name="atmosphere" /> Each of these layers has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere (where the Earth's magnetic fields interact with the solar wind).<ref></ref> An important part of the atmosphere for life on Earth is the ozone layer, a component of the stratosphere that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light.

Due to thermal energy, some of the molecules at the outer edge of the Earth's atmosphere have their velocity increased to the point where they can escape from the planet's gravity. This results in a slow but steady leakage of the atmosphere into space.

==Orbit and rotation==

thumb|right|175px|An animation showing the rotation of the Earth as seen from the northern hemisphere of the solar system.
Relative to the background stars, it takes the Earth, on average, 23&nbsp;hours, 56&nbsp;minutes and 4.091&nbsp;seconds (one sidereal day) to rotate around the axis that connects the north and the south poles from west to east.<ref></ref> From Earth, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in the sky (except that of meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites) is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. This is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or Moon every two minutes. (The apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.)

Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150&nbsp;million kilometers every 365.2564&nbsp;mean&nbsp;solar&nbsp;days (1 sidereal&nbsp;year). From Earth, this gives an apparent movement of the Sun with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day (or a Sun or Moon diameter every 12&nbsp;hours) eastward. Because of this motion, on average it takes 24 hours&mdash;a solar day&mdash;for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian. The orbital speed of the Earth averages about 30&nbsp;km/s (108,000&nbsp;km/h), which is fast enough to cover the planet's diameter (about 12,600&nbsp;km) in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon (384,000&nbsp;km) in four hours.<ref name="earth_fact_sheet"></ref>

The Moon revolves with the Earth around a common celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon and their axial rotations are all axis is tilted some 23.5&nbsp;degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (which causes the seasons); and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted about 5&nbsp;degrees against the Earth-Sun plane (without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses).<ref name="moon_fact_sheet"></ref><ref name="earth_fact_sheet" />

Because of the axial tilt of the Earth, the position of the Sun in the sky (as seen by an observer on the surface) varies over the course of the year. For an observer at a northern latitude, when the northern pole is tilted toward the Sun the day lasts longer and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. This results in warmer average temperatures from the increase in solar radiation reaching the surface. When the northern pole is tilted away from the Sun, the reverse is true and the climate is generally cooler. Above the arctic circle, an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year. (This is called a polar night.)

thumb|left|195px|[[Pale Blue Dot|Earth seen as a tiny dot by the Voyager 1 spacecraft, more than 6 billion kilometers from Earth.]]
This variation in the climate (because of the direction of the Earth's axial tilt) results in the seasons. By astronomical convention, the four seasons are determined by the solstices&mdash;the point in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun&mdash;and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. Winter solstice occurs on about December 21, summer solstice is near June 21, spring equinox is around March 20 and autumnal equinox is about September 23. The axial tilt in the southern hemisphere is exactly the opposite of the direction in the northern hemisphere. Thus the seasonal effects in the south are reversed.

The angle of the Earth's tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. However, the tilt does undergo a slight, irregular motion (known as precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800&nbsp;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and Moon on the Earth's equatorial bulge. From the perspective of the Earth, the poles also migrate a few meters across the surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. The rotational velocity of the Earth also varies in a phenomenon known as length of day variation.<ref></ref>

In modern times, Earth's precession and Milankovitch cycles). The changing Earth-Sun distance results in an increase of about 6.9%<ref>Aphelion is 103.4% of the distance to perihelion. Due to the inverse square law, the radiation at perihelion is about 106.9% the energy at aphelion.</ref> in solar energy reaching the Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Since the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that the Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. However, this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere.<ref></ref>

The gravitational sphere of influence) of the Earth is about 1.5&nbsp;Gm (or 1,500,000 kilometers)  in radius.<ref></ref><ref>For the Earth, the Hill radius is

:<math>\begin{smallmatrix} R_H = a\left ( \frac{m}{3M} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}} \end{smallmatrix}</math>,

where ''m'' is the mass of the Earth, ''a'' is an Astronomical Unit, and ''M'' is the mass of the Sun. So the radius in A.U. is about:

<math>\begin{smallmatrix} \left ( \frac{1}{3 \cdot 332,946} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}} = 0.01 \end{smallmatrix}</math>.</ref> This is maximum distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit the Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

The Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of the Earth's. It is the largest moon in the solar system relative to the size of its planet. (Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto.) The natural satellites orbiting other planets are called "moons" after Earth's Moon.

The gravitational attraction between the Earth and Moon causes solar terminator.

Because of their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38&nbsp;mm a year. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23 µs a year—add up to significant changes.<ref>{{cite web

Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have very nearly the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant. This allows total and annular eclipses to occur on Earth.
