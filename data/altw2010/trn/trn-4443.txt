==Biography==
Gilels was born in Odessa to a musical family. He began studying the piano at the age of five<ref name="Mach" /> under Yakov Tkach, who was a student of the French pianists Raoul Pugno<ref>[http://www.naxos.com/artistinfo/bio14380.htm Gilels biography on Naxos.com]</ref> and Alexander Villoing<ref name="Mach" /> Thus, through Tkach, Gilels had a pedagogical genealogy stretching back to Chopin, via Pugno, and to Muzio Clementi, via Villoing. Tkach was a stern disciplinarian who emphasized scales and studies.  Gilels later credited this strict training for establishing the foundation of his technique.<ref name="Mach">{{cite book

Gilels made his public debut at the age of 12 in June 1929  with a well-received program of Scarlatti, Chopin, and Schumann.<ref name="Mach" /> In 1930, Gilels entered the Odessa Conservatory where he was coached by Berta Reingbald, whom Gilels credited as a formative influence.   

After graduating from the Odessa Conservatory (Ukraine) in 1935 , he moved to Moscow where he studied under the famous piano teacher Heinrich Neuhaus until 1937. 

A year later he was awarded first prize at the 1938 Ysaÿe International Festival in Brussels by a distinguished jury whose members included Arthur Rubinstein, Samuil Feinberg, Emil von Sauer, Ignaz Friedman, Walter Gieseking, Robert Casadesus, and Arthur Bliss.<ref>Facsimile of Gilels's 1938 Ysaÿe Competition First Prize Certificate in: S. Khentova, ''Emil Gilels'' (unknown publisher, Moscow 1959).</ref> His winning performances were of both volumes of the Brahms-Paganini variations, and the Liszt-Busoni Fantasie on Two Motives from Mozart's "Marriage of Figaro". The other competitors included Moura Lympany in second place, and Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli in seventh place.<ref>{{cite web

}} Michelangeli and Lympany took 7th and 2nd place respectively.</ref>

Following his triumph at Brussels, a scheduled American debut at the 1939 New York World's Fair was aborted due to the outbreak of the Second World War. 

During the War, Gilels entertained Soviet troops with morale-boosting open-air recitals on the frontline, of which film archive footage exists.<ref>"Emil Gilels Plays", Russian television documentary, VHS release on Japanese label IVC, cat. no. IVCV-64144</ref>

In 1945, he formed a chamber music trio with his brother-in-law, the violinist Leonid Kogan and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.

After the war, he toured the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe as a soloist. He also gave two-piano recitals with Yakov Flier, as well as concerts with his violinist sister, Elizaveta. 

Gilels was one of the first Soviet artists, along with West.  His delayed American debut in 1955  playing Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 in Philadelphia with Eugene Ormandy was a great success. His British debut in 1959 met with similar acclaim.

In 1952, he became a professor at the Moscow Conservatory, where his students included Valery Afanassiev[http://einam.com/pages/russian.htm] and Felix Gottlieb[http://www.felixgottlieb.com/eng/bio.htm]. He presided over the International Tchaikovsky Competition for many years, and as chair of the jury awarded first prize to Van Cliburn at the sensational inaugural event in 1958.
