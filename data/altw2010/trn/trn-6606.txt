Uma '''partitura''' é uma representação escrita de notas musicais) que se associam a sons.

No contexto da música assistida por computador, a partitura, ao contrário das tablaturas, desempenha um papel crucial. Através de tecnologias como MIDI é possível traduzir uma partitura integralmente para um formato legível pelo computador ou instrumentos electrónicos (como sintetizadores) para posterior reprodução.

==Notação==

Uma partitura não exprime apenas um instrumento. Pode incluir vários, cada um designado por ''voz'' e mesmo a letra da música.

Todas as partiruras possuem sempre 5 linhas, e cada linha pode representar uma nota musical, dependendo da Clave. 
As claves são:

Clave de Sol - iniciada apartir da 2ª linha, de baixo para cima com a nota sol.
Clave de Fá - iniciada apartir da 2ª linha, de cima para baixo com a nota fá.
Clave de Dó - iniciada apartir da 3ª linha, de cima para baixo (ou vice-versa) com a nota sol.

==Software de edição==
Existem várias aplicações para conceber partituras:
* Finale
* Rosegarden
* Lilypond (baseado em TeX)
* MusiXTeX (baseado em TeX)
* Encore (extensões do tipo *.enc e *.mid)
* Cake Walk Express (extensões do tipo *.mid)
* Denemo
* Sibelius
* GuitarPro

'''Sheet music''' is a hand-written or printed form of musical notation; like its analogs -- books, pamphlets, etc. -- the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier times, parchment), although the access to musical notation in recent years includes also presentation on computer screens. Use of the term "sheet" is intended to differentiate music on paper from an audio presentation, which would ensue from a sound recording, broadcast, or live performance, which may involve video as well.  In everyday use, "sheet music" (or simply "music") can refer to the print publication of commercial music in conjunction with the release of a new film, show, record album, or other special or popular event which involves music.

A common alternative (and more generic) term for sheet music is ''score'', and there are several types of scores, as discussed below.  ''(Note:  the term ''score'' can also refer to play, television programme, or film; for the last of these, see film score.)''

==Purpose and use==
Sheet music can be used as a record of, a guide to, or a means to perform, a piece of music.  Although it does not take the place of the sound of a performed work, sheet music can be studied to create a performance and to elucidate aspects of the music that may not be obvious from mere listening.  Authoritative musical information about a piece can be gained by studying the written sketches and early versions of compositions that the composer might have retained, as well as the final autograph score and personal markings on proofs and printed scores.  

Comprehending sheet music requires a special form of John Stanley and the 20th-century composers and lyricists Lionel Bart and Paul McCartney.

The skill of melodies, harmonies, timbres, etc.) in one's head without having to play the piece.

With the exception of solo performances, where memorization is expected, classical musicians ordinarily have the sheet music at hand when performing. Even in improvised, sheet music is used to give basic indications of melodies, chord changes, and arrangements.

Handwritten or printed music is less important in other traditions of musical practice, however. Although much learn a piece by ear. This is also the case in most forms of western dances are passed down by oral -- and aural -- tradition. Music of other cultures, both folk and classical, is often transmitted orally, though some non-western cultures developed their own forms of musical notation and sheet music as well.  <!-- The following sentence doesn't seem to fit in to this topic, or needs more explanation of its relation to sheet music:  Certain cultures use hand signals or some other device as a learning mnemonic.-->

Although sheet music is often thought of as being a platform for new music and an aid to composition (i.e., the composer ''writes'' the music down), it can also serve as a visual record of music that already exists.  Scholars and others have made transcriptions of western and non-western musics so as to render them in readable form for study, analysis, and re-creative performance.  This has been done not only with folk or traditional music (e.g., Bartók's volumes of Magyar and Romanian folk music), but also with sound recordings of improvisations by musicians (e.g., jazz piano) and performances that may only partially be based on notation.  An exhaustive example of the latter in recent times is the collection ''The Beatles:  Complete Scores'' (London: Wise Publications,  c1993), which seeks to transcribe into staves and tablature all the songs as recorded by the Beatles in instrumental and vocal detail.

== Types ==
Modern sheet music may come in different formats. If a piece is composed for just one instrument or voice (such as a piece for a solo instrument or for ''a cappella'' solo voice), the whole work may be written or printed as one piece of sheet music. If an instrumental piece is intended to be performed by more than one person, each performer will usually have a separate piece of sheet music, called a ''part'', to play from.  This is especially the case in the publication of works requiring more than four or so performers, though invariably a full ''score'' is published as well. The sung parts in a vocal work are not usually issued separately today, although this was historically the case, especially before music printing made sheet music widely available. 

Sheet music can be issued as individual pieces or works (for example a popular song or a Beethoven sonata), in collections (for example works by one or several composers), as pieces performed by a given artist, etc.

When the separate instrumental and vocal parts of a musical work are printed together, the resulting sheet music is called a ''score''.  Conventionally, a score consists of musical notation with each instrumental or vocal part in vertical alignment (meaning that concurrent events in the notation for each part are orthographically arranged).  The term ''score'' has also been used to refer to sheet music written for only one performer.  The distinction between ''score'' and ''part'' applies when there is more than one part needed for performance.

Scores come in various formats, as follows:

thumb|A conductor's score

*A ''full score'' is a large book showing the music of all instruments and voices in a composition lined up in a fixed order. It is large enough for a conductor to be able to read it while directing rehearsals and performances.
*A ''miniature score'' is like a full score but much reduced in size. It is too small for practical use but handy for studying a piece of music, whether it be for a large ensemble or a solo performer.  A miniature score may contain some introductory remarks.
*A ''study score'' is sometimes the same size as, and often indistinguishable from, a ''miniature score'', except in name.  Some study scores are octavo size and are thus somewhere between full and miniature score sizes.   A study score, especially when part of an anthology for academic study, may include extra comments about the music and markings for learning purposes.
*A ''piano score'' (or ''transcription for piano of a piece intended for many performing parts, especially orchestral works; this can include purely instrumental sections within large vocal works (see ''vocal score'' immediately below).  Such arrangements are made for either piano solo (two hands) or piano Liszt's concert transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies being a notable exception), ballets get the most practical benefit most from piano scores because with one or two pianists they allow unlimited rehearsal before the orchestra is absolutely needed.  They can be used also to train beginning conductors.  Piano scores of operas do not include separate staves for the vocal parts, but they may add the sung text and stage directions above the music.

*A ''vocal score'' (or, more properly, ''piano-vocal score'') is a reduction of the full score of a vocal work (e.g., musical, solo and choral) on their staves and the orchestral parts in a piano reduction (usually for two hands) underneath the vocal parts; the purely orchestral sections of the score are also reduced for piano.  If a portion of the work is ''musical typically does not include the spoken dialogue, except for cues.
**The related but less common ''choral score'' contains the choral parts with no accompaniment.
**The comparable ''organ score'' exists as well, usually in association with church music for voices and orchestra, such as arrangements (by later hands) of Handel's ''Messiah''.  It is like the piano-vocal score in that it includes staves for the vocal parts and reduces the orchestral parts to be performed by one person.  Unlike the vocal score, the organ score is sometimes intended by the arranger to substitute for the orchestra in performance if necessary.
**A collection of songs from a given musical is usually printed under the label ''vocal selections''.  This is different from the vocal score from the same show in that it does not present the complete music, and the piano accompaniment usually is simplified and includes the melody line.
*A ''short score'' is a reduction of a work for many instruments to just a few staves.  Rather than composing directly in full score, many composers work out some type of short score while they are composing and later expand the complete orchestration.  (An opera, for instance, may be written first in a short score, then in full score, then reduced to a vocal score for rehearsal.)  Short scores are often not published; they may be more common for some performance venues (e.g., band) than in others.
*A ''lead sheet'' specifies only the melody, lyrics and harmony, using one staff with chord symbols placed above and lyrics below. It is commonly used in popular music to capture the essential elements of song without specifying how the song should be arranged or performed.
*A ''popular music and is intended primarily for the bass and drums).

===Manuscripts===
Before the 15th century, western music was written by hand and preserved in monophonic chant.  In the case of medieval polyphony, such as the motet, writing space was economized by copying the parts in separate portions of facing pages, thus making possible performance by the fewest number of soloists needed.  (This process was aided by the advent of mensural notation to clarify rhythm and was paralleled by the medieval practice of composing parts of polyphony sequentially, rather than simultaneously as in later times.)  Manuscripts showing parts together in score format were rare, and limited mostly to organum, especially that of the Notre Dame school.

Even after the advent of music printing, much music continued to exist solely in manuscripts well into the 18th century.

===Printing===

There were several difficulties in translating the new technology of printing to music. The first printed book to include music, the incunabulae for capitals. The psalter was printed in Mainz, Germany by Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer, and one now resides in Windsor Castle and another at the British Library. Later staff lines were printed, but scribes still added in the rest of the music by hand. The greatest difficulty in using movable type to print music is that all the elements must line up - the note head must be properly aligned with the staff, or else it means something other than it should. In vocal music text must be aligned with the proper notes (although at this time even in manuscripts this was not a high priority).
