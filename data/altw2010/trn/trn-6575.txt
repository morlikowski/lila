==Plot summary==
Iris Estelle King is a working-class mother with a job at a large commercial bakery who is still getting over the death of her husband though her life working paycheck to paycheck does not give her much time to grieve. She is sharing her house with her two children, Kelly and Richard, her unemployed sister Sharon, and her thuggish brother-in-law Joe. Joe assaults Sharon and crime in the community is commonplace including robbery, burglary and assault.

One of the few bright spots in her life is her blossoming friendship with Stanley Everett Cox, a nice guy who she first meets when he comes to her aid when her purse is taken by a street thug. Stanley works in the bakery's cafeteria. Stanley longs for country life and Iris is a city girl. However, Iris starts noticing a few odd things about Stanley. He cannot sign his name, does not drive and lives with his father. It slowly dawns on Iris that he can not read. When his boss figures this out, Stanley loses his job. Iris spots Stanley at a bar and he confides in her how difficult it is to be illiterate; you cannot find where you are going because you cannot read signs. The loss of his job is an especially troubling development, as Stanley is evicted and has to put his father in a retirement home. His father dies in the home and Stanley feels very guilty over not having a job and being able to give his father a better place to spend his final years. Stanley is homeless and out of work, but is living in a garage.

== Kritiken ==

Rita Kempley schrieb in der Washington Post vom 9. Februar 1990, dass Jane Fonda anscheinend gerne Arbeiterinnen spiele. In dieser Rolle wirke sie nicht so glaubwürdig wie Robert De Niro als Koch. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/stanleyirispg13kempley_a09ff5.htm Kritik von Rita Kempley]</ref>
