'''''Stagger Lee''''' est le titre d'une chanson traditionnelle américaine. Les paroles s'inspirent d'un fait divers qui s'est déroulé en 1895. Il en existe de nombreuses reprises sous différents titres, dont la plus célèbre est celle de Lloyd Price.

La chanson raconte l'histoire vraie de Lee Sheldon, proxénète noir de Saint-Louis, Missouri, condamné pour le meurtre de son ami William Lyons le jour du réveillon de Noël. Shelton est mort en prison en 1912 de la tuberculose.

Il semble que la chanson soit née immédiatement après les faits. Une des versions les plus anciennes qui nous est parvenue est celle enregistrée en 1910 par le folkloriste 1958 une version 1959<ref> Hot 100 number-one hits of 1959 (USA)</ref>, est classée 456 parmi ''les 500 plus grandes chansons de tous les temps'' du magazine Rolling Stone.

'''Lee Shelton''' (also known as '''Stagger Lee''', '''Stagolee''', '''Stackerlee''', '''Stack O'Lee''', '''Stack-a-Lee''' and by several other spelling variants) was a black cab driver and a pimp<ref>[http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2007-06-27/news/the-story-of-stagger-lee/ The Story of Stagger Lee in the Riverfront Times of St. Louis]</ref> convicted of murdering William Lyons on Christmas Eve, 1895 in St. Louis, Missouri.  The crime was immortalized in a blues folk song that has been recorded in hundreds of different versions. 

Lee Shelton was not just a common pimp, but as described by Cecil Brown,<ref>Brown, Cecil, Stagolee Shot Billy, Harvard University Press, 2003</ref> "Lee Shelton belonged to a group of pimps known in St. Louis as the 'Macks'. The macks were not just 'urban strollers'; they presented themselves as objects to be observed."

Shelton died in prison in 1912, of tuberculosis. 

==The crime==

A story appearing in the St. Louis, Missouri ''Globe-Democrat'' in 1895 says:
<blockquote>
    William Lyons, 25, a levee hand, was shot in the abdomen yesterday evening at 10 o'clock in the saloon of Bill Curtis, at Eleventh and Morgan Streets, by Lee Shelton, a carriage driver. Lyons and Shelton were friends and were talking together. Both parties, it seems, had been drinking and were feeling in exuberant spirits. The discussion drifted to politics, and an argument was started, the conclusion of which was that Lyons snatched Shelton's hat from his head. The latter indignantly demanded its return. Lyons refused, and Shelton withdrew his revolver and shot Lyons in the abdomen. When his victim fell to the floor Shelton took his hat from the hand of the wounded man and coolly walked away. He was subsequently arrested and locked up at the Chestnut Street Station. Lyons was taken to the Dispensary, where his wounds were pronounced serious. Lee Shelton is also known as 'Stagger' Lee.[1]
</blockquote>

Lyons eventually died of his injuries. Shelton was tried, convicted, and served prison time for this crime. This otherwise unmemorable crime is remembered in a song. In some older versions of the song, the name of the other party is given as "Billy Deslile" or "De Lion".

==Stagger Lee as archetype==
 
Immortalized in song, Stagger Lee has become an archetype, the embodiment of a tough-guy black man -- one who is sly, streetwise, cool, lawless, amoral, potentially violent, and who often defies white authority.<ref></ref>

Author and music critic Greil Marcus explicitly ties the Stagger Lee archetype to Sly Stone and his album ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' in his book ''Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock 'n' Roll Music''.

==The songs==

The song has been recorded hundreds of times by a great variety of performers. The version recorded by Dick Clark felt that the original tale of murder was too morbid for his ''American Bandstand'' audience, and insisted that they be changed (with no murder taking place).<ref></ref> Despite the changes, it was the original version of the song that made #1 and was ranked #456 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. 

There is speculation that "Stag O Lee" songs predated even the 1895 incident, and Lee Shelton may have gotten his nickname from earlier folk songs. Other sources say that black roustabouts on Mississippi River docks were called "stack o lees" as they would stack cargo on the lee side of the docks. The first published version of the song was done by folklorist John Lomax in 1910. The song was well known in African American communities along the lower Mississippi River by the 1910s. 

Before World War II, it was almost always known as "Stack O'Lee". W.C. Handy wrote that this probably was a nickname for a tall person, comparing him to the tall smoke-stack of the large steamboat ''Robert E. Lee''. By the time that W.C. Handy wrote the explanation in the 1920s, "Stack O' Lee" was already familiar in United States popular culture, with recordings of the song made by such pop singers of the day as Cliff Edwards.

An early Blues recording of the song from 1928 was made by Mississippi John Hurt, a blues musician. His lyrics:   

:<i>Po-lice officer, how can it be?
:You can 'rest everybody but cruel Stagolee
:That bad man, oh cruel Stagolee

:Billy DeLyon told Stagolee, "Please don't take my life
:I got two little babes and a darling, loving wife"
:That bad man, oh cruel Stagolee

:"What'd I care about your two little babes and darling, loving wife?
:You done stole my Stetson hat, I'm bound to take your life."
:That bad man, oh cruel Stagolee

:Boom boom, boom boom,
:Went the forty-four.
:Well when I spied Billy DeLyon
:He's lyin' down on the floor.
:That bad man, oh cruel Stagolee

:Gentlemens of the Jury,
:What you think of that?
:Stagolee killed Billy DeLyon
:'bout a five-dollar Stetson hat.
:That bad man, oh cruel Stagolee

:Standin' on the gallows, head way up high
:At twelve o'clock, they killed him, they's all glad to see him die
:That bad man, oh cruel Stagolee''

As in all such pieces, there are many (sometimes anachronistic) variants on the lyrics.  Several older versions give Billy's last name as "De Lyons" or "Deslile".

A 1959 variation, credited as "traditional", as originally recorded and performed by Lloyd Price, goes:

: (intro) <i>The night was clear, and the moon was yellow
:''And the leaves came tumblin' down. . . </i>

:<i>I was standing on a corner
:When I heard my bull dog bark
:He was barking at the two men
:Who were gambling in the dark

:It was Stagger Lee and Billy
:Two men who gambled late
:Stagger Lee drew a seven
:Billy swore that he drew eight

:Stagger Lee told Billy
:"I can't let you go with that
:You have won all my money
:And my brand new Stetson hat."
