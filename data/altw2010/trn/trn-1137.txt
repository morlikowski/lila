'''pSX emulator''' (more commonly referred to as ''pSX'') is a  operating systems. Its first public Windows version (1.0) was released on  January 29,  February 24, 2007. pSX is freeware, available for download.

pSX doesn't use GPU, SPU and CD drive functions of the PlayStation. Instead, simplicity and ease-of-use are favored over a high level of configurability. Despite the fact that it avoids the use of external files to aid in emulation of the PlayStation, the emulator still requires a user-provided PlayStation BIOS dump to work.

==Goal==
pSX is an attempt to accurately emulate the PlayStation hardware as closely as possible (with an emphasis on greater compatibility). One advantage of focusing only on accuracy and compatibility is that there are fewer worries for the author with regards to implementing or fixing enhancement options. There is also little worry over graphics card compatibility because the graphics are mainly software rendered. The main drawback with pSX's approach to emulation is that it cannot offer sharper image quality than the PlayStation itself.

==Features==
* Support for loading games from various CD image formats, or directly from CD drives
* Emulation of the classic (digital) PlayStation controller, the SCPH-1150 prototype DualShock controller, and the DualShock controller
* Emulation of the Namco GunCon peripheral by mouse (Windows version only)
* Localization (mainly by user contribution)
* On-the-fly PPF patching via command line

===Supported CD Image Formats===
pSX emulator supports direct loading of ISO, BIN/CUE, Alcohol 120% images (MDF/MDS) and CloneCD images (CCD/CUE/IMG/SUB). Either Alcohol 120% or CloneCD format is required if the game uses subcode data. Regardless of the device they are read from, disc images are automatically cached into RAM as they are read, reducing device acess rates on high memory systems. In addition to these formats, pSX is able to use a compressed format (developed by pSX Author himself) called CDZ. The compression algorithm used in CDZ is based on zlib compression. This format was created in order to save hard drive space while maintaining the ability to perform random data access (which is required for the games, but not supported with the more common data compression formats). Images compressed with CDZ also use up less cache memory. As of pSX 1.12, all supported CD image formats besides ISO can be converted into CDZ. The CDZ converter will include all relevant files in the final CDZ file, so image formats that make use of multiple files (such as CloneCD's CCD/CUE/IMG/SUB images) are stored in the single CDZ file. Users can convert images using the GUI included in the emulator, or use the commandline utility (cdztool.exe), which is  located in the utils folder included with the emulator.

===Localization===
Support for localization was added in version 1.10, which included translations of the main user interface in various languages. The translations are mainly provided by users on the official support forums. While the readme is currently English-only, there are plans for it to be translated as well following a pending rewrite. Support for more languages is also a constant goal, with 24 languages (English and 1337 Speak among them) included as of pSX 1.13.

==System Requirements==
Although the readme that comes with the emulator does not list any specific system requirements, system requirements have been drawn based on user input. Note that the minimum requirements listed here are for getting some (but not necessarily all) games running at full speed.

'''Minimum System Requirements:'''
* CPU: 600 MHz (750 MHz on Windows XP)
* Memory: 128 MB RAM (192 MB on Windows XP)
* CD-ROM: 2x read, ASPI-compatible, or any CD-compatible virtual drive

'''Recommended System Requirements:'''
* CPU: 1.3 GHz
* Memory: 256 MB RAM
* CD-ROM: 16x read, ASPI-compatible, or any CD-compatible virtual drive

'''pSX emulator''' — бесплатный игровой приставки Sony PlayStation. Релиз эмулятора состоялся 4 февраля 2006 года.

Выгодным отличием от других эмуляторов PS1 является простота использования, которая достигается засчёт самодостаточности эмулятора, отсутствия необходимости установки сторонних плагинов. Функции графического процессора, звуковой системы, CD-привода уже включены в эмулятор.

Как большинство эмуляторов приставок пятого поколения, pSX emulator осуществляет высокоуровневую эмуляцию, поэтому для его работы необходим файл с дампом BIOS PlayStation. 

Поддерживаемые форматы CD-образов: *.iso, *.bin, *.cue, *.ccd, *.cdz, *.img.
