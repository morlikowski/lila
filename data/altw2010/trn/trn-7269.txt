'''"Lethal Weapons"''' is an episode from the third season of the FOX animated series ''Family Guy''. It is the 35th episode of ''Family Guy''. Michael Chiklis guest stars as a "leafer."

==Plot summary==
The quiet of Quahog is disrupted when the leaves start turning fall colors and "leafers" from New York invade town.

Bonnie invites Lois to a Tae Jitsu class where Lois quickly advances to black belt. Peter exploits Lois' fighting abilities to drive the leafers back to New York. This gets Lois aggressive enough to challenge and successfully beat her teacher.

Her victory over her teacher makes her so assertive she immediately kisses Peter and then grabs him by the crotch, to which she claims ownership (the gender opposite of what O.J. Simpson was reported to have done to his late wife <ref name="OJ">[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/Dardenca.htm A transcript of the prosecutor's closing argument in O.J. Simpson's murder trial]</ref>). That night Lois rapes Peter, who is too frightened to object.

The next morning, Peter feels emasculated and cries. While sharing his feelings with Brian, he eats graham crackers belonging to Stewie. Stewie promptly strikes Peter, with a baseball bat. Lois blames herself for serving as a bad role model, and decides to rid the family of anger.

Family therapy fails to rid Stewie of his rage issues (he bites the psychiatrist's ear in a manner reminiscent of Mike Tyson), and so does an attempt by Brian to convince them they've taken mood elevating drugs, when he really gave them placebos.

The family ends up in an all-out brawl to get it out of their system. They start to realize how ridiculous the fighting is after Peter gets his head stuck in a picture of a horse (the butt-end, of course), but continue fighting after Stewie hits Lois from behind with a chair.
