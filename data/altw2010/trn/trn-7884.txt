'''Paroxetin''' er et selektive serotoninreopptakshemmere. I Norge markedsføres preparatet som ''Seroxat'' og ''Paroxetin''. ''''Paroksetin''' er også godkjent til bruk mot tvangslidelse, panikklidelse, sosial angstlidelse, generalisert angstlidelse og posttraumatisk stresslidelse.

==Virkning==
Ved depresjoner er det for lavt nivå av signalstoffet serotonin i den synaptiske kløften mellom nerveceller i hjernen. Dette fører til at det ikke overføres signal fra "avsender cellen" til "mottaker cellen". På "avsender cellen" sitter det et protein som fører serotonin tilbake inn i cellen. Dette er et serotonin reopptak. Som navnet på gruppen tilsier, hemmer paroksetin selektivt reopptaket av serotonin til "avsender cellen" og dette fører til økt nivå av serotonin i den synaptiske kløften.

'''Paroxetine''' ('''Seroxat''', '''Paxil''', '''Parotin''', '''Aropax''', '''Xetanor''', '''ParoMerck''', '''Rexetin''') is a withdrawal syndrome which have resulted in legal proceedings against the manufacturer. 

==Indications==
===Approved===
Paroxetine is primarily used to treat the symptoms of depression, OCD), PTSD), GAD),<ref></ref> social phobia/social anxiety disorder,<ref></ref> and PMDD).<ref></ref>

It was the first antidepressant formally approved in the United States for the treatment of panic attacks.<ref></ref>

According to the prescribing information provided by the manufacturer of Paxil brand of paroxetine GlaxoSmithKline and approved by the FDA<ref name="gsk-paxil"/>, the effectiveness of paroxetine in major depressive disorder has been proven by six placebo-controlled clinical trials. For panic disorder, three 10-12-week studies indicated paroxetine superiority to placebo.<ref name="gsk-paxil"/> Similarly, three 12-week trials for adult outpatients with social anxiety disorder demonstrated better response to paroxetine than to placebo.<ref name="gsk-paxil"/>

===Unapproved/off-label/investigational===

Moreover, however, studies have suggested that paroxetine can infact be used in the treatment of premature ejaculation. In particular, intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) found to increase with a 6-13-fold, which was somewhat longer than those of a predessor.. the delay achieved by the treatment with other SSRIs (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram).<ref name="pmid9690692"></ref><ref name="pmid11763001"></ref><ref name="pmid15363569"></ref> However, paroxetine taken acutely ("on demand") 3–10 hours before coitus resulted only in a "clinically irrelevant and sexually unsatisfactory" 1.5-fold delay of ejaculation and was inferior to clomipramine, which induced a four-fold delay.<ref name="pmid15363569"/>

There is also evidence that paroxetine may be effective in the treatment of compulsive gambling<ref></ref> and hot flashes.<ref></ref>

In two double-blind studies of bipolar disorder patients, addition of paroxetine to a mood stabilizer had no advantages over addition of placebo.<ref name="pmid11384898"></ref><ref name="pmid17392295"></ref> Benefits of paroxetine prescription for diabetic neuropathy<ref></ref> or  chronic tension headache.<ref name="pmid8132436"></ref> are uncertain.

== Pharmacology ==
Paroxetine is the most potent and one of the most specific selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRI).<ref></ref> This activity of the drug on brain neurons is thought to be responsible for its antidepressant effects.

Paroxetine is a tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants. In receptor binding studies, paroxetine did not exhibit significant affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine and noradrenaline receptors was evident. The predominant metabolites of paroxetine are essentially inactive as 5-HT reuptake inhibitors.

== Chemistry ==
Paroxetine hydrochloride is an odorless, off-white powder, having a melting point range of 120° to 138°C and a solubility of 5.4 mg/mL in water.

==Formulations==

Paroxetine CR (controlled release) was shown to be associated with a lower rate of nausea during the first week of treatment than paroxetine immediate release. However, the rate of treatment discontinuation due to nausea was not significantly different.<ref></ref>

==Side effects==

General side effects are mostly present during the first 1-4 weeks while the body adapts to the drug. Almost all SSRIs are known to cause either one or more of these symptoms. A person receiving paroxetine treatment may experience a few, all, or none of the following side-effects, and most side-effects will disappear or lessen with continued treatment, though some may last throughout the duration. Side effects are also often dose-dependent, with fewer and/or less severe symptoms being reported at lower dosages, and/or more severe symptoms being reported at higher dosages. Increases or changes in dosage may also cause symptoms to reappear or worsen. <ref name="gsk-paxil"></ref>

9 December 2004 European Medicines Agency (EMEA), i.e. the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), informed patients, prescribers and parents that paroxetine should not be prescribed to children. CHMP gave a warning to prescribers recommending close monitoring of adult patients at high risk of suicidal behaviour and/or suicidal thoughts. In other words, CHMP does not prohibit use of paroxetine with adults but stresses extreme caution in actual usage. Also withdrawal reactions upon stopping treatment is mentioned and therefore it is recommended to gradually reduce the dose over several weeks or months if decision of withdrawal is made. <ref></ref>

Paroxetine and other SSRIs have been shown to cause sexual side effects in most patients, both males and females<ref></ref>. 

Schmitt et al. (2001) suggested that paroxetine negatively affects cognition (i.e., IQ). In their study, healthy participants given paroxetine for 14 days (20mg for days 1-7 and 40mg days 8-14) showed poorer recall of words on day 14 compared to those receiving a placebo. Schmitt and co-workers, however, did not account for significant differences in verbal recall at baseline between those receiving paroxetine and those receiving a placebo, differences which produced the significant finding.  Furthermore, participants receiving paroxetine recalled as many words at baseline as they recalled on day 14.  Accordingly, the conclusion that paroxetine affects verbal recall was unwarranted.
