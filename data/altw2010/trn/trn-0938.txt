'''Kotonowaka Terumasa''' (jap. ; * 15. Mai 1968 in Obanazawa, Präfektur Yamagata als '''Kamatani Mitsuya''' () ist ein ehemaliger japanischer Sumōringer.

Kotonowaka begann seine Karriere im Mai 1984, zunächst nannte er sich noch ''Konno Mitsuya'' (), ab Juli ''Kotokonno Mitsuya'' (), ab März 1988 ''Kotonowaka Mitsuya'' () – mit Änderung der Schreibweise seines Vornamens –, im September 1998 ''Kotonowaka Masakatsu'' () und schließlich ab Juli 1999 ''Kotonowaka Terumasa''.

Er stieg 1990 in die Juryo-Division auf und gehörte seit 1991 ununterbrochen der Makuuchi-Division an. Er konnte mehrmals in die Sanyaku-Ränge vorstoßen - sein höchster jemals erreichter Rang war 1999 Sekiwake - gehörte aber die meiste Zeit seiner 15-jährigen Zugehörigkeit zur Makuuchi zum festen Inventar der Maegashira-Ränge.

Kotonowaka war bekannt für seinen stark auf Kontertechniken ausgerichteten Stil, durch den seine Kämpfe oft relativ lang gerieten. Auf diesen Umstand spielt sein Spitzname "Mr. Ippun" ("Herr Eine-Minute") an.

Zwar konnte Kotonowaka niemals ein Turnier gewinnen, aber immerhin siegte er achtmal gegen Yokozuna und erhielt im Lauf seiner Karriere fünf Preise für Kampfgeist und zwei für die beste Leistung in einem Turnier.

'''Kotonowaka Terumasa''' (born May 15, 1968 as '''Mitsuya Kamatani''') is a former sumo wrestler from Obanazawa, Yamagata prefecture, Japan. His highest rank was ''sekiwake.'' He is now the head coach of Sadogatake stable. 
 
==Career==
At junior high school he practiced judo and shotput, and even represented his prefecture at the All Tohoku Shotput Championships.<Ref name="Sharnoff"></ref> He was already  tall by the age of 14. He was scouted into sumo by a supporter of Sadogatake stable.<Ref name="Sharnoff"/> He had intended to join in March 1984 alongside Kotonishiki, but failed the physical because of high blood pressure, delaying his entry by two months.<Ref name="Sharnoff"/> 

At first he wrestled under the name "Imano" and then "Kotoimano" before finally settling on "Kotonowaka" in 1988. It took him six years to achieve ''sekitori'' status by reaching the  the ''jūryō'' division in July 1990. He first reached ''makuuchi'' in November 1990 and remained continuously in the top division from March 1991. He advanced several times into the ''sanyaku'' ranks, first making ''komusubi'' in September 1993. However he had to wait until January 1999 to achieve his highest rank of ''sekiwake'', following a strong 10-5 showing at ''komusubi'' the previous November. 

Kotonowaka never won a tournament, but he nevertheless triumphed eight times against ''yokozuna''.  He also received five Fighting Spirit and two Outstanding Achievement prizes in the course of his long career, the first coming in July 1995, nearly five years after his top division debut. He was ranked in the top division for 89 consecutive tournaments, which is the fourth best in history, and he was one of only a handful of ''rikishi'' to win over 600 top division bouts.

Kotonowaka relied strongly on countering techniques against his opponents, and his bouts were often relatively long as compared to most other wrestlers. This proclivity led to him receiving the nickname "Mr. Ippun" ("Mr. One-Minute"). His speciality was ''uwatenage,'' or the overarm throw. 

His good looks meant he was popular with female sumo fans.<Ref name="Sharnoff"/>

==Retirement from sumo==
During the 2005 November tournament, in which, at 37, he was the oldest ''rikishi'' in his division, he announced his retirement. He took over immediately as stable master of Sadogatake stable, having already married the daughter of Sadogatake's former stablemaster, former Yokozuna, Kotozakura.<ref></ref>  He oversaw the promotion of Kotomitsuki to ''ozeki'' in July 2007, and Kotooshu's first top division championship in May 2008. The first wrestler from his stable to be promoted to the top division since he took over was Kotokasuga, also in May 2008.
