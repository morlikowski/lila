thumb|Falkirk Wheel beim gleichzeitigen Anheben und Absenken zweier Boote
Das '''Falkirk Wheel''' ist ein modernes Schiffshebewerk in Schottland, das durch seine Konstruktion in der Art eines Riesenrades einmalig auf der Welt ist.

Die zwei Gondeln sind in einem riesigen Rad angebracht. Durch eine halbe Drehung des Rades vertauschen die Fördertröge innerhalb von etwa vier Minuten ihre Position und können so Schiffe heben und senken. Das ''Falkirk Wheel'' überwindet einen Höhenunterschied von 35 Metern.
 
Die Gondeln haben je 300 t Masse. Aufgrund des archimedischen Prinzips verdrängen die Boote genau so viel Wasser, wie sie selbst wiegen, daher sind die beiden Gondeln immer im Gleichgewicht und zum Drehen ist nur eine geringe Kraft erforderlich. Beim Andocken der Gondel am oberen oder unteren Kanal werden zwei dicht schließende Schleusentore geöffnet, wodurch nur ein geringer Wasserverlust eintritt: Beim Abdocken braucht man nur diese kleine Menge Wasser zwischen den beiden nahe beisammen liegenden Toren abzupumpen.

Das Hebewerk ist Teil des "Clyde und Forth bildet. Es wurde im Mai Schleusen, die bei Falkirk den Forth and Clyde Canal mit dem Union Canal verbanden.

The '''Falkirk Wheel''', named after the nearby town of Union Canal. The difference in the levels of the two canals at the wheel is , roughly equivalent to the height of an eight storey<!-- British spelling; please do not change to 'story' --> building.  The structure is located near the Rough Castle Fort and the closest village is Tamfourhill. 
On Queen Elizabeth II opened the Falkirk Wheel as part of her Golden Jubilee celebrations. The opening had been delayed by a month due to flooding caused by vandals who forced open the Wheel's gates.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=541&id=1138932002 Wheel back on roll after vandalism repair work] news.scotsman.com, 14 October 2002, Retrieved 8 July 2006</ref>

==Design of the Falkirk Wheel==
Architectural services were supplied by Scotland-based RMJM, from initial designs by Nicoll Russell Studios and engineers Binnie Black and Veatch.<ref>[http://evolution.skf.com/zino.aspx?articleID=391&lan=en-gb Initial designs were by Nicoll Russell Studios]</ref>. 

Bachy/Soletanche and Morrison Construction Joint Venture won the contract to design the wheel and receiving basin, a new section of canal, a tunnel beneath the Antonine wall and a section of aqueduct. In turn the Joint Venture appointed Butterley Engineering to design and construct the wheel. Butterley undertook all construction work for the wheel and set up its own team to carry out the design work. This team comprised Tony Gee and Partners, to undertake the structural design responsibilities and M G Bennett & Associates to design the mechanical and electrical equipment for the wheel. 

The wheel, which has an overall diameter of , consists of two opposing arms which extend 15 metres beyond the central axle, and which take the shape of a Celtic-inspired, double-headed axe. Two sets of these axe-shaped arms are attached about  apart to a  diameter axle. Two diametrically opposed water-filled caissons, each with a capacity of , are fitted between the ends of the arms.

These caissons always weigh the same whether or not they are carrying their combined capacity of  of floating canal barges as, according to Archimedes' principle, floating objects displace their own weight in water, so when the boat enters, the amount of water leaving the caisson weighs exactly the same as the boat. This keeps the wheel balanced and so, despite its enormous mass, it rotates through 180° in five and a half minutes while using very little power. It takes just  to power the electric motors, which consume just  of energy in four minutes, roughly the same as boiling eight kettles of water.

The wheel is the only rotating boat lift of its kind in the world, and is regarded as an engineering landmark for Scotland. The United Kingdom has one other boat lift: the Anderton boat lift in Cheshire. The Falkirk Wheel is an improvement on the Anderton boat lift and makes use of the same original principle: two balanced tanks, one going up and the other going down, however, the rotational mechanism is entirely unique to the Falkirk Wheel.

==Construction of the wheel==
The wheel was constructed by Ripley in locks, but by the 1930s these had fallen into disuse, were filled in and the land built upon.

==Operation==
===How the wheel rotates===

The wheel rotates together with the axle, which is supported by four-metre-diameter piled foundations.

The slewing bearing at the machine-room end of the axle has an inner ring gear which is configured to act as a rotating ring gear. An electric motor drives a hydraulic pump which is connected to the hydraulic motors by means of hoses and drive the wheel at 1/8 revolution per minute.

===How the caissons are kept level===

The caissons need to rotate at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction to keep them level and to ensure that the load of boats and water does not tip out when the wheel turns.

Each end of each caisson is supported on small wheels which run on the inside face of the eight-metre-diameter holes at the ends of the arms, allowing the caissons to rotate.  The rotation is controlled by means of a train of gears: an alternating pattern of three eight-metre-diameter ring gears and two smaller idler gears, all with external teeth.  The central large gear acts as a stationary ''sun gear''.  It is fitted loosely over the axle at its machine-room end and fixed to a plinth to prevent it from rotating.  The two, smaller, idler gears are fixed to each of the arms of the wheel at its machine-room end and act as ''planet gears''.  When the motors rotate the wheel, the arms swing and the planet gears engage the sun gear, which results in the planet gears rotating at a higher speed than the wheel but in the same direction.  The planet gears engage the large ring gears at the end of the caissons, driving them at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction.  This cancels the rotation due to the arms and keeps the caissons stable and perfectly level.

===The docking-pit===

The docking-pit is a drydock-like port which is isolated from the lower canal basin by means of watertight gates and kept dry by means of water pumps. When the wheel rotates and stops with its arms in the vertical position it is possible for boats to enter and exit the lower caisson when the gates are open without flooding the docking-pit. The space below the caisson is empty.

If it were not for inclusion of the docking-pit the caissons and extremities of the arms of the wheel would be immersed in water at the lower canal basin each time the wheel rotates. This would result in a number of undesirable situations developing, such as providing buoyancy to the bottom caisson and the viscosity of the water causing an increase in the required power.

===How the canal was routed through the wheel===
The route chosen to take the Union Canal to the site of the wheel involved building a completely new section of canal, leading from the original terminus at Port Maxwell to link up with a new basin to the south of the wheel.
