== Plot ==

The movie revolves around a brother and sister, Darry and Trish, returning home from college during a spring holiday break. Their journey is uneventful, and they spend the time speaking about their parents and college life, until they are terrorized by someone in an old truck, and later see the driver unloading what looks like bodies into a hole as they drive past. 

After escaping, Darry insists they go back. Darry orders Trish to hold his feet while he looks in the hole. Rats appear in front of him and he freaks out and falls into the hole. Once in the hole, he finds hundreds of bodies sewn together, covering the walls of a massive cavern. They then stop at a gas station, where they contact the police, and are called by a local psychic who warns them about what they are up against. She plays them the song Jeepers Creepers through the phone, and tells them that when they hear that song, they will be in extreme danger. Badly frightened, they take no notice of her.  The police follow them as escort to protect them from the potential vengeful killer. 

As they travel the police are attacked by the truck driver, and one of them is decapitated. Darry and Trish watch as the man picks up the head and eats the tongue out of it. As they escape he loads the bodies into his truck (while whistling the tune of 'Jeepers Creepers' played by Cody Sharp) and resumes the chase. Darry and Trish try to get help from a local eccentric, but the killer catches up and kills her. They manage to hit the creature with their car, and run him over several times. After crushing the body they realize its inhuman nature as one of the creatures, heretofore unseen, wings begins flapping around. They drive to a police station but the psychic shows up and warns them they are not safe.
  
The creature, nicknamed the 'Creeper', feeds for a reason: the body parts it eats are used to replace its own body parts, whether they become injured, or are simply inferior to the newly selected organs. After it feasts on prisoners, it is swarmed by police, but it kills  a number of them easily. The psychic guides them upstairs telling them one of them will die, screaming in the dark while the song Jeepers Creepers plays in the background. The creature catches up and captures Darry. Trish tries to reason with it, and tries to give her life for her brother's, but the Creeper refuses and escapes out the window with Darry. The next day while Trish contemplates her brother's fate, miles away in an abandoned boiler room the Creeper kills Darry by removing the back of his head and takes his eyes. The last thing seen is the Creeper looking through the holes of Darry's eyeless corpse in his new underground home.
