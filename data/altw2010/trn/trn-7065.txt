The '''prince de Condé''' (named after Condé-en-Brie, now in the Aisne ''département'') is a historical French title, originally assumed circa 1557 by the French Protestant leader, Louis of Bourbon (1530-1569), <ref></ref> uncle of King Henry IV of France, and borne by his male line descendants. 

As a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, which was the ruling house of France from 1589 till 1793, the princes de Condé played an important role in the politics and society of the kingdom until their extinction in 1830. 

The family were ''princes du sang'', and came to be addressed as ''altesse sérénissime'' (Most Serene Highness). As the nearest heirs to the throne outside the immediate royal family (''famille du roi''), the head of the Condé branch was known at court as ''Monsieur le prince'', until 1723, when the right to that style passed to a more senior ''prince du sang'' of the House of Orléans. 

==History==
thumb|390px|right|The [[House of Bourbon family tree.]] The princes de Condé descend from the '''Vendôme''' family - the fathers of the modern Charles IV de Bourbon, duc de Vendôme (1489-1537), the Champagne, consisting of the Château of Condé and a dozen villages some fifty miles east of Paris. 

It had passed from the St. Pol. When Marie de Luxembourg-St. Pol wed François, Count of Vendôme (1470-1495) in 1487, Condé-en-Brie became part of the Bourbon-Vendôme patrimony. 

===duc de Bourbon===

After the extinction in 1527 of the Dukes of Bourbon, François's son Charles (1489-1537) became head of the Louis IX. Of the sons of Charles of Vendôme, the eldest, Antoine, became King-consort of Navarre and fathered Henry IV. 

The youngest son, Louis inherited the lordships of Blood Royal, they continued to bear it for the next three centuries. 

Louis, the first Prince, actually gave the Condé property to his youngest son, Charles (1566-1612), Count of Soissons. Charles' only son Louis (1604-1641) left Condé and Soissons to female heirs in 1624, who married into the Orléans-Longueville dynasties. 

===Monsieur le Prince===

Upon the accession to France's throne of Henry IV de Bourbon in 1589, his first cousin-once-removed Henry, Prince of Condé (1588&ndash;1646), was dauphin, fils de France, and petits-fils de France, from 1589 to 1709 the Princes of Condé coincidentally held the rank at court of ''premier prince du sang royal'' (First Prince of the Blood Royal), to which was attached income, precedence, and ceremonial privilege (such as the exclusive right to be addressed as ''Monsieur le prince'' at court). 

However, the position of ''premier prince'' devolved upon the Dukes of Orléans in 1710, so the seventh Prince, Louis III (1668&ndash;1710) declined to make use of the title, preferring instead to be known by his hereditary peerage of Duke of Bourbon, which still afforded him the right to be known as ''Monsieur le duc''. Subsequent heirs likewise preferred the ducal to the princely title. 

===Later===

After the death of Henry III Jules de Bourbon, prince de Condé in 1709, the family were in regular attendance at court, and later Louis III, Prince of Condé was married to Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, the legitimated daughter of Louis XIV and his ''maîtresse-en-titre'' Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan.

The couple had many children and produced an heir to the Condé titles and lands. Their son was Louis Henri, duc de Bourbon. He led a quiet life and was known at court as Monsieur le duc after the loss of the rank of ''premier prince du sang'' in 1723. After his death the family retreated from court life but Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé was vital in the forming of the Army of Condé - formed to support his cousin Louis XVI during his imprisonment during the revolution. He was the longest holder of the title, being known as the prince de Condé for seventy-eight years.

His son married the sister of Louis Philippe II d'Orléans better known as '''Philippe Égalité'''. She was called Louise Marie Thérèse Bathilde d'Orléans. She was the last princesse de Condé and mother of duc d'Enghien, the heir to the Condé name, his father was the last holder of the title.

After his death in Henri Eugène Philippe Louis d'Orléans, duc d'Aumale .

The ''House of Bourbon-Conti'' was formed in 1581 by François de Bourbon, prince de Conti. He was the son of Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Condé. The house became extinct in 1817 upon the death of Louis François II de Bourbon, prince de Conti. 
The princes de Conti were:

* 1558-1614: marquis, from 1581 1st Prince of Conti

''At his death, the title became extinct because the prince died without issue. The title was assumed in 1629 by:''

* Armand de Bourbon 
* Louis Armand I de Bourbon 
* Francis Louis de Bourbon 
* Louis Armand II de Bourbon 
* Louis Francis I de Bourbon  
* Louis Francis II de Bourbon  

===House of Bourbon-Soissons===
thumb|right|150px|The arms of the house of Savoy-Carignan-Soissons
The first prince de Conti was also the brother of the founder of the ''House of Bourbon-Soissons'', Charles de Bourbon-Soissons. The comtes de Soissons were addressed at court as ''Monsieur le Comte'' and their wives as ''Madame la Comtesse''. The members of the house were:

* François de Bourbon-Vendôme (1470-1495);
* 1495-Charles de Bourbon-Vendôme (1489-1537), comte (jure matris), son of the preceding;
* 1547-1557 : '''Jean de Bourbon-Soissons''' (1528-1557), son of the preceding; 
* 1557-1569 : '''Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Condé''' (1535-1569), brother of the preceding;
* 1569-1612 : '''Charles de Bourbon, comte de Soissons''' (1566-1612), son of the preceding; 
* 1612-1641 : '''Louis de Bourbon, comte de Soissons''' (1604-1641), son of the preceding;
* 1641-1656 : '''Marie de Bourbon-Soissons''' (1606-1692), sister of the preceding.

The line started in Charles de Bourbon-Condé, the second son of Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Condé, the first ''Prince of Condé''.The Soissons title had been acquired by the first Prince of Condé in 1557 and was held by his descendents for two more generations:

* 1. Charles de Bourbon-Condé, 1st comte de Soissons
* 2. Louis de Bourbon-Condé, 2nd comte de Soissons

The 2nd comte de Soissons died without an heir, so the Soissons estates passed to his younger sister, '''Marie de Bourbon-Condé''', the wife of Thomas Francois of Savoy, prince de Carignan, a younger brother of the sovereign Saint-Simon, she "maintained the traditions of the Soissons", she continued to be known as the princesse de Carignan.<ref></ref> On her death, the Soissons countship passed first to her second son, '''Prince Joseph-Emmanuel of Savoy-Carignan''' (1631-1656), and then to her third son, Prince Eugène-Maurice of Savoy-Carignan. He married Olympia Mancini, niece of Cardinal Mazarin. She was known as ''Madame la Comtesse de Soissons''<ref>Nancy Mitford, ''The Sun King'', 1966, p.87</ref>. On his death, the title went to his eldest son, Prince Louis Thomas of Savoy-Carignan, who was the older brother of the famous Austrian general, Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Soissons countship became extinct upon the death of '''Prince Eugène-Jean-François of Savoy-Carignan''' in 1734.

The Conti Line ended in 1814 with the death of Louis François II de Bourbon, prince de Conti, the last Prince de Conti. The Soissons line ended in 1734 at the death of '''Prince Eugène of Savoy-Carignan'''.
