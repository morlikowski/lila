'''Plastic surgery''' is a medical specialty interested in the correction of form and function. While famous for aesthetic surgery, plastic surgery also includes a variety of fields: craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, burn surgery, microsurgery, and pediatric surgery. The word "plastic" derives from the Greek ''plastikos'' meaning to mold or to shape; its use here is not connected with the synthetic polymer material known as plastic. 

==History==
Plastic surgery reaches back to the 700s BCE. Physicians in ancient India including Sushruta were making use of skin grafts for reconstructive work as early as the 8th century BC. In his work Sushruta Samhita describes rhinoplasty and otoplasty. This knowledge of plastic surgery existed in India up to the late 18th century as can be seen from the reports published in ''Gentleman's Magazine'' (October 1794).<!--

The Romans were able to perform simple techniques such as repairing damaged ears from around the 1st century BC. Due to religious reasons they didn't approve of the dissection of both human beings and animals, thus their knowledge was based in its entirety on the texts of their Greek predecessors. Notwithstanding this Aulus Cornelius Celsus has left some surprisingly accurate anatomical descriptions, some of which —for instance, his studies on the genitalia and the skeleton— are of special interest to plastic surgery.<ref>P. Santoni-Rugiu, ''A History of Plastic Surgery'' (2007)</ref>

In 1465, Sabuncuoglu's book, description, and classification of hypospadias was more informative and up to date. Localization of urethral meatus was described in detail. Sabuncuoglu also detailed the description and classification of ambiguous genitalia (Kitabul Cerrahiye-i Ilhaniye -Cerrahname-Tip Tarihi Enstitüsü, Istanbul) In mid-15th century Europe, Heinrich von Pfolspeundt described a process "to make a new nose for one who lacks it entirely, and the dogs have devoured it" by removing skin from the back of the arm and suturing it in place. However, because of the dangers associated with surgery in any form, especially that involving the head or face, it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries that such surgery became commonplace.

Up until the techniques of anesthesia became established, all surgery on healthy tissues involved great pain. Infection from surgery was reduced once sterile technique and disinfectants were introduced. The invention and use of antibiotics beginning with sulfa drugs and penicillin was another step in making elective surgery possible.

In 1791, Chopart performed operative procedure on a lip using a flap from the neck. In 1814, Joseph Carpue  successfully performed operative procedure on a British military officer who had lost his nose to the toxic effects of mercury treatments. In 1818, German surgeon Carl Ferdinand von Graefe published his major work entitled ''Rhinoplastik''. Von Graefe modified the Italian method using a free skin graft from the arm instead of the original delayed pedicle flap. In 1845, Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach wrote a comprehensive text on rhinoplasty, entitled ''Operative Chirurgie'', and introduced the concept of reoperation to improve the cosmetic appearance of the reconstructed nose. In 1891, American otorhinolaryngologist John Roe presented an example of his work, a young woman on whom he reduced a dorsal nasal hump for cosmetic indications. In 1892, Robert Weir experimented unsuccessfully with xenografts (duck sternum) in the reconstruction of sunken noses. In 1896, James Israel, a urological surgeon from Germany, and In 1889 George Monks of the United States each described the successful use of heterogeneous free-bone grafting to reconstruct saddle nose defects. In 1898, Jacques Joseph, the German orthopaedic-trained surgeon, published his first account of reduction rhinoplasty. In 1928, Jacques Joseph published ''Nasenplastik und Sonstige Gesichtsplastik''.

The U.S.'s first plastic surgeon was Dr. John Peter Mettauer. In 1827, he performed the first cleft palate operation with instruments that he designed himself. The New Zealander Sir Harold Gillies, an otolaryngologist, developed many of the techniques of modern plastic surgery in caring for those who suffered facial injuries in RAF aircrew suffering from severe burns. McIndoe's radical, experimental treatments, lead to the formation of the Guinea Pig Club. Plastic surgery as a specialty evolved tremendously during the 20th Century in the United States. One of the founders of the specialty, Dr. Vilray Blair, was the first chief of the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. In one of his many areas of clinical expertise, Blair treated World War I soldiers with complex maxillofacial injuries, and his paper on “Reconstructive Surgery of the Face” set the standard for craniofacial reconstruction. He was also one of the first surgeons without a dental background to be elected to the American Association of Oral and Plastic Surgery (later the organizations split to be renamed the American Association of Plastic Surgeons and the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons) and taught many surgeons who became leaders in the field of plastic surgery[http://www.plasticsurgery.wustl.edu/Teaching/History.asp].

==Techniques and procedures==
Common techniques used in plastic surgery are:
*incision
*excision
*microsurgery
*chemosurgery
*electrosurgery
*laser surgery
*dermabrasion
*liposuction

In plastic surgery the transfer of skin tissue (skin grafting) is one of the most common procedures. (In traditional surgery a “graft” is a piece of living tissue, organ, etc., that is transplanted.
*Autografts: Skin grafts taken from the recipient. If absent or deficient of natural tissue, alternatives can be:
**Cultured Sheets of epithelial cells in vitro.
**Synthetic compounds (e.g., Integra--a 2 layered dermal substitute consisting superficially of silicone and deeply of bovine tendon collagen with glycosaminoglycans).
*Allografts: Skin grafts taken from a donor of the same species.
*Xenografts: Skin grafts taken from a donor of a different species.

Usually, good results are expected from plastic surgery that emphasizes:
*Careful planning of incisions so that they fall in the line of natural skin folds or lines.
*Appropriate choice of wound closure.
*Use of best available suture materials.
*Early removal of exposed sutures so that the wound is held closed by buried sutures.

==Reconstructive plastic surgery==
Reconstructive Plastic Surgery is performed to correct functional impairments caused by:
*burns
*traumatic injuries, such as facial bone fractures
*congenital abnormalities, such as cleft lip, or cleft palate
*developmental abnormalities
*infection or disease
*removal of cancers or tumors, such as a mastectomy for a breast cancer, a head and neck cancer and a abdominal invasion by a colon cancer

Reconstructive plastic surgery is usually performed to improve function, but it may be done to approximate a normal appearance. It is generally covered by insurance coverage but this may change according to the procedure required.

Common reconstructive surgical procedures are: burn survivors; <i>one of the complication of severe burns''.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling's_ulcer] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_ulcer]), creating a new outer ear when one is congenitally absent, and closing skin and mucosa defects after removal of tumors in the head and neck region.

Plastic surgeons developed the use of tissue flaps comprised of skin, muscle, bone, fat or a combination, may be removed from the body, moved to another site on the body and reconnected to a blood supply by suturing arteries and veins as small as 1-2 mm in diameter.

==Cosmetic surgery==
Cosmetic Surgery defined as a subspecialty of surgery that uniquely restricts itself to the enhancement of appearance through surgical and medical techniques. It is specifically concerned with maintaining normal appearance, restoring it, or enhancing it beyond the average level toward some aesthetic ideal. In 2006, nearly 11 million cosmetic surgeries were performed in the United States alone.<ref>[http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/22/132047.shtml 2006: Nearly 11 Million Cosmetic Surgeries in U.S.]. March 22, 2007.</ref>

It is important to distinguish the terms "plastic surgery" and "cosmetic surgery": Plastic Surgery is a recognized surgical specialty and is defined as the subspecialty dedicated to the surgical repair of defects of form or function -- this includes cosmetic (or aesthetic) surgery, as well as reconstructive surgery.  The term "cosmetic surgery" however, refers to surgery that is designed to improve cosmetics alone.  Many other surgical specialists are also required to learn certain cosmetic procedures during their training programs.  Contributing disciplines include dermatology, general surgery, plastic surgery, otolaryngology, maxillofacial surgery, and oculoplastic surgery.

The most prevalent aesthetic/cosmetic procedures are listed below. Most of these types of surgery are more commonly known by their "common names." These are also listed when pertinent.
* Abdominoplasty (or "tummy tuck"): reshaping and firming of the abdomen
* Blepharoplasty (or "eyelid surgery"): Reshaping of the eyelids or the application of permanent eyeliner, including Asian blepharoplasty
* Mammoplasty
** Breast augmentation (or "breast enlargement" or "boob job"): Augmentation of the breasts. This can involve either fat grafting, saline or silicone gel prosthetics. Initially performed to women with micromastia
** Breast reduction: Removal of skin and glandular tissue. Indicated to reduce back and shoulder pain in women with gigantomastia and/or for psychological benefit in women with gigantomastia/macromastia and men with gynecomastia.
** Breast lift (Mastopexy): Lifting or reshaping of breasts to make them less saggy, often after weight loss (after a pregnancy, for example). It involves removal of breast skin as opposed to glandular tissue.
* Buttock Augmentation (or "butt augmentation" or "butt implants"): Enhancement of the buttocks. This procedure can be performed by using silicone implants or fat grafting and transfer from other areas of the body.
* acne, pock, and other scars as well as photodamage in general. Chemical peels commonly involve carbolic acid (Phenol), trichloroacetic acid (TCA), glycolic acid (AHA), or salicylic acid (BHA) as the active agent.
* labia
* Rhinoplasty (or "nose job"): Reshaping of the nose
* Otoplasty (or ear surgery): Reshaping of the ear
* Rhytidectomy (or "face lift"): Removal of wrinkles and signs of aging from the face
* Suction-Assisted Lipectomy (or ''liposuction''): Removal of fat from the body
* Chin augmentation: Augmentation of the chin with an implant (e.g. silicone) or by sliding genioplasty of the jawbone.
* Cheek augmentation
* Collagen, fat, and other tissue filler injections (e.g. hyaluronic acid)
* Laser skin resurfacing
* Male Pectoral Implant : It is a procedure used to enhance chest size in men by inserting silicone implants under the chest muscle.

In recent years, a growing number of patients seeking cosmetic surgery have visited other countries to find doctors with lower costs.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/fyi/2007/1029/095_2.html "Patient travelers"], ''Forbes'', October 29, 2007</ref>  These medical tourists seek to get their procedures done for a cost savings in countries including Cuba, Thailand, Argentina, India, and some areas of eastern Europe.  The risk of complications and the lack of after surgery support are often overlooked by those simply looking for the cheapest option.

'''整容'''是透過外科臉部整型，包括割雙眼皮、墊下巴、隆鼻、嫩唇、造酒窩痘、種睫毛等。不少人以為矯形理解為整容，但兩者實屬不同。整容並非身體上的缺陷或傷殘，是當事人因自己個人喜好或其他非醫療上的原因，以外科手術改變自己的外觀，手術其實是沒有必要。矯形則是因為疾病、後天因素或意外導致永久的身體缺陷或傷殘，可透過以外科手術補救或矯正，而這類手術通常是有需要或必須的。

例如美國歌星迈克尔·杰克逊多年來不斷進行整容手術，外貌與膚色都和未整容之前完全不同。另外在亞洲，日本和韓國，整容是一件很平常的事，整容醫生也很多。整容以女性為主，但近年也多了男性整容。

==風險==
雖然整容愈來愈普遍，但危險性極高。香港和中國大陸早前便證實了隆乳物質PAAG可以致癌，有很多人都被逼把物料拿出來。迈克尔·杰克逊那曾經接受多次整容的鼻子也有崩坍的危險，他更曾經因此而受到生命威脅。

==五大整容國家==
*美國-90992宗(2002年)
*墨西哥-52956宗(2002年)
*巴西-47957宗(2002年)
*日本-42842宗(2002年)
*西班牙-40164宗(2002年)
