'''Irvine''' () is an incorporated city in Orange County, California,  United States. It is a planned city, mainly developed by the Irvine Company since the 1960s. Formally incorporated on December 28 1971, the 69.7 square mile (180.5&nbsp;km²) city has a population of 202,079 (as of 2007).  It has annexed in the past an undeveloped area to the north, and has also annexed the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, most of which is planned to be converted into the Orange County Great Park. Currently, Irvine is larger in land area than any other city in Orange County because of its annexation of the southern and eastern unincorporated areas. In June 2008, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that Irvine had the lowest violent crime rate (four homicides, 17 rapes, 50 robberies and 55 aggravated assaults in 2006) among cities in the United States with populations of more than 100,000. <ref name=test>[http://www.knbc.com/news/13441147/detail.html?rss=la&psp=news]</ref>

Irvine is home to the Concordia University, the Orange County Center of the University of Southern California, and the Irvine campuses of Alliant International University, California State University Fullerton, and Pepperdine University. Irvine Valley College, a community college, is also located in the city.

Irvine is home to a number of corporations, particularly in the technology sector.

==History==

Irvine was inhabited by the missions and herds of cattle. The King of Spain parceled out land for missions and private use. 

After Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government secularized the missions and assumed control of the lands. It began distributing the land to Mexican citizens who applied for grants. Three large Spanish/Mexican grants made up the land that later became the Irvine Ranch: Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, Rancho San Joaquin and Rancho Lomas de Santiago.

In 1864, Jose Sepulveda, owner of Rancho San Joaquin sold  to Benjamin and Thomas Flint, Llewellyn Bixby and James Irvine for $18,000 to resolve debts due to the Great Drought. In 1866, Irvine, Flint and Bixby acquired  Rancho Lomas de Santiago for $7,000. After the Mexican-American war the land of Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana fell prey to tangled titles. In 1868, the ranch was divided among four claimants as part of a lawsuit: Flint, Bixby and Irvine. The ranches were devoted to sheep grazing. However, in 1870, tenant farming was permitted.

In 1878, James Irvine, Jr. who incorporated it into The Irvine Company. James, Jr. shifted the ranch operations to field crops, olive and citrus crops.

In 1888, the Santa Fe Railroad extended its line to Fallbrook Junction (north of San Diego) and named a station along the way after James Irvine. The town that formed around this station was named Myford, after Irvine's son, because a post office in Calaveras County already bore the family name. The town was later renamed Irvine, however, in 1914.[http://books.google.com/books?id=Kqwt5RlMVBoC&pg=PA179&vq=fallbrook+junction&dq=kathryn+irvine&sig=T3wJAZtrZYiEDYCTB8IIZyypiZM]

By 1918,  of MCAS El Toro and MCAS Tustin, were built during World War II on ranch land sold to the government.

James Irvine, Jr. died in 1947 at the age of 80. His son, Myford, assumed the presidency of The Irvine Company. He began opening small sections of the Irvine Ranch to urban development. Myford died in 1959. The same year, the State purchased an additional 500 acres (2&nbsp;km²). 

William Pereira, the University's consulting architect, and The Irvine Company planners drew up master plans for a city of 50,000 people surrounding the new university. The plan called for industrial, residential and recreational areas, commercial centers and greenbelts. The new community was to be named Irvine; the old agricultural town of Irvine, where the railroad station and post office were located, was renamed East Irvine.[http://books.google.com/books?id=Kqwt5RlMVBoC&pg=PA179&vq=fallbrook+junction&dq=kathryn+irvine&sig=T3wJAZtrZYiEDYCTB8IIZyypiZM] The villages of Turtle Rock, University Park, Culverdale, the Ranch and Walnut were completed by 1970.

On December 28, 1971, the residents of these communities voted to incorporate a substantially larger city than the one envisioned by the Pereira plan. By January 1999, Irvine had a population of 134,000 and a total area of .

== A planned city == 
The layout of Irvine was designed by Los Angeles architect William Pereira and Irvine Company employee Raymond Watson, and is nominally divided into townships called ''villages''.  The townships are separated by six-lane streets. Each township contains houses of similar design, along with commercial centers, religious institutions and schools.  Commercial districts are checker-boarded in a periphery around the central townships.

Pereira originally envisioned an southern coastal hills. The design that ended up being used was based on the shape of a necklace (with the villages strung along two parallel main streets, which terminate at UCI, the "pendant") . Traces of the original circular design are visible in the layout of the UCI campus and the two man-made lakes at the center of Woodbridge, one of the central villages.

All streets have landscaping allowances.  Rights-of-way for powerlines also serve as bicycle corridors, parks and greenbelts to tie together ecological preserves.  The greenery is irrigated with reclaimed water.  

The homeowners' associations which govern some village neighborhoods exercise varying degrees of control on the appearances of homes.  In more restrictive areas, houses' roofing, paint colors, and landscaping are regulated.  A notable exception is the Village of Northwood, which was developed beginning in the early 1970s independent of the Irvine Company, and thus has the distinction of being a larger village that is not under the purview of a homeowners' association.  As a result, homeowners in Northwood do not pay a monthly village association fee; and its neighborhoods are generally not as uniform in appearance as those in other villages such as West Park and Woodbridge, the latter which, however, generally offer more amenities such as members-only swimming pools, tennis courts, and parks.  

In addition to association dues, homeowners in villages developed in the 1980s and later may be levied a Mello-Roos assessment, which came about in the post-Proposition 13 era.  For homeowners in these areas, the association dues coupled with the Mello-Roos assessment may add significantly to the cost of living in the city.

The Irvine Ranch played host to the Boy Scouts of America's 1953 National Scout Jamboree. Jamboree Road, a major street which now stretches from Newport Beach to the City of Orange, was named in honor of this event.

Each of the villages was initially planned to have a distinct architectural theme, though many have been clouded by later development.
