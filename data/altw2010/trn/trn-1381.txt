'''Black Flag''' – amerykański zespół grający Grega Ginna, wokalistę Keitha Morrisa i perkusistę Davida Horvitza. Początkowo posługiwali się nazwą '''Panic''' i grali bez gitarzysty basowego, co miało ogromny wpływ na późniejsze mocne brzmienie zespołu gdyż Ginn grał na bardzo nisko nastrojonej gitarze. Trochę później na próbach zespół wspomagali jako basiści: brat Ginna Raymond Pettibon (właśc. Raymond Ginn), albo Spot – który został później producentem muzycznym.
W końcu na jednej z prób zjawili się: basista Kalifornii. Później okazało się, że istnieje już zespół o tej samej nazwie, więc aby uniknąć nieporozumień muzycy zmienili ją w 1978 roku na '''Black Flag'''. W tym czasie Midgola na perkusji zastąpił ROBO.

Już z nową nazwą zadebiutowali 27 stycznia 1979 również w Redondo Beach. To był występ na którym po raz pierwszy zobaczył ich Dez Cadena.

Nowa nazwa została podsunięta przez Raymonda Pettibona, który również zaprojektował logo dla zespołu: cztery czarne prostokąty. Muzycy malowali je po całym Los Angeles, zyskując sobie w ten sposób rozgłos i fanów, ale i tym samym narazili się władzom i policji. Pettibon tworzył później dla zespołu okładki na płyty i single. 
W tym czasie w południowej Kalifornii było niewiele okazji, na których zespoły punkrockowe mogły zaprezentować się publicznie. Black Flag sami organizowali sobie koncerty dogadując się z właścicielami klubów. Sami również kolportowali ulotki informacyjne o nich (Dukowski później wspominał, że sam chodził z min. 500 ulotkami).

Chociaż Ginn był liderem zespołu, to duży wkład w Black Flag miał Dukowski. Ginn pomimo tego, że narzucał dyscyplinę – był człowiekiem spokojnego usposobienia, natomiast żywiołowy i błyskotliwy Dukowski robił często za rzecznika Black Flag w kontakcie z mediami.

Po odejściu Morrisa (utworzył wkrótce zespół Chavo Pederast (właśc. Ron Reyes), który był ich fanem. Śpiewał w zespole kilka miesięcy i został zastąpiony przez innego fana – wspomnianego już wcześniej Deza Cadenę. Po dołączeniu Cadeny do Black Flag zwiększyła się aktywność koncertowa zespołu (przed koncertem w Civic Auditorium w Santa Monica sprzedano 3500 biletów-nigdy więcej taka sytuacja nie powtórzyła się). W pierwszej połowie 1981 roku Cadena zaczął mieć problemy ze strunami głosowymi. Poważnie je nadwyrężył podczas tras koncertowych i musiał przerwać śpiewanie.

W tym czasie dwudziestoletni fan Black Flag Nowym Jorku, kiedy oni grali trasę po wschodnim wybrzeżu. Po improwizowanym występie w barze, na którym wraz z Black Flag wykonał utwór ''Clocked In'' dostał propozycję stałej współpracy. Zgodził się za namową Iana MacKaye'a (wokalisty Minor Threat). Dez Cadena po tym fakcie przerzucił się na gitarę i obok Grega Ginna stał się drugim gitarzystą w zespole.

Rollins był najdłużej wokalistą Black Flag. Kiedy dołączył do nich wniósł świeżość i optymizm. Umięśniony i wytatuowany skupiał uwagę na sobie. Śpiewał bardzo dynamicznie i zasłynął z powodu częstych walk na pięści z kimś z widowni podczas koncertów. Z nim zespół nagrał swój debiutancki album ''Damaged'' wydany przez stworzoną wcześniej przez Grega Ginna firmę SST Records. Po nagraniu płyty Cadena opuścił Black Flag i utworzył zespół DC3 (jeszcze na moment pojawił się w zespole w 1983 roku).

Pod koniec Europie, Publiczność przyjmowała ich dobrze, choć zdarzały się incydenty na koncertach z agresywnymi Richarda Hella. W Wielkiej Brytanii ROBO został zatrzymany w związku z problemem z wizą. Już nie powrócił do zespołu. Został zastąpiony przez Billa Stevensona (z zespołu Descendents). W 1982 roku ukazał się dwupłytowy album składankowy ''Everything Went Black'', zawierający nagrania z lat 1978-1981 (m.in. z singli jak również wczesne wersje utworów, które później trafiły na ''Damaged'').

Pod koniec 1983 roku z grania w Black Flag zrezygnował Dukowski. Ginn twierdzi, że lubił Dukowskiego i nigdy nic do niego nie miał, ale w jego grze było brak postępu. Dukowski po zaprzestaniu grania został ich tour menedżerem. Na jego miejsce do zespołu dołączyła Kira Roessler, ale zanim tak się stało to w niektórych nagraniach zespołu partie basowe zagrał Ginn (utwory z płyty ''My War''). Roessler do swojej gry podchodziła bardzo ambitnie i była chyba najlepszym basistą jaki przytrafił się zespołowi od samego początku. Z Roessler w składzie Black Flag zaczął eksperymentować z muzyką, czasami narażając się na ostrą krytykę dziennikarzy, a nawet i fanów.

W grunge'u ''My War'' zostało uznane za album, który miał ogromny wpływ na artystów z tego kręgu. W ciągu całego 1984 roku zespół zagrał 178 koncertów. Jeden z nich, który odbył się 26 sierpnia w klubie "The Stone" w San Francisco został nagrany i wydany na płycie pt. ''Live '84''.

W maju 1985 Stevensona zastąpił Anthony Martinez, ale jeszcze ze Stevensonem zespół nagrał dwie studyjne płyty: ''Loose Nut'' i ''In My Head''. Obie ukazały się w 1985. W styczniu 1986 z zespołu wyrzucono Kirę Roessler. Brak Roessler i Stevensona (zastąpili ich C'el Revuelta i Martinez) odbił się mocno na jakości koncertów, które wypadały słabo.

Black Flag zagrał swój ostatni koncert 27 czerwca 1986 roku w Detroit. Ginn miał już dosyć zespołu, który przynosił same straty, obaj z Rollinsem żyli na granicy ubóstwa. Jak to opisuje w swoich wspomnieniach Rollins: Ginn po prostu zadzwonił do niego i powiedział, że odchodzi.

Po rozpadzie Black Flag Rollins zajął się swoją karierą solową. Ginn udzielał się w zespołach: Gone, October Faction i Radio Screw.

'''Black Flag''' was a hardcore punk band formed in 1977 in southern California, largely as the brainchild of Greg Ginn: the guitarist, primary songwriter and sole continuous member through multiple personnel changes. They are widely considered the first hardcore punk band.

Black Flag forged a unique sound early on that mixed the raw simplicity of the atonal and microtonal guitar solos and frequent tempo shifts. Over this could be heard lyrics&mdash;mostly written by Ginn&mdash;about isolation, neurosis, poverty, and paranoia, themes which did not disappear when Henry Rollins took on the role of lead singer in 1981. Most of the band's material was released on Ginn's independent label, SST Records.

Black Flag was (and remains) well respected among their underground culture, with their influence primarily in their tireless promotion of a self-controlled DIY ethic and aesthetic. They're often regarded as pioneers in the movement of underground do-it-yourself record labels that flourished among the 1980s punk rock bands. Through seemingly constant touring throughout the United States and Canada, and occasionally Europe, Black Flag established an extremely dedicated fan base. Many other musicians would follow Black Flag's lead and book their own tours, utilizing a word-of-mouth network.

Over the course of the 1980s, Black Flag's sound, as well as their notoriety, evolved in ways that alienated much of their early punk audience. As well as being central to the creation of hardcore, they were part of the first wave of American West Coast punk subculture. Along with being among the earliest punk rock groups to incorporate elements and the influence of three-chord format. As a result, Black Flag's extensive discography is more varied than many of their punk-rock contemporaries.

==History==
===Early years===
Initially called '''Panic''', Black Flag formed in 1977. Ginn insisted that the band rehearse several hours a day.<ref name=guitarworld>Grad, David. "Fade to Black." ''Spin''. July 1997</ref> This work ethic proved too challenging for some early members; Ginn and singer Spot filled in sometimes at rehearsals.

Wurm, took a liking to Ginn's group, and eventually joined, forming a committed quartet with Ginn, Morris and drummer Brian Migdol. The band played their first performance in December 1977 in Redondo Beach, California. To avoid confusion with another band called Panic, they took on the name '''Black Flag''' in late 1978.<ref name=guitarworld/> They played their first show as 'Black Flag' on January 27, 1979, in Redondo Beach. This was the first time Dez Cadena saw the band.

The name was suggested by Ginn's brother, artist anarchist symbol, the insect spray of the same name, and of the British heavy metal group Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991''. Little Brown and Company, 2001. ISBN 0-316-78753-1, p. 19.</ref> The band spray painted the simple, striking logo all over Los Angeles, gaining attention from potential supporters, and thoroughly irritating police. Pettibon also created much of their cover artwork.

There were few opportunities for punk rock bands to perform in Southern California, (Los Angeles club The Masque was the center of the L.A. punk scene, but was also rather provincial, and didn't often admit bands from outside L.A. proper). Black Flag organized their own gigs, performing at picnics, house parties, schools, any place that was available. They called club owners themselves to arrange appearances, and plastered hundreds of flyers&mdash;usually Pettibon's severe, haunting comic strip style panels&mdash;on any available surface to publicize performances. Dukowski reported that the "minimum (number of flyers) that went out was 500 for a show."<ref></ref>

Though Ginn was the band's leader, special note should be made of Dukowski's contributions to Black Flag. Ginn was tireless and profoundly disciplined, but he was also rather quiet. Dukowski's intelligent, fast-talking, high-energy persona attracted significant attention, and he was often Black Flag's spokesman to the press. Dukowski acted as the group's tour manager even after he no longer performed with them, and he was probably as important as Ginn in establishing the group's DIY aesthetic and demanding work ethic. Dukowski's bass guitar was a vital part of the early Black Flag sound; "TV Party", for instance, was one of many songs "driven more by Chuck Dukowski's percolating bass line than Ginn's stun-gun guitar."<ref></ref>

Morris appeared as vocalist on Black Flag's earliest recordings, and his energized, manic stage presence helped the band earn a reputation in the Los Angeles area. Migdol was replaced by the enigmatic Columbian drummer Roberto Valverde (a.k.a. ROBO), whose numerous clicking metallic bracelets became part of his drum sound. The group played with a speed and ferocity that was all but unprecedented in rock music; critic Ira Robbins declared that "Black Flag was, for all intents and purposes, America's first hardcore band."<ref name="trouser"></ref> Morris quit in 1979, citing, among other reasons, creative differences with Ginn, and his own "freaking out on cocaine and speed."<ref></ref> Morris would subsequently form the Circle Jerks. 

After Morris's departure, Black Flag recruited fan Ron Reyes as singer. With Reyes, Black Flag recorded the ''Jealous Again'' 12-inch EP and appeared ''Decline Of Western Civilization'' movie. This was also the lineup that toured up and down the West Coast for the first time, the version most fans outside of LA first saw. 

In 1980, Reyes quit Black Flag mid-performance at the Redondo Beach venue "The Fleetwood" because of escalating violence. For the remainder of that gig, the group played an extended version of "Louie Louie" and invited audience members to take turns singing.<ref name=guitarworld /> In retaliation for his quitting mid-gig, the band credited Reyes as "Chavo Pederast," implying he was sexually attracted to younger boys.

The more reliable Dez Cadena - another fan - then joined as singer. With Cadena onboard, Black Flag began national touring in earnest, and arguably saw two peaks: first as a commercial draw (they sold out the 3,500-seat Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, a feat they were never able to manage again); and second, perhaps seeing the peak of attention from police in the Los Angeles area, due to the violence associated with Black Flag and punk rock in general. The band members have often insisted, however, that the police instigated far more problems than they solved.

By the summer of 1981, however, Cadena's voice was worn. He had no formal training or previous experience as a singer, and had severely strained his voice during Black Flag's seemingly nonstop touring, and he wanted to play guitar rather than sing.

===Rollins joins===
Twenty-year-old fan Henry Rollins (birth name Henry Garfield) &mdash; then living in Washington D.C. and singing for hardcore band S.O.A. &mdash; had corresponded with the band, and met them when they performed on the U.S. east coast. At an impromptu show in a bar, he asked to sing "Clocked In." Since vocalist Dez Cadena was switching to guitar, the band invited Rollins to a rehearsal. Impressed by his stage demeanor, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. He accepted, despite some doubts, due in part to Ian MacKaye's encouragement. Rollins acted as roadie for the remainder of the tour while learning Black Flag's songs during sound checks and encores, while Cadena crafted guitar parts that meshed with Ginn's. Rollins also impressed Black Flag with his broad musical interests during an era when punk rock music and fans were increasingly factionalized; he introduced Black Flag to Washington DC's go go, a distinctive take on funk music. 

Rollins was Black Flag's longest-lasting singer, and has remained active in music to the present. When he joined Black Flag, he brought a different attitude and perspective than previous singers. Some earlier songs, such as  "Six Pack" (a song written about ex-singer Keith Morris) blended a nearly goofy sense of satirical criticism (of apathy and alcoholism, respectively) with driving punk rock. He was a dynamic live performer and powerful singer, who usually appeared onstage wearing only shorts. Ginn once stated that after Rollins joined, "We couldn't do songs with a sense of humor anymore; he got into the serious way-out poet thing."<ref></ref>

With Rollins on board, Black Flag began work on their first full length album. The sessions for the record (chronicled in Spot, who had worked with the band and the Damaged'' tracks with Dez Cadena on vocals (as well as Keith Morris and Ron Reyes) and felt that the band's sound was ruined with the two guitar line-up (these versions can be heard on the albums ''Damaged'' recordings are more akin to a live recording, with little stereo separation of guitars, and somewhat muddy. When asked about the lo-fidelity production, SPOT has said "They *wanted* it to sound that way." However, the artistic content and expression on the album showed the band pushing punk or hardcore music to a new level, with deeply personal and intensely emotional lyrics. As such, ''Damaged'' is generally regarded as Black Flag's most focused recording. One critic has written that ''Damaged'' was "perhaps the best album to emerge from the quagmire that was early-'80s California punk ... the visceral, intensely physical presence of ''Damaged'' has yet to be equaled, although many bands have tried."<ref></ref> ''Damaged'' was released in the fall of 1981, and the group began an extensive tour in support of it, forging an independent network for touring independent music acts that would form a cornerstone of the independent music scene for the decade to come. 

The previous year Damaged'' and their growing reputation as an impressive live band, Black Flag seemed poised on the cusp of a commercial breakthrough. The record was to be distributed by now-defunct Unicorn Records, a subsidiary of MCA. Trouble began when MCA refused to handle ''Damaged'' after MCA executive Al Bergamo determined the album was an "Anti-Parent" record.<ref></ref> However, according to longtime SST employee Damaged''; Carducci reported that Unicorn Records was so poorly managed and so deeply in debt that MCA stood to lose money by distributing the record, regardless of its content. This was the beginning of a legal dispute that would, for a period a few years later, disallow Black Flag from using their own name on any record when Black Flag released ''Damaged'' on SST Records and placed a copy of the "Anti-Parent" statement on the record's cover. 

With their new singer, Black Flag and The Minutemen made their first tour of Europe in the Winter of 1981. During that tour, the band met punk icon Richard Hell and opened a concert for him. Rollins later published his diaries from that tour in his book ''Get In The Van''. As the front man, Rollins was a frequent target of violent audience members, and became known for fist-fights with audience members. Rollins developed a distinct showmanship on stage, where he could entertain an audience just by talking to them. 

As the band was about to return home from the European tour, UK customs detained Colombian drummer Robo due to visa problems, and he was not allowed back into the country. This would be the end of his tenure with the band (he eventually was able to get back into the United States and in 1983 would join The Misfits as their drummer). The loss of Robo temporarily put an end to extensive touring for a while. Emil Johnson of the Twisted Roots filled in for one tour, but it was clear he was only temporary. 

While on that tour in Vancouver, the band found out that drummer 1982 Demos'', showing the direction the band would go in for the ''My War'' LP. 

However, due to personality conflicts -- In ''Get In The Van'',, Rollins described Biscuits as a "fuck up" -- and the Unicorn court injunction-forced inactivity of Black Flag, Biscuits left to join their rivals The Circle Jerks. (Later, Biscuits joined ex-Misfits singer Glenn Danzig's solo project Danzig). Black Flag eventually got Bill Stevenson of The Descendents to join permanently (he had filled in from time-to-time before). While the Unicorn Records court injunction prevented the group from releasing a new studio album, they nonetheless continued to work on new material, and embarked on a period which would mark a pronounced change in the group's direction (and that of underground music in general). 

Perhaps the violence of the previous tour had an effect on the band's direction. The group had also become increasingly interested in music other than punk rock, such as The 1982 Demos'' bootleg) was slower and less like typical punk music, with classic rock and blues influences seeping in.  Cadena left to form his own band DC3. He would take some of the new songs he had written for Black Flag with him and record them for DC3's first album. 

Additionally, by late 1983, Dukowski had retired from performing with Black Flag (some accounts report he was "edged out" by Ginn<ref></ref>); Azerrad reports that Ginn was dissatisfied with Dukowski's failure to progress as an instrumentalist, and made things difficult for Dukowski in an attempt to make him quit, but in the end, Rollins took it on himself to fire Dukowski.<ref>Azerrad, 41.</ref> However, a few of Dukowski's songs were featured on later records, and he continued acting in his capacity as tour manager. 

1983 found Black Flag with fresh songs and a new direction, but without a bass player, and embroiled in a legal dispute over distribution due to SST's issuing ''Damaged'' (Ginn argued that since MCA was no longer involved the Unicorn deal wasn't legally binding, while Unicorn disagreed and sued SST and Black Flag). Until the matter was sorted out, the band were prevented by a court injunction from using the name "Black Flag" on any recordings. They released a compilation record, ''Everything Went Black'', which was credited to the individual musicians, not "Black Flag". In fact, wherever the original album artwork had the words "Black Flag", they had been covered up with small slips of paper, thus adhering to the letter of the law. 

After Unicorn Records declared bankruptcy, Black Flag were released from the injunction, and returned with a vengeance, starting with the release of ''John McLaughlin's guitar work influenced Ginn. 

Freed legally to release albums, Black Flag was re-energized and ready to continue full steam ahead.   The group recruited bassist Kira Roessler (sister of punk keyboardinst Paul Roessler, of 45 Grave fame) to replace Dukowski, and began its most prolific period. With Roessler, Black Flag had arguably found their best bassist. Dukowski was a powerful player, but Roessler brought a level of sophistication and finesse to match Ginn's increasingly ambitious music, without sacrificing any of the visceral impact required for punk rock. 

1984 saw Black Flag (and the SST label) at their most ambitious. This year they would release four full-length albums, and toured nearly constantly, with Rollins noting 178 performances for the year, and about that many for 1985. With Dukowski gone, Ginn ceded much of the spotlight to Rollins, who has expressed some discomfort<ref>see the track "Henry" from the spoken word compilation double LP "English As A Second Language"(1984)</ref> over being the group's ''de facto'' spokesman, while Ginn was the recognized leader (Ginn wrote the majority of the group's songs and lyrics).

With Roessler on board, Black Flag began earnest experimentation, sometimes to critical and audience disdain: One critic writes that ''Slip It In'' "blurs the line between moronic punk and moronic metal";<ref name="trouser"/> another writes ''My War'' is "a pretentious mess of a record with a totally worthless second side."<ref></ref> Rollins reports that Black Flag's set-lists in this era rarely included older crowd favorites like "Six Pack" or "Nervous Breakdown", and that audiences were often irritated by the new, slower Black Flag. Violence against the band (and especially Rollins) was ever-present, although the vocalist was now an avid weight lifter, and more than able to defend himself. Furthermore, to Rollins' chagrin, Ginn's interest in marijuana steadily increased; as Rollins put it, "By '86 it was 'Cannot separate the man from his Anvil case with a big-ass stash.'"<ref>Azerrad, 58.</ref> Despite the initial resistance to the new music and quasi-psychedelic direction, ''My War'' would later be cited as a formative influence on grunge music. The group would continue to evolve toward a more heavy metal sound, with 1985's ''Loose Nut'' featuring more polished production.

===Later period and break up===
Despite 1984-85 being the most fruitful period for the band and their record label, Ginn and Rollins would ultimately decide to eject Roessler from Black Flag, citing erratic behavior. It's also been suggested that Ginn's accommodating Roessler's college schedule created tension in the group. Her absence, and the lack of a steady drummer (Stevenson quit and was replaced by Anthony Martinez), contributed to the comparatively weak reputation of the last few Black Flag tours. However, the live album ''Who's Got The 10 1/2'' shows the evolving lineup, with Kira and drummer Martinez, to be a powerful and entertaining unit. 

By 1986, Black Flag's members had grown tired of the tensions of their relentless touring schedule, infighting, and of living in near-poverty. The band had been together almost a decade, and true commercial success and stability had eluded them. The group's erratic artistic changes were a barrier to their retaining an audience - Ginn was so creatively restless that Black Flag's records were often very dissimilar. At one point, Rollins apparently said, "Why don't we make a record that was like the last one so people won't always be trying to catch up with what we're doing?"<ref>Azerrad, 59.</ref> Ginn was stunned by the suggestion; it was one of the few times Rollins had ever openly offered an opinion contrary to Ginn's. Perhaps this was why Ginn mixed Rollins' vocals low on the group's next studio album, ''In My Head''. However, the record, with its powerful bluesy proto-grunge-cum-metal, did seem to finally be a cohesive followup to a previous album (''Loose Nut'') - but it would be their last. 

Black Flag played their last concert on June 27, 1986, in Detroit, Michigan; this show has been widely available through online music trading services and is of surprisingly good sound quality. By this point the band had become increasingly talented at performing improvised "jams", with Rollins screaming out lyrics quite literally as they came to him (as is evident on this recording), turning some songs like "Louie, Louie" into frenetic, almost unrecognizable blasts of intensity.
