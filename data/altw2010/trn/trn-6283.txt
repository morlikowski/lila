The '''Independent A1E1''' was a multi-turreted British armaments manufacturer Vickers during the Interwar period. Although it only ever reached the prototype stage it influenced many other tank designs.

The A1E1 design can be seen as a possible influence on the Soviet tank designs German tank designs PzKpfw NbFz V, PzKpfw NbFz VI ''Neubaufahrzeug'', and the British tank designs A9/Cruiser Mk I (triple turret), while the Soviet T-35 tank was a partial copy of the A1E1 based on its plans, which had been obtained through espionage.

==Design==
The Independent was a multi-turret design, having a central gun turret armed with the 3 pdr (47 mm) gun, and four subsidiary turrets each armed with a 0.303 Vickers machine gun. The subsidiary turrets were mounted two at the front and two at the rear, the turrets at the being able to elevate to engage aircraft. The tank was designed to have heavy firepower, self-defence capability, and superiority to enemy weapons.  It had a crew of 8 men, the commander communicating with the crew through an intercom system.

==History==
In 1924 the General Staff of the British Army ordered the prototype of a heavy tank, which became known as the Independent. Largely designed by Walter Gordon Wilson, its 35.8 litre V12 aircooled engine was designed by Armstrong Siddeley, and it also incorporated a new hydraulic braking system which had to be specially developed due to its weight and speed. The prototype was delivered to the War Office in 1926, but was abandoned due to a lack of funds.

The tank was the subject of industrial and political espionage, the plans ending up in the Soviet Union, where they formed the basis of the T-35 tank.
