'''Hazel Ying Lee''' (; U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II.

Hazel was born in Portland, Oregon.  Her father was a merchant.  Her mother devoted her energy to raising 8 children and helping with the family business.  Despite the widespread Anti-Chinese bias of her time, Hazel led a full and active life. Hazel swam, played handball, loved to play cards and in her teenage years, learned how to drive. 

Following graduation from high school in 1929, Hazel found a job as an elevator operator at Liebes Department Store in downtown Portland. This was one of the few jobs that a Chinese American woman could hold during this time period. 

In 1932, Hazel took her first airplane ride. At a time when less than 1% of pilots in the US were women, Hazel joined the Chinese Flying Club of Portland and took flying lessons with famed aviator Al Greenwood. Despite opposition from her mother, Hazel “had to fly.” In discussing Hazel’s love of flying, her sister Frances said,  “It was the thought of doing something she loved. Hazel enjoyed the danger and doing something that was new to Chinese girls.” 

In October 1932, Hazel Ying Lee became one of the first Chinese American women to earn a pilot’s license. In speaking of Hazel and the handful of other Chinese American women pilots of that time, author Judy Yung has written “Although few in number, these first Chinese American aviators, in their attempt to participate in a daring sport, broke the stereotype of the passive Chinese women and demonstrated the ability of Chinese American women to compete in a male dominated field.” While in Portland Hazel met her future husband 'Clifford' Louie Yim-Qun.

==Time in China==
In response to Japanese aggression against Western China in Canton and spent the next few years flying for a private airline. She was one of a very small number of women pilots in China.  

In 1937, Japan invaded China. Hazel remained in China despite the war and was in Canton when hundreds of civilians were killed in Japanese air attacks. Friends speak of Hazel’s calm while bombs fell all around and remember Hazel’s effort to find shelter for friends, neighbors and family. Thanks to Hazel, all survived the bombings attacks. Following another unsuccessful effort to join the Chinese Air Force, Hazel escaped to Hong Kong and returned to the USA in 1938. In New York, Hazel worked for the Chinese government as a buyer of war materials for besieged China. 

==Military career==
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, America was drawn into World War II. As the War claimed the time and lives of American pilots, it became clear that there were not enough male pilots to sustain the War effort at home. With the active support of Army Air Force Commander Henry “Hap” Arnold, the Women Airforce Service Pilots or “WASP,” was created in 1943, under the command of famed aviator Jacqueline Cochran.   

Experienced women pilots, like Hazel, were eager to join the WASP, and responded to interview requests by Cochran. Members of the WASP reported to Avenger Field, in wind swept Sweetwater, Texas for an arduous 6-month training program. Hazel was accepted into the 4th class, 43 W 4. Hazel Ying Lee was the first Chinese American woman to fly for the United States military.

Although flying under military command, the women pilots of the WASP were classified as civilians. They were paid through the civil service. No military benefits were offered. Even if killed in the line of duty, no military funerals were allowed. The WASPs were often assigned the least desirable missions, such as winter trips in open cockpit airplanes. Commanding officers were reluctant to give women any flying deliveries. It took an order from the head of the Air Transport Command to improve the situation. 

Upon graduation, Hazel was assigned to the third Ferrying Group at Romulus, Michigan. Their assignment was critical to the war effort; Deliver aircraft, pouring out of converted automobile factories, to points of embarkation, where they would then be shipped to the European and Pacific War fronts. In a letter to her sister, Hazel described Romulus as “a 7-day workweek, with little time off.” When asked to describe Hazel’s attitude, a fellow member of the WASP summed it up in Hazel’s own words, “I’ll take and deliver anything.”

Described by her fellow pilots as “calm and fearless,” Hazel had two forced landings. One landing took place in a Kansas wheat field. A farmer, pitchfork in hand, chased her around the plane while shouting to his neighbors that the Japanese had invaded Kansas. Alternately running and ducking under her wing, Hazel finally stood her ground. She told the farmer who she was and demanded that he put the pitchfork down. He complied.

'''李月英''' （Hazel Ying Lee 1912年8月24日－1944年11月25日），美國華僑，出生於美國奧勒岡州波特蘭市，祖籍廣東台山市大江镇水楼村。

== 早年 ==
父亲经商，母亲是传统的家庭主妇，要幫忙丈夫的生意，也要照顾八个孩子。她在年輕時游泳，打手球，喜歡玩牌，也學會了開車。李月英1929年高中毕业后，在波特兰市中心的一家百货公司作电梯操作员的工作，在当时歧視有色人種的環境裡，这是当时华人女性被许可从事的少数工作之一。

== 學習飛行與返回中國 ==
1932年不顧父母亲坚决反对，接受愛國華僑的資助，在美國奧勒岡州波特蘭美國華僑航空學校學習飛行。校友及同學包括陳瑞鈿、黃泮揚、黃桂燕、蘇英祥、雷炎均、劉龍光、林覺天、雷國來、楊仲安等。1933年與男同學一起志願回到中國希望加入空軍，可惜當時空軍不收女性飛行員，後居留廣東擔任民航飛行員。1937年全面抗戰爆發，再度志願加入中國空軍的飛行行列不遂，於是從事宣傳工作與開辦學校。1938年返美國紐約任國民政府駐美採購員。

== 美國婦女飛行隊 ==
1943年加入新成立的美國婦女空軍服務飛行隊，為少數華人女子飛行員的先驅。有一次因為引擎故障，飛機迫降在堪薩斯州的麥田裡。農夫以為她是來侵略的日本人，拿起草叉指著李月英，她請農夫放下草叉並請農夫的兒子打電話到基地澄清這誤會並派車來接她。1944年4月，李月英接受儀器訓練，準備飛更高級的飛機。6月希望成為正式軍官的她接受軍官培養訓練，當時盛傳她們也會成為正式軍官，但後來並未成事實。9月她又接受驅逐機訓練，並於10月2日畢業，成為第一位駕駛軍機的華人女子飛行員，也成為第一位駕駛驅逐機（當時戰鬥機的名稱）的華人女子飛行員。當時主要任務是將新飛機由工廠飛到目的地機場。

許多女子飛行員為美國付出生命，但在因公殉職後，並未得到應享的國家待遇。一直到1977年，一部有关承认婦女飛行隊在军队中地位的法律获得通过，婦女飛行隊成员们终于能和其他退役军人一样，获得公正的历史评价。

== 開朗的個性 ==
她的幽默感确实让大家难以忘怀，也很淘气，恶作剧的功夫属一流。例如她用口红在自己与同事的飞机机翼写上中国字，还有一次她开一名身材肥胖的飞行员玩笑，在对方的机尾以中文写上他看不懂的绰号。李月英还有一个特色，不管在任何大城市或小乡镇，她总能找到中国餐馆吃上一顿丰盛的中国菜，甚至鑽進廚房請廚師或自己參與作幾道菜。另一位婦女飞行员Sylvia Dahmes Clayton说：“Hazel给了我一个机会让我了解不同的文化，增广我的视野，也扩大了我的生活领域。”
