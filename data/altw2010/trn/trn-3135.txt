'''Badajoz''' - (IPA , formerly written '''Badajos''' in English), the capital of the Spanish province of Badajoz in the autonomous community of Portuguese border, on the left bank of the river Guadiana, and the Madrid-Lisbon railway. The population in 2007 was 145,257.

Badajoz is the see of a bishop. It occupies a slight eminence, crowned by the ruins of a Moorish castle, and overlooking the Guadiana. A strong wall and bastions, with a broad moat and outworks, and forts on the surrounding heights, give the city an appearance of great strength. The river, which flows between the castle-hill and the powerfully armed fort of San Cristobal, is crossed by a magnificent granite bridge, originally built in 1460, repaired in 1597 and rebuilt in 1833. The whole aspect of Badajoz recalls its stormy history; even the cathedral, built in 1238, resembles a fortress, with massive walls.

==History==

Owing to its position the city enjoys a considerable transit trade with Portugal; its other industries include the manufacture of linen, woollen and leather goods, and of pottery.

It is not mentioned by any Roman historian, and first rose to importance under Moorish rule. It was founded by the Galician Muslim Ibn Marwan around 875 and after 1022 it became the capital of a small Moorish kingdom (Emirate of Badajoz), and, though temporarily held by the Portuguese in 1168, it retained its independence until 1229; when it was captured by Alfonso IX of Leon.

As a frontier fortress it underwent many sieges. It was beleaguered by the Portuguese in 1660, and in 1705 by the Allies in the Beresford, endeavoured to retake it, and on Albuera, but the siege was abandoned in June.

===The Storming of Badajoz, 1812===
''main article Battle of Badajoz (1812)

In Duke of Wellington) again attempted to take Badajoz, which had a French garrison of about 5,000 men. Siege operations commenced on March 16, and by early April there were three practicable breaches<ref>A practicable breach was one where two soldiers could get through side by side without needing to use their hands</ref> in the walls.  These were assaulted by two British divisions on April 6, 1812.

The attacks were pressed with great gallantry for five hours, but repeatedly beaten back with heavy loss.  Meanwhile the castle, and another section of undamaged wall, had been attacked by escalade and successfully taken by the British.  At the cost of some 5,000 casualties, Wellington had succeeded in taking Badajoz. He wrote to Lord Liverpool
''"The capture of Badajoz affords as strong an instance of the gallantry of our troops as has ever been displayed, but I anxiously hope that I shall never again be the instrument of putting them to such a test as that to which they were put last night"''
(However, the storming of San Sebastián in 1813 was much like Badajoz)

In the 95th to form Sherwood Foresters Regiment) succeeded in getting into the castle first and the red coatee of Lt. James MacPherson of the 45th was hoisted in place of the French flag to indicate the fall of the castle. This feat is commemorated on the 6 April each year when red jackets are flown on Regimental flag staffs and at Nottingham Castle.

With the town taken, military discipline largely disappeared, and the town was subjected to two days of pillage, murder, rape and drunkenness by the British survivors. The only way to restore order was to erect the gallows and flog many soldiers.

(Sir Harry Smith undertook to protect two young ladies from any insult during the sack of Badajoz, one of whom he married. In consequence Ladysmith is named after a former inhabitant of Badajoz, Juana Maria Smith)
