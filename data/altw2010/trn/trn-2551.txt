The following is a list of characters in the ''Bartimaeus Trilogy'' by Jonathan Stroud.

<br clear=all>

=== Simon Lovelace ===
The main antagonist of the first book, Lovelace was a rising star in the Ministry (the Junior Minister of Trade) until, in his ambition, tried to rise too fast and as a result was sidelined by the Prime Minister Rupert Devereaux. Lovelace attempts to organise a coup d'état by summoning Ramuthra, an extremely powerful entity (far more powerful than a marid) to kill the one hundred most important Ministers of the government, and thus come to power. The first evidence of Lovelace's plot in the novel was revealed when Nathaniel spies on Lovelace and sees the mercenary that Lovelace hired to steal the Amulet of Samarkand, committing murder in the process. After having it stolen from Lovelace himself for a time by Nathaniel's djinni Bartimaeus, Lovelace recovered it and had his djinni Jabor destroy Nathaniel's incompetent master, his wife and house. Lovelace's coup was staged at Heddleham Hall with him and all the ministers in large room which turned out to be a giant pentacle. Lovelace summoned Ramuthra with a Summoning Horn and courtesy of the Amulet, was the only person in the pentacle safe from the great spirit. However, Lovelace's coup was foiled by Nathaniel and Bartimaeus who managed to remove the Amulet from Lovelace, who was promptly swallowed and consumed by Ramuthra, and was then dismissed by Nathaniel breaking the summoning horn. Although he appeared the ringleader of the conspiracy, like Duvall, the real mastermind was revealed to be Makepeace.

He was described by Bartimaeus as good looking in a bookish kind of way, with dark, slicked back, oily hair, glasses, and a square jaw of large, even white teeth which "flash" a lot. He also mentioned Lovelace as "the kind of person who would order murders while sitting at a tea party, sipping tea and eating cucumber sandwiches." A female magician named Devina describes Lovelace as "so handsome" at the State Address at Westminster Hall.

=== Henry Duvall ===
The main, yet hidden, antagonist of the second book, Duvall used a golem to wreak havoc in London. He was a werewolf, and Chief of Police for the empire, a position with no little power. Although he appeared the ringleader of the conspiracy, like Lovelace, the real mastermind was later revealed to be Makepeace. After being caught and held at a prison,he turned into a werewolf and he jumped out of the window, but perished, as the cell was five floors up.

;The Night Police
The Night Police are the main enforcers of the law in London. They were formally lead by Henry Duvall, and then Jane Farrar. The Night Police are werewolves, and are feared by all the Commoners of London. They led Kitty on a large chase, only interrupted by John Mandrake. Similar versions of the Night Police have been used during the era of Ancient Egypt. However they proved largely inefficient when policing, for they were impossible to tame and attacked anybody in sight.

=== Quentin Makepeace ===
One of the antagonists of the third book, and in many ways the main antagonist of the series, Makepeace was (foremost) the playwright responsible for many preformances, including ''The Swans of Araby'', ''Petticoats and Muskets'', and ''From Wapping to Westmister''. He helped to orchestrate the Lovelace Conspiracy, the Golem Affair, and the raid upon Westminster Abbey by the Resistance, but neither one of these plans came to fruition, so he eventually decided to orchestrate a plan of his own. He Summoned a large number of spirits and imprisoned nearly all the major members of the government. He then Summoned Nouda into his own body to gain supernatural powers, but instead his mind is overpowered by Nouda's and destroyed. His body is finally destroyed when the Staff of Gladstone is broken, destroying Nouda. He was the true mastermind behind the Lovelace Conspiracy, the Duvall Affair, and is responsible for most untoward events in the series.

He was described as short and round, redheaded and wore fancy, green clothing. He was a flamboyant, dramatic, friendly and arrogant on the outside. This was all a façade however. Beneath his friendly demeanor was a sadistic, powerful, mastermind who was willing to make his plans work by any means necessary.

== Other Magicians ==
* '''Harold Button''' was a scholar, book collector, teacher of Jones in ''Ptolemy's Gate'', and became part of the Interim Magicians Council as Home Minister at the end of the book. Button was a magician of no little power, able to summon many higher ranking spirits without assistance. However, while summoning a Marid, he made an mistake , in which the Marid was able to break out of its pentacle and tore off his leg before the automatic dismissal could set in. Button was never interested in using his skills for his own ambition, but rather used them as a historical source to further his academic pursuits.
* '''Bruce Collins''' was the Home Secretary. In ''Ptolemy's Gate'', he was turned into a hybrid.
* '''Rupert Devereaux''' was the Prime Minister and de jure Chief of Police in ''Ptolemy's Gate''. He appeared in all three books and was killed in the third book when he became a hybrid. He had light brown hair and a charismatic personality that had greatly inspired Mandrake when he was young, though this respect later dwindled. He had a great passion for the performing arts, and so was great friends with the playwright Quentin Makepeace. He frequently delayed or cancelled government meetings to see plays. Near his death date, he grew paranoid with all the chances of betrayal within the government, and the strain caused his hair to became grey and his face wrinkled.
* '''Jane Farrar''' was the Assistant to the Chief of Police in ''The Golem's Eye'' and de facto Chief of Police in ''Ptolemy's Gate''. She was killed by a stealthy hybrid while directing her legion of werewolves against them. In the second book, she attempted to charm and seduce Mandrake to get information for her master, Henry Duvall, though she was never associated with the conspiracy.
* '''George Ffoukes''' was a member of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in ''The Golem's Eye'' and a fourth-level magician.
* '''Marmeduke Fry''' was the Foreign Secretary in ''The Golem's Eye''. He was slain by an Imp hidden in his pie between the second book, ''The Golem's Eye'', and the third book, ''Ptolemy's Gate'' while trying to negotiate a peace treaty with the Americans.
* '''Harknett''' was Home Secretary between "The Golem's Eye'' and ''Ptolemy's Gate'', but when she spoke out against the Prime Minister's policies he sent six Horlas to her house.
*'''Harlequin''' was a British spy in Prague. He was  described as being old and fat, with an oddly high voice. Nathaniel came to him seeking information about Golems. He had morbid tastes, particularly his 'unusual' candle, presumably a dead man's genitals. He was later shot by Czech soldiers while posing as a hot dog salesman.
* '''Clive Jenkins''' was a secretary in the Ministry Of Internal Affairs in the third book, and died after summoning Naeryan into his body; though only being a first-level magician, he shouldn't have been able to.
* '''Helen Malbindi''' was Information Minister in the second book and Foreign Minister in the third book. She was killed when she became a hybrid. She was described as having a short temper and being under a lot of stress; her nose turned white and bloodless when near a tantrum.
* '''Carl Mortensen''' was the Home Secretary in the second book and Minister of War in the third book and was killed when he became a hybrid.
* '''Sholto Pinn''' was a merchant in all three books, and was sent to hospital at the end of the events in ''Ptolemy's Gate''. When most magicians took off their contact lenses to see the special effects of Makepeace's play without distractions, Pinn kept his monocle on. When he took it off to polish it, Imps and Foliots quickly dispatched the lower levels off the government, while the members of the Council and other higher ranking magicians were taken out by Djinn. When three Djinn attempted to take out Pinn, the merchant grabbed his stick, and destroyed one with a Plasm, injured another, but was beaten by the third, who used the old man's cane as a club against him. One of the few high-level magicians to survive, but oddly, he didn't not take part in the Interim Council. He was rotund and wears white clothing.
* '''Rebecca Piper''' was the assistant to Mandrake in the third book and becomes the de facto Prime Minister of the Interim Magicians' Council at the end of the book. She has vole brown hair scraped back from her hairline and pinned back.
* '''Julius Tallow''' was the Minister of Internal Affairs and a third-level magician in the second book, who accused Jones and Hyrnek of attacking him after they break his car window by accident and subjects them to the Black Tumbler, leaving Hyrnek disfigured. He died when one of Hyrnek's doctored books causes him to mispronounce a syllable while summoning a female Afrit, who swallowed him whole during the Golem Affair.
* '''Arthur Underwood''' was the Minister of Internal Affairs and tutor/master of Mandrake in the first book, and is killed by Jabor while trying to defeat Simon Lovelace. A middle-level magician, he was fueled by paranoia. Bartimaues describes him as looking like the old version of magicians. With a white beard and old clothing, and all he needed to complete the look was a pointed hat and cape. Arthur thought very little of Mandrake and believed him incapable of summoning so much as an Imp, but soon learned that he had summoned Bartimaeus.
* '''Martha Underwood''' was Mr Underwood's wife, who was always very kind to Nathaniel, and was someone he confided his true name to. A rotund woman with gray hair, she was eaten by Jabor in the first book.
* '''Jessica Whitwell''' was Security Minister throughout the series, and died trying to escape the hybrids with Shubit, her spirit, being the only magician with the courage to attempt to stand up to Nouda and the others, other than John Mandrake. She is described as bone thin with cropped white hair. She was considered to be possibly the most powerful magician in the government at the time of the series by John Mandrake. Throughout the series, she is shown to be very professional, strict, and above all, powerful.

=== Historical magicians ===
==== Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) ====
A second century B.C. magician who was one of the first Magician to study the Other Place and the only to visit there and return. He was a benevolent master, who wished to learn from the spirits he summoned rather than subjugate them into slavery, and was described by Bartimaeus as his most beloved master. He was twelve when he first summoned Bartimaeus, the same age Mandrake was in the ''Amulet of Samarkand''. 
Ptolemy was the nephew of Ptolemy VIII and cousin to Ptolemy IX, and he lived in Alexandria. He was kind to the common people and grew in popularity with them. His cousin was jealous and afraid that Ptolemy with steal his place on the throne (even though Ptolemy was part Greek), so he made several attempts to assassinate him.  Finally, with the help of Roman spirits and magicians, Ptolemy IX succeeded. However, before he died, Ptolemy gave Bartimaeus three gifts: that he was treated as an equal, that he could travel the world and that he may live, while Ptolemy would die. Bartimaeus often took his form when in the material world and as a mark of respect and stated that Ptolemy was the only magician who actually trusted enough not to use magic to control him. Ptolemy also created Ptolemy's Gate, a method of reversing summons so that one could travel to the Other Place.

==== William Gladstone ====
Gladstone a very powerful nineteenth century British magician, who rose to become a Prime Minister. He led the Grand Army of the Empire on conquests that decimated countries and made them a part of the British empire, largely through the means of his staff. At the height of the Czech Empire, called The Holy Roman Empire by Bartimaeus, he talked the commoner Parliament into handing power to him and the magicians, and raised Britain to a powerful empire. His staff is endowed with vast magical powers, drawn from several great entities trapped in a space as large as a thimble. The Staff became more powerful as Gladstone himself waned, and ended up being the most powerful talisman in centuries. It was encased with him in his tomb, protected by a mad afrit (Honorius) trapped in his bones. This was later taken by Kitty in the Golem's Eye.

==== Solomon ====
Very powerful magician who lived in the Middle East around 1000 BC, and had a magical ring, the Seal of Solomon, from which he could control over 1,000 spirits (Bartimaeus, Faquarl and Honorius being some).
