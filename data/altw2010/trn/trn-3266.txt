Bernard debutta nel 1989 alla guida della modesta Lola. Finirà l'anno senza ottenere punti. L'anno successivo viene ingaggiato dalla Larrousse, con la quale ottiene cinque punti, sfoggiando un'ottima prestazione al gp di Gran Bretagna, che conclude con un quarto posto, addirittura davanti a Piquet. Nel 1991 viene confermato, ma ottiene un solo punto. Sparisce poi dal circus fino al 1994, anno del suo ritorno. Ha contratto con la Ligier. In quell'anno riesce per la prima volta a ottenere un podio, in Germania. Poi però buio, tanto che non parteciperà alle ultime due gare.

'''Éric Bernard''' (born Lotus teams. 

He started karting in 1976 and in the seven years that followed, won four French titles. In 1983 he attended racing school at Paul Ricard and was one of the finalists at the Volant Elf competition. He beat Jean Alesi and Bertrand Gachot to the prize, earning himself a fully-sponsored drive in Formula Renault for 1984. He finished sixth in the series, but won the following year, and entering French Formula 3 in 1986. He won the series the following year, finishing in second place for the championship, behind his old rival, Alesi. In 1988 he entered Formula 3000. 

In 1989, he was called up to the French French Grand Prix, replacing Yannick Dalmas. On an assured debut, he ran as high as 5th place, and was still in 7th when his Lamborghini V12 engine failed a few laps from the end. Bernard stood in again at the following British Grand Prix, before returning to his Formula 3000 commitments with DAMS.

He was rewarded with a full-season drive for Monaco Grand Prix, and his best result would come at Silverstone in the British Grand Prix, where he took 4th place.

Bernard elected to stay on at Larrousse for the 1991 season, but the team were in trouble, losing their Modena team, having their 1990 points stripped by the FIA and also losing sponsors. Bernard would take 6th place in the Mexican Grand Prix, which was the last points finish for Lola Cars, but slipped back down the field, failing to qualify for the first time in his career at the Italian Grand Prix - partially due to a bereavement. Worse was to come, however, when Bernard broke his leg in the first practice session for the Japanese Grand Prix.<ref>[http://www.teamdan.com/archive/1991/octobe91.html October 1991 Information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Bernard fought back to fitness, and for the 1993 season his old sponsors Elf managed to get him into a test driver seat for the Renault V10 engine was counterweighted by the team using a "B"-spec version of the 1993 JS39 chassis - by this time a very unusual practice in Formula One which greatly harmed competitiveness. Bernard would take third place in the high-attrition German Grand Prix, but by the European Grand Prix he was dropped in order to accommodate Johnny Herbert. He was engaged by Herbert's previous team, Team Lotus, to fill the seat at the European GP, but it was to be his last F1 drive, with Mika Salo taking over later in the season.
