'''Ween''' is een Amerikaanse alternatieve rockgroep. De band is in New Hope, Pennsylvania. 

==De band==
===Beginjaren===
De band begon in 1984, toen beide bandleden 14 waren. Thuis maakte de band opnamen, waarbij ze beïnvloed werd door artiesten als underground punkbands. De band bracht, onder eigen beheer, zes cassettes uit: ''Mrs. Slack'', ''The Crucial Queegie Lip'', ''Axis: Bold As Boognish'', ''Erica Peterson's Flaming Crib Death'', ''The Live Brain Wedgie/WAD'' en ''Prime 5''.

===Vanaf 1989===
In 1989 tekende Ween een contract met Twin/Tone Records en daar brachten ze in 1990 het album ''GodWeenSatan: The Oneness'' en in 1991 het album ''The Pod'' uit. Beide albums zorgen dat de band een grote fanbase kreeg, met name door het gebruik van drummachines, referenties naar drugs, en humor in de muziek. Hoewel de band in de komende jaren verschillende stijlen uitprobeert, zijn dit steevast terugkerende thema's.

Het album ''Nashville, Tennessee, de 'hoofdstad' van de countrymuziek. Het volgende album, ''The Mollusk'' (1997) had een nautisch thema en ''White Pepper'' uit 2000 was meer pop gericht. Tussendoor werd in 1999 nog het album ''Craters of the Sac'' "uitgebracht" door het als gratis MP3 op internet te zetten. In 2000 richtte de band ook de website WeenRadio op, waar het gehele oeuvre (legaal) als stream te beluisteren is. Volgens Rolling Stone magazine was dit, na Napster en Gnutella, de beste muzieksite van het jaar.

Rond de eeuwwisseling richtte de band haar eigen label, La Cucaracha'' (2007) toch uit bij andere labels. Alleen ''Shinola, Vol. 1'' (2005) werd door Chocodog uitgebracht.

'''Ween''' is an Gene and Dean Ween. The name Ween was a cross between the words "wuss" and "peen".<ref>In a November 25, 2007 radio interview on the NPR show ''All Things Considered'', Aaron Freeman's explanation for the band's name was that "~~~~it was a cross between 'wuss' and 'peen', if I remember correctly, and at 15 years old it seemed perfect."  The duo went on to say, "We never thought we'd have to answer for that name at 37 years old."</ref>Thousands of home recordings later, Ween collected a large underground fanbase despite being generally unknown in pop music.

==Early years==
Their earliest home recordings were anarchic and free-spirited, drawing on influences as far-reaching as Queen, Prince, Butthole Surfers, The Residents and the lo-fi punk movement. They self-released 6 cassettes in the late eighties; ''Mrs. Slack'', ''The Crucial Squeegie Lip'', ''Axis: Bold As Boognish'', ''Erica Peterson's Flaming Crib Death'', ''The Live Brain Wedgie/WAD'', and ''Prime 5''. Around this time, Gene also released his own tape, ''Synthetic Socks'', which featured Dean on a few songs. Ween was often compared in their early years to other offbeat artists such as Frank Zappa and Tom Waits though they eschewed such comparisons. Ween's public debut was a "Purple Haze" cover closing a 1987 talent show; the piece featured a solo, stand-up, acoustic bass and Lauren "Rainbow" Fihe, from Elwood, IN, on drums.

==Major releases==
Ween was signed to following year, a 26-track inhalation device, but a marijuana directly to the brain by use of nitrous oxide, which was said to leave the user intoxicated for days, but nauseated. The cover of ''The Pod'' used the cover of the 1975 Leonard Cohen album, ''The Best of Leonard Cohen'', but with the head of Mean Ween (sometime bassist Chris Williams) wearing the  mask, pasted onto that of Cohen.

''Elektra label, featured their highest charting single, "Push Th' Little Daisies" (1992) which gained them media and DAT tapes to provide backings for their songs).

Ween turned to Nashville studio musicians for the recording of the authentically-spirited ''12 Golden Country Greats'' (1996) which only contained ten tracks. There are two theories regarding the title of the album. The first is that it refers to the dozen veteran Nashville studio musicians who played on the album. The second is that the band did indeed record twelve songs during the demo sessions for the album, but upon the removal of the tracks "I Got No Darkside" and "So Long, Jerry" (the latter of which was a B-side on the "Piss Up a Rope" single) they decided not to rename it.

The nautically-themed ''sea shanties, Broadway pop-themed album and final studio set for Elektra.  The track "Even If You Don't" was made into a music video directed by the creators of ''South Park'', Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Shortly after ''White Pepper'' Ween started the internet radiostation [http://www.weenradio.com WeenRadio], which was awarded 3rd best internet music site by Rolling Stone.<ref name="rollingstone1">David Kushner, [http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ween/articles/story/5919334/the_top_ten_best_digital_music_entities_of_2000 The Top Ten Best Digital Music Entities of 2000], ''Rolling Stone'', December 28 2000, retrieved October 2 2007.</ref>

Ween also formed their own label at this time, Live in Toronto'' (a live recording from the 1996 tour, in which Ween performed with Bobby Ogdin & The Shit Creek Boys).  The limited-pressing CD, available exclusively through the band website, became an instant collector's item. Subsequent Chocodog releases (''Shinola'', and announced plans to re-release the 1987 cassette tape by Gene, ''Synthetic Socks''.

The two signed to quebec'', their first studio set in 3 years. In 2004, they released ''Live in Chicago'', a DVD and CD set that compiled tracks from three energetic live performances.

In February of 2006, Dean and Gene, along with their band, rented an old farmhouse and converted it into a working studio. After writing over 50 songs and recording rough versions through 2006, they picked through them and, with Andrew Weiss as producer, re-recorded album versions for what would become ''"The Friends EP"'' and, the full-length, ''La Cucaracha'' which was released October 23, 2007 on Rounder Records.

==Miscellaneous works==
Ween has participated in various outside collaborations over the years. The band joined members of Japanese group The X-Files'', ''Beautiful Girls'', ''Dude, Where's My Car?'' and ''Road Trip'' and ''Herr Lehmann'', and on television they have contributed to ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' ('Ocean Man' and a song about tying shoes "Loop de Loop") and ''Grounded for Life'' (the theme song). The team recorded ''The Shot Heard 'Round the World'' for a 1996 tribute album of classic ''School House Rock'' ditties with the likes of Better than Ezra, Blind Melon, and Moby. Ween had been asked to write a theme song for Greg the Bunny which was rejected.

Also, "Piss up a Rope" can be heard playing in the garage near the start of the movie "U-Turn".

The band has also made several on-screen appearances, including performing on ''Letterman'', on MTV's ''Oddville'', in puppet form on ''Crank Yankers'', as part of ''Chef Aid'' in ''South Park'', and on film as themselves in ''It's Pat''.

Ween has had their music used for several snowboard video parts, including the notable use of "Johnny on the Spot" during snowboarding legend Peter Line's part in the 2000 Mack Dawg film, "The Resistance".

Dean made significant contributions to two projects by his friend Josh Homme: The Desert Sessions and Queens of the Stone Age. On the critically successful 2002 Homme album ''Songs for the Deaf'', Dean played guitar on "Mosquito Song", "Gonna Leave You", and "Six Shooter".

In 2002, the advertising agency for Pizza Hut approached the duo to record a promotional jingle, which resulted in a 30-second recording of "Where'd the Cheese Go?". It epitomized Ween-style irreverence but did not appeal to the agency, and Pizza Hut rejected several versions of the song outright. True to form (and somewhat indignant), Ween rerecorded the same song with new lyrics as "Where'd the Motherfuckin' Cheese Go At?". Both versions are available [http://www.sliceny.com/archives/2004/02/weens_unrelease.php here].

In 2003, "Ocean Man" from ''The Mollusk'' reappeared on television when Honda used the song in an advertisement for its 2004 Civic Coupe.  In 2004, the song appeared during the ending credits of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. "Ocean Man" was also featured on the 2008 Skateboarding film, "Baker Has a Deathwish".

In 2005, "Oh My Dear (Falling in Love)", from ''The Motel'' as the title song.  It also became the DVD Menu song for the film once it was released on DVD.
