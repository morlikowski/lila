'''''Marie Antoinette''''' is a 1938 film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

It was directed by W. S. Van Dyke and starred Norma Shearer as Marie Antoinette, Tyrone Power, John Barrymore, Robert Morley, Anita Louise, Joseph Schildkraut and Gladys George. It was based upon the 1933 biography of the queen by the Austrian writer, Stefan Zweig.

The film was the last project of Irving Thalberg who died in 1936 while it was in the planning stage.  His widow Norma Shearer remained committed to the project even while her enthusiasm for her film career in general was waning following his death. 

With a budget close to 2 million dollars, it was one of the most expensive films of the 1930s but also one of the biggest successes.  Apart from the opulent Hollywood sets, it featured scenes filmed on location at the Palace of Versailles, near Paris, and this was reported to have been the first time a film crew had been allowed to film in the grounds of the palace.

==Synopsis==
The story began in future king of France. Most of the film's introduction is concerned with the young princess's attempt to navigate the treacherous environment of the court at Versailles. The film progresses to follow her life as queen - dealing with her transformation into a charitable, humanitarian but somewhat out-of-touch queen. The final part of the movie follows Zweig's theory that Marie Antoinette "achieved greatness" in the final years of her life, with an emotionally gut-wrenching scene showing the final supper of the royal family before King Louis's execution, the separation of the queen from her young son and the savage murder of her closest friend. The final scene shows Marie Antoinette going to the guillotine, where the audience hears the voice of the sweet-natured young princess who was so excited to be going to France. Shearer refused any complimentary make-up for this scene, and chose to look as haggard and exhausted as the real queen had in her final moments.

==Background==
Norma Shearer was the wife of studio head at Titanic'' of the day in terms of going over budget and promising a romance pasted over historical events.

This is Norma Shearer's defining role, and the actress was nominated for a 1938 Best Actress Academy Award. She eventually lost to Jezebel''. Also nominated was supporting actor Robert Morley who made his movie debut as King Louis XVI. Art direction and the score also garnered recognition from Oscar, but no gold statues went home for people involved in the production.<ref name="dvd review">[http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/marieantoinette1938.php DVD Verdict Review - Marie Antoinette (1938)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Costumes and Set Designs===
The movie had thousands of costumes and lavish set designs. Gilbert Adrian visited France and Austria in 1937 researching the period. He studied the paintings of Marie Antoinette, even using a microscope on them so that the embroidery and fabric could be identical.  Fabrics were specially woven and embroidered with stitches sometimes too fine to be seen with the naked eye.  The attention to detail was extreme, from the framework to hair.  Some gowns became extremely heavy due to the embroidery, flounces and precious stones used.  Ms. Shearer's gowns alone had the combined weight of over 1,768 pounds, the heaviest being the wedding dress. Originally slated to be shot in color many of the gowns were specially dyed.  The fur trim on one of Ms. Shearer's capes was sent out to be dyed the exact shade of her eyes. <ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/dregae/1938normashearer.htm The Costumes of Marie Antoinette | The Movies and the Woman<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The ballroom at Versailles was built to be twice as large as the original. The budget was a then preposterous 2.9 million dollars, and plans to render it in color were scrapped because of concerns it would cost even more to add Technicolor.<ref name="dvd review"/>
