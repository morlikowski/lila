'' Magna International Inc., 1999, p. 57.</ref>  

==Political career==
Poilievre won the Conservative Nepean—Carleton nomination in John Baird turned down suggestions that he should seek the federal nomination in the riding that he then represented in the provincial legislature.

On February 7, 2006, Poilievre was appointed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Hon. John Baird, the President of the Treasury Board.

In the summer of 2006, Poilievre campaigned along with Treasury Board President John Baird for a measure that would reduce the Ottawa-area Queensway-Carleton Hospital's rent payments. Under the terms of the new measure, the hospital would pay only $1 per year, down from $25,000.<ref>  </ref>

According to Maher, ".. Mr. Poilievre has sought to be a key Harper team player, ready to toe the party line with impressive obedience and attack the government's enemies with gusto, no matter how accomplished or vulnerable.  Last year, for example, he accused the Liberal party of harbouring terrorist sympathizers.  This spring [2008] he stood in the House to denounce retired general Rwanda massacres.  He also attacked Oscar-nominated filmmaker Sarah Polley [accusing her] of advocating public funding for "purposeless pornographic or ultra-violent films"."  Ms. Polley's Oscar nomination however had come for Away From Her, and she has never appeared in anything nor participated in producing anything even remotely resembling Mr. Poilievre's representation.

===Parliamentary activities ===

In May 2006, Poilievre's interest in the British rock group Coldplay caused him some unwanted attention when Liberal MP, Marcel Proulx accused him of violating Canada's Office Holder code of conduct by accepting a concert ticket with a $350 value, to see the band perform in Ottawa. Because the value of the ticket was over the $200 maximum permitted for gifts under the code, this would have represented a violation. However, it was later confirmed that Poilievre had paid for his own ticket along with other entertainment expenses including transportation and chicken fingers.<ref>According to 192.197.82.155 (whois: Canadian House of Commons PARL-C1)</ref>

Poilievre was caught on tape using foul language directed at colleagues in a committee meeting,<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://thestar.blogs.com/notebook/2006/06/they_dont_like_.html |title=Political Notebook, June 9, 2006}}</ref> and making unparliamentary arm gestures and was accused of mocking the Speaker of the House of Commons<ref>  </ref><ref>{{cite web
|url=http://thestar.blogs.com/notebook/2006/06/no_adult_superv.html |title=Political Notebook, June 14, 2006}}</ref> in June 2006. Poilievre later apologized for making gestures within the Commons;<ref></ref>  no apology has been made for unparliamentary language within Committee.

Also in June, 2006, Poilievre's behaviour within the Legislative Committee on Bill C-2 was sharply criticized by opposition members as "insulting" following exchanges between himself and a witness giving testimony—a point of concern that was recognized and cautioned by the Committee chair.<ref></ref>

Despite being caught on tape, Poilievre had denied actually swearing, which he clearly had done.

===February 2007 Radio Controversy===
Poilievre's behaviour came under intense national scrutiny in February 2007. During a radio interview with CFRA on February 22, 2007, he asserted that the Liberal party was pandering to extremist members within its own ranks:

<blockquote>"Now we know that a lot of extremist groups and people with some very hard left-wing views have advocated for a long time that these provisions should be scrapped. Now a lot of those people supported Stéphane Dion in the leadership. A lot of them are in Stéphane Dion's caucus. And, for example, there are members of Stéphane Dion's Liberal caucus who want to legalize Hezbollah ..."<ref></ref></blockquote> 

The Liberal Party demanded an apology, and announced that it would be consulting with its lawyers on whether to take civil action against Poilievre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.com/News/article/186204 
|title=The Toronto Star - Liberals 'review legal options' February 27, 2007}}</ref> Ultimately, no legal action was taken.

===Comments about Canadian Aboriginals===
Poilievre suggested that native people need to learn the value of hard work more than they need financial compensation. Poilievre made the comments during a radio interview June 11, 2008, just hours before Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized for abuse Aboriginal children endured in once-mandatory residential schools.<ref name="native comments">

Poilievre said "Now along with this apology comes another $4 billion in compensation for those who partook in the residential schools over those years,." Poilievre went on to question the merits of related compensation payments. "Now, you know, some of us are starting to ask: 'Are we really getting value for all of this money, and is more money really going to solve the problem?'. My view is that we need to engender the values of hard work and independence and self reliance. That's the solution in the long run -- more money will not solve it."<ref name="native comments"/>
