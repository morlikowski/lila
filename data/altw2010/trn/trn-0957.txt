==Political career==

Allard ran his veterinary practice full-time, while representing Larimer and Weld Counties in the Colorado State Senate, from 1983 to 1990. He was best known during his time in the Colorado State Senate for sponsoring the state law limiting state legislative sessions to 120 days.

===US House of Representatives===
Allard served in the United States House of Representatives from Colorado's Fourth Congressional District from 1991 to 1997. As a Colorado Representative, Allard served on the Joint Committee on Congressional Reform, which recommended many of the reforms included in the Contract with America. These reforms were among the first legislative items passed by the Republican controlled Congress in 1995.

===US Senate===
In 1996, Allard was elected to the United States Senate, defeating Tom Strickland by 5 percentage points. He made a pledge at the time to serve just two terms in the Senate before retiring. In 2002, he was re-elected, defeating Strickland again by the same margin.

United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of which he is Ranking Minority member of the Securities, Insurance, and Investment subcommittee
United States Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee   
United States Senate Committee on the Budget

In April 2006, Allard was named by ''Time'' as one of "America's 5 Worst Senators." The magazine called him "The Invisible Man" and said he was one of the "least influential Senators" because he "almost never plays a role in major legislation" and "rarely speaks on the floor or holds press conferences to push his ideas" despite his ten years in the Senate and his presence as a majority party member on two key committees.<ref>Massimo Calabresi and Perry Bacon, Jr., [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1183988,00.html "Wayne Allard: The Invisible Man"], ''Time Magazine'', April 24, 2006, page 28.</ref> The ''Rocky Mountain News'' retorted that ''Time'' made the "wrong call" and that Allard was a "hard-working advocate for Colorado interests."<ref>[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/opinion_columnists/article/0,2777,DRMN_23972_4628453,00.html On Point: Wrong call on Allard : Columns & Blogs : The Rocky Mountain News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The ''Colorado Springs Gazette'' claimed the article was "soft, subjective, snide, impressionistic slop — further proof of the low to which this once-serious publication has sunk."

In 2003, Allard introduced into the Senate the Federal Marriage Amendment, banning same-sex marriages. <ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:SJ1: Search Results - THOMAS (Library of Congress)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
