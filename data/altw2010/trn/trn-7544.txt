'''Belmont Park''' is a major Elmont, Nassau County, Long Island in the Town of Hempstead. Its mile-and-a-half (2.4 km) main track is the largest dirt course in Thoroughbred racing. It first opened May 4, 1905.

==History and Information==
It is world-famous as the home of the Triple Crown. 

Belmont is known as The Championship Track because most every major champion in racing history since the early 20th century has competed on the racecourse -- including each of the 11 Triple Crown winners.

In addition to its importance to racing, "Beautiful Belmont Park" is often called one of the best-landscaped venues in American sports -- especially because of the stately backyard park behind the grandstand, which includes the paddock in which the horses are saddled before each race. The backyard and backstretch are notable for their huge, attractive trees and landscaping, and the infield is dominated by two picturesque lakes.

With some of the elegant aura of its sister track, Del Mar and Santa Anita racecourses in California, Belmont is considered one of the elite racetracks in the sport.

Belmont Park is operated by the non-profit Aqueduct and Aqueduct, Saratoga and the now-defunct old Jamaica Racetrack (The Rochdale Village housing development now occupies the site of Jamaica).

==Expansion plans==
In May 2007, reports surfaced indicating that New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was considering closing Aqueduct Racetrack which is four miles west of Belmont in Ozone Park, New York and turning Belmont into a nearly year round race track when the New York Racing Association lease for all three of New York State's tracks expires at the end of 2007.

According to the plans being discussed, Belmont's stands would be heated, additional barns built for Aqueduct's 400 horses, and the track being modified to accommodate winter racing. In addition, video lottery machines would be introduced.  A new entity would operate Belmont from fall to spring while the New York Racing Association would operate Saratoga Race Course in the summer. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/nyregion/20racing.html Spitzer Is Said to Consider Shutting Aqueduct by Bill Finley, New York Times, May 20, 2007]</ref>

==Belmont: The family and the stakes==
The Belmont Stakes was named after financier and sportsman August Belmont II, a key member of the Westchester Racing Association, which established the racecourse.

The race was first run in 1867 at Jerome Park Racetrack in the Bronx. In 1937, the wrought iron gates that bore an illustration of that first Belmont Stakes were donated to the track by August Belmont II's sole surviving son, Perry Belmont. The gates are now on the fourth floor of Belmont Park's clubhouse.

The Belmont Stakes races have been run at Belmont Park since 1905, with the exceptions of 1911-12, when racing was outlawed in New York State; and the 1963-67 editions, held at Aqueduct while the grandstands at Belmont Park were reconstructed. The first post parade in the U.S. was at the 14th Belmont, in 1880.

Secretariat's finishing time in his 1973 Belmont victory (2 minutes, 24 seconds) set a world record for 1½ miles (2.414 km) on dirt, a world record which still stands. The 31-length victory clinched the first Triple Crown in 25 years, dating back to Citation in 1948.  A statue of Secretariat is in the center of the Belmont paddock.

Another Belmont Stakes achievement is recognized by the "Woody's Corner" display in the first-floor clubhouse lobby,  commemorating the five consecutive Belmont Stakes winners trained by the legendary Woody Stephens from 1982-86.

Other memorable performances in Belmont Park history include the opening of the track in 1905 with the famous dead heat between Met Cap.  In 1923, Belmont Park was host to an international duel between the American and English champions: Zev, winner of the Kentucky Derby, against Papyrus, winner of the Epsom Derby.  Zev won by five lengths in front of the biggest crowd for a match race in a hundred years.  

Belmont Park was the site of the tragedy-marred victory of Ruffian in a 1975 match race.  Ruffian broke down during the race and had to be euthanized; she is buried near the finish line in the infield at Belmont Park, her nose pointed towards the finish pole.

The racetrack was also the site of 1978 Belmont Stakes, a victory that gave Affirmed the Triple Crown; and Triple Crown winner Marlboro Cup in September of that same year. The Marlboro, a key event of the Fall Championship meets in the 1970s and 1980s, included a dramatic come-from-behind win by Forego in the 1976 installment.

The current grandstand, Thoroughbred racing's largest, was completed in 1968 after five years of renovations to the Belmont complex.

==Other key races at Belmont==
In addition to the Belmont Stakes, other major races held at Belmont have included the Jockey Club Gold Cup, the Woodward Stakes, the Suburban Handicap and the Memorial Day standby &mdash; the Metropolitan Handicap, also known as the "Met Mile."  (NYRA moved the Woodward to Saratoga in 2006.)

Two important races for fillies, the Mother Goose Stakes and the Coaching Club American Oaks, are also run at Belmont as the first two installments of the New York Racing Association's Triple Tiara series for fillies. The third is the Alabama Stakes, run at Saratoga. In years past, the New York Filly Triple Crown consisted of the Mother Goose, CCA Oaks and another Belmont race, the Acorn Stakes (which is still run at the track).

All of the above races are contested on dirt; notable turf (grass) races include the Bowling Green Handicap, Man O' War Stakes, Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes and the Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational.

Belmont's Fall Championship meet includes New York Showcase Day in late October, with seven stakes races for New York-bred horses. The richest race on that program is the $250,000 Empire Classic Handicap.

==Belmont Breeze==
The official drink of the Belmont Stakes is the Belmont Breeze, created by Dale DeGroff in 1997 and served every year since at the Triple Crown, although it did not have its own commemorative glass until June 7, 2003, the year that Funny Cide was New York's most promising prospect.
The recipe for the Belmont Breeze is:

:'''<u>BELMONT BREEZE</u>'''

:Shake all ingredients with ice and top with half 7UP and half soda, approximately one ounce of each. Garnish with fresh strawberry and a mint sprig and a lemon piece.

==Old Belmont Park==
August Belmont, Jr and William Collins Whitney along with other investors built the original Belmont race track which opened on May 4, 1905. In its first 15 or so years, Belmont Park featured racing clockwise, in the "English fashion" --allowing the upper-class members of the racing association and their guests to have the races finish in front of the clubhouse, just to the west of the grandstand. (A "field stand," at what was then the top of the stretch, was located east of the grandstand). The original finish line was located at the top of the present-day homestretch. 

The old clubhouse was torn down in the 1950s, along with the Manice Mansion -- the turreted 19th-century homestead that served as the headquarters of Belmont's Turf and Field Club.

A later innovation was created by Joseph E. Widener, who took over track leadership when August Belmont II died in 1924: the Widener Course. It was a straightaway of just under seven furlongs (1,408 m) that cut diagonally through Belmont’s training and main tracks, hitting near the quarter-pole of the main track. The course was removed in 1958. 

There are presently two features of Old Belmont Park remaining today. First is the display of four stone pillars on Charleston, S.C. The pillars had stood at the entrance of the Washington Course of the South Carolina Jockey Club in Charleston, S.C., which operated from 1792 to 1882. The stone pillars are now found at the clubhouse entrance. Lesser known-but more visible-are the racing motif iron railings seen partially bordering the walking ring.  The railings, used as decoration on the south side of the old Belmont grandstand, were salvaged during the 1963 demolition. 

The original Belmont Park was not only unprecedented in its size, but also had the then-new innovation of a Queens Village station, running along the property, tunneling under Hempstead Turnpike, then terminating on the south side of the property. The train terminal was moved to its present location north of the turnpike after the 1956 season.

Near the railroad terminal was yet ''another'' track -- Belmont Park Terminal, a steeplechase course operated by United Hunts until the 1920s.

In addition to racing history, Belmont Park made history in another industry native to the Hempstead Plains -- aviation. Some 150,000 people were drawn to the track on Oct. 30, 1910 at the climax of the a Wright Brothers-staged international aerial tournament, which had started eight years earlier. The event came at the beginning of a period (1910, 1911 and 1912) in which racing was outlawed in New York State.

Eight years later, Belmont and aviation were reunited when the racetrack served as the northern point of the first US air mail route, between the New York area and Washington, DC.

Today, two art displays in the clubhouse of the current Belmont Park commemorate the history of the racetrack -- a long mural by Pierre Bellocq featuring the dominant jockeys, trainers and racing personalities of the track's history; and a series of paintings of Old Belmont Park that were featured at a nearby restaurant before the eatery closed.

==Belmont Park today==
The last race at the old Belmont Park was run in October 1962. The following spring, NYRA Chairman James Cox Brady announced that two separate engineering surveys found the grandstand/clubhouse was unsafe due to age-induced structural defects and needed to be rebuilt. The book ''Belmont Park: A Century of Champions,'' noted the comment of NYRA President Edward T. Dickinson: "When you sighted down the stands, you could see some of the beams were twisted. They were in something of an S-shape."

The old structure was demolished in 1963, with the new grandstand being built 1964-1968 (the Inner Turf Course was also added during this time). The Belmont race meetings were moved to South Ozone Park, Queens, during that time. 

The new $30.7 million Belmont Park grandstand, designed by Pimlico, Belmont does ''not'' allow paying spectators to picnic in the infield.
