'''Hanes Mall''' was SouthPark Mall in Charlotte is the largest mall, including outdoor retail area), with nearly 1.5 million square feet (139,000 m²) of retail space. The mall is located just off I-40 on Silas Creek Parkway between Stratford Road and Hanes Mall Boulevard in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

The original mall, the north wing, was opened in 1975 with Sears. In 1990, a new wing was built, expanding the mall southward to include Thalhimers (converted to Hecht's in 1992, and to Macy's in 2006) and a new food court.  

Because of this design, one must go through J.C. Penney to cross from one wing to the other. In addition, the mall is built into the side of the hill; patrons enter through the first floor on the east side of the mall, but must enter on the second floor on the west side. Hanes Mall is two stories throughout, with the exception of Belk and Macy's, which each have an additional floor. 

The road that loops the mall's parking lot is known as Hanes Mall Circle and is the address for many outlying businesses including General Cinema movie theater until the mid-1990s; it stood at the spot that is now home to Golden Corral.
