'''Apple I''' (Відомий також, як '''Apple-1''') - один з перших персональних комп'ютерів, розроблений Стівом Возняком для особистого використання. Його приятель Стів Джобс запропонував продавати комп'ютер. Таким чином в квітні 1976 року Apple I був презентований в Клубі саморобних комп'ютерів в Пало-Альто, Каліфорнія. 

В продаж комп'ютер вийшов в липні 1976 за ціною 666,66 доларів. Розповідають, що в місцевий магазин він продавався за 500 доларів, до яких додавалась націнка, що становила третину від даної суми. Причиною такого рішення було те, що Стів Возняк любив числа з однаковими цифрами.

The '''Apple I''', also known as the '''Apple-1''', was an early hand-built by Apple's first product, demonstrated in April 1976 at the Wozniak, Steven: "iWoz", page 180. W. W. Norton, 2006. ISBN 13:978-0-393-06143-7</ref> and because they originally sold it to a local shop for $500 and added a one-third markup. About 200 units were produced. Unlike other hobbyist computers of its day, which were sold as kits, the Apple I was a fully assembled circuit board containing about 30 chips. However, to make a working computer, users still had to add a case, power supply, keyboard, and display. An optional board providing a cassette interface for storage was later released at a cost of $75.

The Apple I is sometimes credited as the first personal computer to be sold in fully assembled form; however, some argue that the honor rightfully belongs to other machines, such as the MOS Technology KIM-1, Datapoint 2200, or more commonly the Altair 8800 (which could be bought in kit or assembled form at extra cost).  One major difference sets the Apple I apart — it was the first personal computer to use a keyboard.

The Apple I's built-in keyboard and an inexpensive LEDs, most commonly) for output, and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to a computer terminal or a teletype machine. This made the Apple I an innovative machine for its day. In April 1977 the price was dropped to $475.<ref>http://www.applefritter.com/node/2703</ref>. It  continued to be sold through August 1977, despite the introduction of the RAM, color graphics, sound capabilities, additional expansion slots and was notably contained in a styled plastic case with an integrated keyboard. Apple had dropped the Apple 1 from its price list by October 1977, officially discontinuing it.<ref>http://www.applefritter.com/node/2707</ref>

As of 2008, an estimated 30 to 50 Apple Is are still known to exist, making it a very rare collector's item. An Apple I reportedly sold for $50,000 at auction in 1999; however, a more typical price for an Apple I is in the $14,000&ndash;$16,000 range. A software-compatible clone of the Apple I (Replica 1) produced using modern components, was released in 2003 at a price of around $200. <ref>[http://www.applefritter.com/briel replica 1 | Applefritter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
