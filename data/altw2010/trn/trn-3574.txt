'''Düren''' is a town in Düren district. It is located between Aachen and Cologne on the river Rur.

== History ==
=== Romans ===
The history of Düren probably started more than 2000 years ago. Before Christ's birth, the Germanic tribes settled this area. They were conquered by the Romans under Julius Caesar. 

Durum became a supply area for the rapidly growing Roman city of Cologne. Furthermore, a few important Roman roads skirt Durum (including the road from Cologne to Jülich and Tongeren and the road from Cologne to Zülpich and Trier). the Romans remained in the area for about 400 years. The name "villa duria" occurred the first time in the Frankish Annals in the year 747.

After the authority of the Romans, in the 5th century the Franks came to Düren. The Frankishking Pippin der Kleine (Pippin the Short) often visited Düren in the 8th century and held a few important conventions. Pippin was the father of the famous emperor Charlemagne. The Franks made of Durum a royal palace, from which the name Palatine (Pfalz in German) is derived. Charlemagne sojourned a few times there. The castle was built at the place where the Saint Anne Church is located today. Due to the frequent visits of Charlemagne, a few markets sprang up, such as the corn market, cattle market, wood market, chicken market, and butter market, all of which contributed to Düren's development.

=== Middle Ages ===
Düren obtained city rights in the early 13th century. Around 1200, the construction of the city wall was started, which includes 12 towers and 5 gates. The gates faced all directions: in the north, the ''Philippstor'') and the ''Wirteltor'', in the east the ''Kölntor'' (Cologne gate), in the south the ''Obertor'' and in the west the ''Holztor'' (wooden gate). There are still ruins of the gates today.

The chiseler Leonhard stole a small box with the relic of saint's day of Saint Anne (July 26) is celebrated for one week with the Anna octavos and the Anna parish fair, one of the biggest folk festivals of Germany.
 
=== 17th to 19th century ===
In 1642, Düren was embroiled in the plague broke out and caused many lives to be lost. A second plague epidemic broke out in 1665. Due to the various attacks on the debilitated city, Düren as destroyed again in 1679. In this time, the settlement Miesheim was destroyed, never to be rebuilt.

Towards the end of the year 1755 in the area around Düren and Mercalli scale. The series of earthquakes affected all of Europe, most famously the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

The businesses in the area of Düren was affected since the 15th century by the iron foundries.

In the year 1794, Düren was occupied by French revolutionary troops. From 1798 until 1814, Düren was the main city of the same named canton in the arrondissement Aachen of the French ''Roerdepartements'' (from the name of the River Rur (Roer) and ''départment''). After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Düren was ceded to the Kingdom of Prussia and was subsequently administered within the Rhine Province.

=== 20th century ===
By 1900, Düren was among Germany's richest cities (with 42 millionaires and 93 factories) and had a population of 27,168. By comparison, less than 5000 people had lived in Düren a century earlier.   

The city of Düren was located on the main fighting front during the Allied invasion of Germany in Battle for Hürtgenwald was fought on Düren's district area, and on air bombings. Approximately 22,000 people lived in Düren at that time, and 3,000 of them died during the bombing.  Those who survived were evacuated to central Germany.
