'''Denis Anthony Hickie''' (Leinster. His primary position was on the wing. He is also known as Disco Denis as a result of his quick feet dancing skills. Other names include Le Hique, Tickets, and DenDen.

== Career ==

Hickie was educated at St Marys College in Rathmines and led them to the Leinster Schools Senior Cup title in 1994. He went on to university in UCD, where he completed a commerce degree. At UCD Denis was on a dual scholarship for rugby union and athletics.

He made his senior debut for Leinster on the 6th September 1996 in a friendly match away to a Genoa President's XV.

Denis made his senior Irish debut on caps for Ireland. He has scored 29 tries for Ireland and currently holds the Irish try scoring record jointly with his friend and Leinster colleague Brian O'Driscoll.

He was widely regarded as unfortunate to miss out on selection to the 2001 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia. He overcame a ruptured Achilles tendon sustained during the 2003 World Cup and forced his way back into the line-up, apparently losing nothing of his pace.

His solid form in the 2005 Six Nations earned Denis a call-up for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand and the Leinster back became a key member of the successful midweek team.

Denis has suffered many injuries throughout his career. His most recent injury occurred in October 2005, in the week coming up to the European Cup, when Denis dislocated his right 2fm on Friday 20 October 2006 from 8pm until 10pm for one night only <ref>RTE Web [http://www.rte.ie/2fm/story/1110154.html]</ref> He had previously filled in for her when she was on holiday before the summer. Denis is an avid music fan with a varied taste in music and is also a regular gig goer. When interviewed by Ireland's Hot Press magazine, he said
"“Unfortunately a lot of the people I seem to like are dead now. I’m a huge Elliott Smith fan and I really love Nick Drake’s stuff. Obviously, though, I won’t be seeing them in concert anytime soon.<ref>Hot Press -”[http://www.hotpress.com/archive/2788860.html]</ref>
