The twin-engined '''British Aerospace BAe 125''' is the world's best selling mid-size corporate jet, with newer variants now marketed as the British Royal Air Force as a navigation trainer (as the '''Hawker Siddeley Dominie T Mk. 1'''), and was used by the United States Air Force as a calibration aircraft (as the '''C-29''').

==Development==
In 1961, 1962 powered by the Bristol Siddeley Viper turbojet

The aircraft went through many designation changes during its service life. Originally DH.125, it was renamed the '''HS.125''' after de Havilland became a division of BAC to form British Aerospace in 1977, the name changed to '''BAe 125'''. Then, when 1993, the jet acquired the name '''Raytheon Hawker'''. The fuselage, wings and tail-fin are to this day fully assembled and partially equipped (primary and secondary flight controls) in Airbus UK's Broughton plant in Wales, sub-assemblies are produced in Airbus UK's Buckley (Bwcle in Welsh) site. All these assembled components are then shipped to Wichita, Kansas in the United States, to where final assembly was transferred in 1996.

Over 1,000 aircraft have been built.
