==Biography==
===Early life===
Slash was born in English father and an African-American mother.  Slash's mother, Ola Hudson, worked as a costume designer for David Bowie, and his father was an artist who contributed live ensembles for famous musicians including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/15808331/slash_the_rolling_stone_interview 'Rolling Stone' interview], issue #596</ref> Slash was raised in the city of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, until the age of 11, when his parents relocated the family to Los Angeles, California in the mid-1970s; however, they separated, and afterward, he lived primarily with his mother and lived next to David Geffen. He was given the nickname "Slash" by family friend Seymour Cassel, according to whom Saul "was always in a hurry, zipping around from one thing to another."<ref>[http://www.snakepit.org/bio.html Snakepit.org]</ref><ref>[http://swindlemagazine.com/issueicons/slash/ Swindle Magazine]</ref>

At 16, before dropping out of Crespi Carmelite High School, Slash was given his first guitar by his grandmother. It only had 1 string. He spent hours each day practicing.  Eventually, his entire focus was put on music and he made the decision to quit school. In a ''Rolling Stone'' magazine article, he remarked:

In addition to Aerosmith, Slash's early influences included Queen, Rolling Stones, Thin Lizzy, Van Halen and Festival of Weeks.

In 1983, after failing to join Poison with childhood friend Steven Adler, they together formed Road Crew. Slash placed an advertisement in a newspaper for a bassist, and received a response from Duff McKagan. 

When Road Crew disbanded, Slash joined a local band known as Black Sheep. Headed by Willie Bass, the band shared an agent with another new group known as Hollywood Rose. In 1984, both bands opened for Christian metal band Stryper. After the show, Slash and lead singer Axl Rose were introduced to one another by a friend. The two quickly became friends, and several months later, Slash and Steven Adler were invited to join with Axl Rose, Duff McKagan and Izzy Stradlin as the band, Guns N' Roses.

===Guns N' Roses===

Guns N' Roses toured bars and opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. It was during this period that they wrote most of their classic material, including "Geffen. From the start, they spent half of their advance on clothes, and the other half on alcohol and drugs. It was during this period that the "Most Dangerous Band In The World" tag was first attached to them. In 1988, Slash remarked: 

After the release of ''Appetite for Destruction'' in the summer of 1987, a tour with Iron Maiden was canceled when Slash was packed off to Hawaii to kick a drug habit, while Axl ended up in intensive care at an LA hospital after attacking a police officer. By 1988, Guns N' Roses scored its first #1 hit with "Sweet Child o' Mine", a song spearheaded by Slash's memorable riff and guitar solo. There are a number of lists that place him as one of the greatest guitarists alive, and many of his riffs and solos are still featured in "best of" lists around the world. With 15 million copies sold in the United States, it is the second highest selling debut album of all time, behind Boston's debut album.

In 1988, Guns N' Roses released ''G N' R Lies''. Though this album only had eight tracks (four of which had already been released), it was highly successful, selling over 5 million copies.  After a four year hiatus, Guns N' Roses returned with ''Use Your Illusion'' discs. The albums indicated a change in musical direction for Guns N' Roses, including more artistic and dramatic songs like "November Rain" and "Estranged". As Rose expressed a desire to pursue more progressive genres, Slash and McKagan fought to maintain their traditional sound as a punk/blues-based hard rock band. Slash later cited this issue as a key component to his inability to work with Rose on any creative level.

In 1991 the band released ''American citizen. 

In the mid-90s, Slash wrote several songs for what would have become Guns N' Roses' follow up album to ''Use Your Illusion I'' and ''II''. Rose rejected the material, leading Slash to form It's Five O'Clock Somewhere'' in 1995. Critically, the album was praised for ignoring the conventions of grunge and alternative music. It also fared well on the charts, eventually selling over 1.2 million copies in the United States with little promotion from Geffen. 

In an attempt to salvage Guns N' Roses, Zakk Wylde, initially of Ozzy Osbourne fame in the late eighties and early nineties, was invited to jam with the band, but both Slash and Wylde agreed that Gn'R did not have space for two of the world's pre-eminent lead guitarists, although they remain good friends to this day.

On October 30, 1996, it was discovered that Slash was officially no longer a part of the band, as lead singer Axl Rose sent a fax to MTV stating he and his former guitarist had experienced several disagreements regarding the band's musical direction, and ultimately parted ways. 

A crucial moment leading up to Slash's decision to quit the band occurred when Rose removed a section of Slash's guitar track on a cover of "Sympathy for the Devil". Without his consent, Rose replaced Slash's guitar overdub with the work of Paul Tobias, a friend of Rose whom Slash and the rest of the band vocally disapproved of for years. Additionally, as revealed on a VH1 special, Slash stated that he never truly forgave Axl for his spiteful rant regarding some of his fellow band-mates during a 1989 concert.

===After Guns N' Roses===

After his departure from Guns N' Roses, Slash focused on his side-project, The Snakepit, playing a few tour dates before disbanding the group in 1998. Over the next decade, Slash would become an in-demand session musician, recording music with the likes of Alice Cooper, Sammy Hagar, Insane Clown Posse, Ronnie Wood, Bad Company, Cheap Trick, Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, and Aaron Weddle. 

In 1990, Slash was contacted by Dangerous''. He played guitar on two hit singles, "Black Or White"(song intro) and "D.S.", a controversial song from the 1995 ''Invincible'' track "Privacy". Also in 2001, he joined Jackson on stage at the Black Or White" and "Beat It". 

In 1995, Quentin Tarantino asked Slash to contribute music to his famed adaptation of Jackie Brown. Several Snakepit compositions can be heard throughout the film. In 1996, Slash collaborated with Marta SÃ¡nchez to record the flamenco inspired "Obsession-Confession" for the ''Curdled'' soundtrack. The song was received well by Smooth Jazz radio stations. Later that year, Slash also played live with Alice Cooper at Sammy Hagar's club Cabo Wabo in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The show was recorded and released the following year as ''A Fistful of Alice''.

In 1997, Slash (alongside the late rock remix version of their hit single "Fix". In 2003, he participated in the Birdland'', released on the Favored Nations label.  He played lead guitar in the track "Over, Under, Sideways, Down." In early 2003, Slash also made an appearance at a rally to protest the coming War in Iraq called "Peace on the Beach." Specifically, Slash performed the song "Imagine" by John Lennon. Ed Kowalczyk provided vocals during this performance.

In 2000, he chose to regroup Ain't Life Grand''. The album did well on the charts, reaching platinum status. To promote it further, Slash embarked on an extensive world tour with AC/DC in the summer of 2000. 

In 2002, he reunited with Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum for a benefit/tribute concert for Randy Castillo. Realizing they still had the chemistry of their days in Guns N' Roses, they decided to form a new band together. The band that featured Slash, McKagan, and Sorum also featured former Buckcherry members Keith Nelson and Josh Todd. Later Duff put out a statement that Josh and Keith didn't quite fit with the band, and they added Dave Kushner as rhythm guitar and, after a long search, Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland. In 2006, Slash performed a guest spot on keyboardist Derek Sherinian's solo album ''Blood of the Snake'' covering the 1970 Mungo Jerry hit single "In the Summertime", also featuring Billy Idol on vocals. A video was also made featuring Slash, Billy, and Derek for this song.

===Velvet Revolver and future endeavors===
thumb|left|Slash with Velvet Revolver in 2004
Velvet Revolver began as "The Project", a venture by Slash, Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum to find a new lead singer. On rhythm guitar, they initially worked with Izzy Stradlin, and they were offered to open for The Rolling Stones but Slash, Duff and Matt wanted to have a lead singer; after this  Izzy became less involved. They would find their second guitarist in the form of Dave Kushner, who had previously played with McKagan in "Loaded" prior to this project. For many months, the four of them listened to demo tapes of potential lead singers, a monotonous process (documented by VH1). After many months, Slash and the others were almost ready to give up. However, Stone Temple Pilots had recently imploded, allowing lead singer Scott Weiland to volunteer to record a song with the band. Realizing there was chemistry between each member, Weiland officially joined the band in 2003.

Velvet Revolver played several concerts in the summer of that year and released their first single, "Set Me Free" as part of the soundtrack for ''The Hulk''. In June 2004, they released their first studio album, ''Contraband''. A 19-month long tour ensued, as the album went double platinum and re-established Slash as a mainstream performer. After the tour concluded, he and his bandmates took a lengthy break before beginning work on their second album. In July 2007, Velvet Revolver released the critically acclaimed Libertad, a follow-up to their multi-platinum debut.  Following their second studio album, Velvet Revolver imbedded on another fantastic tour.  Fans travelled all over the globe to see their favourite band.  But, fans were shocked when Scott Weiland (lead vocalist) announced to their audience at their glasgow gig that they 'were watching something special,' 'the bands last ever tour.'  The remaining band mates knew nothing of this so called  'last tour.'  This announcement was one of the final straws in the bands reasons to release Scott from his position.  On 1st April 2008, Scott Weiland officially split from Velvet Revolver.  Even though they are currently without a singer, Velvet Revolver are planning a third album and are currently undergoing auditions for a new volcalist.

Slash is a playable character in the video game ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'', and his likeness appears on the game cover. Slash did motion capture with RedOctane to record his movements for the game, and by beating him in a one-on-one competition (playing an original composition he recorded solely for the game), unlocks him as a playable character. Beating him in this challenge leads to the player and Slash playing the master track of "Welcome to the Jungle" as an encore song.

In 2007, Slash performed with Paulina Rubio on the hit Latin single "''Nada Puede Cambiarme''". 

On March 12, 2007. Slash and Velvet Revolver paid tribute to Van Halen by inducting the band into the Rock N' Roll hall of fame. The band also played 2 covers.

Slash appears on the cover of [http://www.guitarworld.com Guitar World] magazine for their July 2007 issue, the "20 year salute to Appetite for Destruction". The title is "''The Cat In The Hat Is Back''" and it pictures him holding his guitar with a snake crawling up the neck. The issue also includes a detailed interview with the artist, and what promises to be the start of a new column entitled "''The Cat In The Hat''".

Slash made numerous contributions to ''The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star'' by Nikki Sixx, published September 18th, 2007.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0743486285 The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star]</ref> 

An autobiography titled simply ''Slash'' was published on October 30th, 2007.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Slash/dp/0061351423 Slash] bio from Amazon.com (pub. 29th in UK)</ref> It was co-written with Anthony Bozza.

It was announced by kerrang Magazine that Slash was going to appear on Ace Frehley's next solo album

===Honors===
Slash won the "Best Guitarist" prize in the 2005 Esky Music Awards in ''Esquire'' magazine. A write-up in the magazine announced Slash's win read as follows:

"He's who we see ourselves as every time we strap on an air guitar. The top hat. The hair. The dangling cigarette. The near-death experiences. He'll always be Slash of Guns N' Roses to us, but we also congratulate him for beating the comeback odds with a surprisingly legitimate and vital outfit, Velvet Revolver."<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=34451 SLASH Named 'Best Guitarist]' By ESQUIRE Magazine</ref>

:''Den hÃ¤r artikeln handlar om musikern Slash. FÃ¶r fanfiction-genren, se Slash (fanfiction).'' 
'''Slash''', egentligen '''Saul Hudson''', fÃ¶dd 23 juli 1965 i Hampshire, England, Ã¤r en Brittisk-amerikansk gitarrist mest kÃ¤nd frÃ¥n Guns N' Roses. 

Slash spelar numera i bandet Velvet Revolver med tvÃ¥ andra fÃ¶re detta Guns N' Roses-medlemmar, basisten Duff McKagan och trummisen Matt Sorum. Velvet Revolver bestÃ¥r ocksÃ¥ av gitarristen Dave Kushner. Bandet har kommit ut med tvÃ¥ skivor: ''Contraband'' (2004) och ''Libertad'' (2007). Contraband sÃ¥lde platina tvÃ¥ gÃ¥nger i USA.

Debutalbumet ''Appetite for Destruction'' med Guns N' Roses blev en stor succÃ© med lÃ¥tar som ''Paradise City'', ''Welcome to the Jungle'' och ''Sweet Child O'Mine''. NÃ¤r Slash och sÃ¥ngaren Axl Rose hade olika syn pÃ¥ vad fÃ¶r musik Guns N' Roses skulle spela pÃ¥ kommande plattor, valde Slash att hoppa av gruppen 1996. Det mÃ¤rks tydligt pÃ¥ skivan "Ain't Life Grand" som Slash slÃ¤pper 2000 att bluesen tar Ã¶ver.

Innan Velvet Revolver var Slash med i Slash's Snakepit. Gruppen slÃ¤ppte tvÃ¥ skivor ''It's five o'clock somewhere'' och ''Ain't life grand''.

Slash Ã¤r Ã¤ven med i spelet Guitar Hero III. Han Ã¤r en av bossarna som man mÃ¶ter pÃ¥ hÃ¶gre nivÃ¥er. Slash fick sitt smeknamn av en vÃ¤ns far frÃ¥n hans unga dagar. Hans vÃ¤ns fader gav honom just smeknamnet Slash fÃ¶r att han mÃ¤rkte att Slash alltid hade brÃ¥ttom eller var pÃ¥ vÃ¤g nÃ¥gonstans. 
Ãr 2007 kom Slash sjÃ¤lvbiografi ut (Harper Collins) som gick hÃ¶gt upp pÃ¥ bÃ¤stsÃ¤ljarlistan. Boken kommer ut pÃ¥ svenska under 2008 (BTM Books)
