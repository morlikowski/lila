'''John Winston Howard''' (australiano, 25º primeiro-ministro de seu país, cargo que assumiu em 11 de março de 1996 e deixou em 3 de dezembro de 2007

Seu governo foi subsequentemente reeleito nas eleições de Parlamento australiano a partir de julho de 2005. Howard é um entusiasta do críquete e um grande torcedor da Seleção Australiana de Rugby.

Em 24 de novembro de 2007, foram realizadas novas eleições parlamentárias na Austrália, onde o governo liberal de Howard foi derrotado pelos trabalhistas, comandados por Kevin Rudd, após perder surpreendentes 24 assentos no Parlamento.

==Biografia==
Howard cresceu em Earlwood, subúrbio de Sydney, onde estudou em escola pública. O seu segundo nome, Winston, é uma homenagem a Winston Churchill, mas era conhecido na família como ''Jack''. Seu pai, Lyell Howard e seu avô paterno, Walter Howard, veteranos da  Força Imperial Australiana na Primeira Guerra Mundial foram donos de um posto de gasolina e uma oficina em Dulwich Hill, onde Howard trabalhou como aprendiz. Além do posto e da oficina, o pai e o avô de Howard controlaram uma grande área de terra na Papua-Nova Guiné que foi oferecida pelos serviços prestados à Austrália na II Guerra Mundial. Durante sua adolescência, John e seus três irmãos perderam seu pai, sendo então criados por sua mãe.
Ele estudou e se graduou em Partido Liberal em 1957.

===Vida política===
Em 1967 foi candidato à vaga do subúrbio de Drummoyne que na época pertencia ao Partido Trabalhista Australiano (ALP). Nas eleições de fevereiro de 1968, Howard acabou sendo derrotado pelo candidato do ALP.
Howard continuou a morar na casa de sua mãe até 1971 quando se casou com a colega de partido Janette Parker, com quem teve três filhos.
Ele tentou novamente entrar no Parlamento Australiano num nível federal e obteve sucesso. Foi eleito para a Casa dos Representantes como membro do Parlamento representando o subúrbio de Bennelong em Sydney nas eleições federais de maio de 1974. Quando o Governo Fraser chegou ao poder em dezembro de 1975, Howard foi indicado como Ministro da Economia e de Assuntos do Consumidor. Em dezembro de 1977, foi indicado como Tesoureiro aos 38 anos de idade, sendo conhecido como o "garoto Tesoureiro". Em abril de 1982, foi eleito líder do Partido Liberal.

Durante o período como tesoureiro, Howard se tornou adepto ao tatcherismo (também conhecido como "racionalismo econômico" na Austrália). 

Após a renúncia de Fraser, Howard tentou ser líder novamente do Partido Liberal, mas foi derrotado por Andrew Peacock. Continuou como deputado-líder e tornou-se deputado-líder da Oposição.

===Primeiro-ministro===

Com o eleitorado ainda sofrendo com reformas, uma recessão, Howard ganhou de diversos trabalhistas, e marcou uma vitória suave nas eleições de 1996 sobre Keating tornando-se o primeiro-ministro da Austrália, aos 56 anos de idade.

'''John Winston Howard''' <small>AC</small> (born Sir Robert Menzies.

Howard was a member of the 1974 to 2007, representing the Treasurer in the government of Coalition Opposition from 1985–1989, which included the 1987 federal election against Bob Hawke. He was re-elected as Leader of the Opposition in 1995.

Howard led the Liberal-National Coalition to victory at the 1996 federal election, defeating Labor government and ending a record 13 years of Coalition opposition. Howard was sworn in as Prime Minister on 1998, 2001 and 2004 elections. Major issues for the Howard Government were taxation, industrial relations, immigration, the Iraq war, and aboriginal relations.

Howard was defeated at the 2007 election by Labor's Maxine McKew, making him the second Australian Prime Minister, after Stanley Bruce in 1929, to lose his own seat. The Coalition also lost government at the same election to the Australian Labor Party led by Kevin Rudd.

==Early life==
left|thumb|upright|150px|John Howard as a boy
John Howard is the fourth son of Lyall Howard and Mona (''née'' Kell). His parents were married in 1925. His eldest brother Stanley was born in 1926, followed by Walter in 1929, and Robert (Bob) in 1936. Lyall Howard was an admirer of Winston Churchill,<ref name="True_Believer"></ref> and a sympathiser with the New Guard.<ref name="van_Onselen"></ref>

Howard grew up in the Earlwood. His mother had been an office worker until her marriage. His father and his paternal grandfather, Walter Howard, were both veterans of the First AIF in World War I. They also ran two Dulwich Hill petrol stations where John Howard worked as a boy.<ref name="SMH_Petrol"></ref>
Lyall Howard died in 1955 when John was sixteen, leaving his mother to take care of John<ref>Birnbauer, Bill, "Rise Of A Common Man", ''The Age'', 4 March 1996</ref> (or "Jack" as he was also known).<ref name="Canterbury"></ref>

Howard suffered a hearing impairment in his youth, leaving him with a slight speech impediment.<ref name="transcript-lab_opening"></ref> It also influenced him in subtle ways, limiting his early academic performance; encouraging a reliance on an excellent memory; and in his mind ruling out becoming a Van Onselen, Peter (2007).

Howard married fellow Liberal Party member Janette Parker in 1971, with whom he had three children: Melanie (1974), Tim (1977) and Richard (1980).<ref name="NAA_JanetteHoward"> </ref>

==Entry into politics ==

At the 1963 federal election, Howard acted as campaign manager in his local seat of Parkes for the successful candidacy of Tom Hughes who defeated the 20 year Labor incumbent.

In 1967 with the support of party power brokers, John Carrick and Drummoyne, held by the ALP. Howard's mother sold the family home in Earlwood and rented a house with him at Five Dock, a suburb within the electorate. At the election in February 1968, in which the incumbent state Liberal government was returned to office, Howard failed to defeat the sitting member, despite campaigning vigorously.<ref name='Drummoyne_1968'> 1968 | publisher=Parliament of NSW | date= 25 July 2007 | accessdate=2007-07-25 }}</ref> Howard and his mother subsequently returned to Earlwood, moving to a house on the same street where he grew up.

==Member of Parliament==
At the 1974 federal election, Howard successfully contested the Sydney suburban seat of Bennelong and became a Member of Parliament in the House of Representatives. When Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, a position in which he served until 1977.<ref name="NMA"/>

==Federal Treasurer (1977–1983)==

In December 1977, at the age of 38, Howard was appointed Treasurer, for which he became known as "the boy Treasurer".<ref name="NMA"/> In this role, he was a strong adherent of government-owned enterprises.

In 1979, Treasurer Howard established a committee of inquiry, the Campbell Committee, to investigate financial system reforms. The process of reform began before the Committee reported 2 1/2 years later, with the introduction of the tender system for the sale of Treasury notes in 1979, and Treasury bonds in 1982. Ian Macfarlane (Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia 1996-2006) described these reforms as "second only in importance to the float of the Australian dollar in 1983." <ref>http://www.abc.net.au/rn/boyerlectures/stories/2006/1769925.htm</ref>

In April 1982, Howard was elected Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party.

During Howard's tenure as Treasurer, the 90-day cash rate peaked at 21% on 8 April 1982, while home loan mortage rates were capped at 13.5%, and inflation peaked at 12.5% in September 1982.<ref></ref> Peter Costello commented, in 2007, that "The Howard treasurership was not a success in terms of interest rates and inflation... he had not been a great reformer."<ref name="smh_treasurer"></ref>

==Opposition years (1983-1996)==
Following the 1983 defeat of the Fraser government and Fraser's subsequent resignation from parliament, Howard contested the Liberal leadership but was defeated by Opposition. After electoral defeat by Hawke and Labor at the 1984 election, Peacock sought, in September 1985, to replace Howard with John Moore as Deputy Leader. The party room re-elected Howard to the position. Peacock resigned and Howard became Opposition Leader unopposed on 3 September.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/05/1078464638831.html Howard's labours are slipping away], Alan Ramsay, ''Sydney Morning Herald'', March 6 2004</ref>

Howard came to be known as an economic liberal in his own words, an "economic radical" yet an avowed social conservative.<ref name=markus89></ref> He opposed "national identity. In July 1986, Howard famously said that "The times will suit me".<ref name='SMH20030818_TimesDoSuitHim'>{{ cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/17/1061059710322.html?from=storyrhs
|title=The sad times do suit him; he made them|first =Anne |last = Summers|publisher =''Sydney Morning Herald''|date=18 August 2003}}</ref> However, his chances of unseating Hawke at the 1987 election were ruined when the arch-conservative Premier of Queensland Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen launched a populist "Joh for Canberra" campaign that divided the federal conservative political movement and saw Hawke comfortably re-elected.

On One Australia''. The policy detailed a vision of "one nation and one future", including opposition to multiculturalism and rejection of Aboriginal land rights.<ref name=markus85></ref> Howard's comments that same month about Asian immigration led to controversy and divisions within the Liberal Party:  in the eyes of some in the community that it's too great, it would be in our immediate-term interest and supporting of social cohesion if it were slowed down a little, so the capacity of the community to absorb it was greater".<ref name="Aus_spice"></ref>}}

Other members of Howard's coalition, including Shadow Finance Minister John Stone and Deputy Opposition Leader Ian Sinclair also spoke out about Asian immigration, suggesting it must be reduced.<ref name=markus89/><ref name="Borderline"></ref>

On motion stating that no Australian government would use race or ethnic origin as a criterion for immigration. Four members of the Liberal Party crossed the floor of parliament to vote with Labor: Hon Dr Peter Baume (Senator), Ian Wilson and Michael MacKellar abstained from the vote.<ref name="PKelly_EndOfCertainty1994">{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Kelly (journalist)|title=The End of Certainty: Power, Politics, and Business in Australia

In September 1988, Howard elaborated his opposition to multiculturalism by saying ''"To me, multiculturalism suggests that we can't make up our minds who we are or what we believe in."''<ref name=markus85/> He rejected the idea of an Aboriginal treaty as ''"repugnant to the ideals of One Australia"''<ref name="markus85"/> and commented ''"I don't think it is wrong, racist, immoral or anything, for a country to say 'we will decide what the cultural identity and the cultural destiny of this country will be and nobody else."''<ref name="SMH_cricket"></ref>

Dissent within the Liberal Party over Asian immigration was believed by some political commentators to have weakened Howard's leadership.<ref name="PKelly_EndOfCertainty1994"/> In February 1989, John Elliott approached Andrew Peacock and encouraged Peacock to launch a leadership challenge against Howard.<ref name="PKelly_EndOfCertainty1994"/> In May 1989, Peacock launched a surprise leadership coup, ousting Howard as Liberal leader. When asked that day whether he could become Liberal leader again, Howard famously likened it to ''"Lazarus with a triple bypass"''.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/02/28/1077677011993.html Thoughts of a bypassed Lazarus], The Age, February 29 2004</ref>

The loss of the Liberal Party leadership to Peacock deeply affected Howard, who admitted he would occasionally drink too much. <ref name="news_drunk"></ref> After time on the Coalition 1990 election loss, Peacock was replaced with former Howard staffer Dr. John Hewson.

Howard was a supporter of Hewson's economic program, with a Goods and Services Tax (GST) as its centrepiece. After Hewson lost the "unloseable" 1993 election to Paul Keating, Howard unsuccessfully challenged Hewson for the leadership. In 1994, he was again passed over for the leadership, which went to Alexander Downer. Downer failed to dent Keating's dominance and, in January 1995, he resigned as leader. Peter Costello, deputy party leader, did not challenge for the leadership, over a decade later citing an agreement between the pair that allowed Howard to become leader for a second time unopposed. Howard said no deal had ever been made. <ref name="SMH meeting"></ref>

==Prime Minister==

As Opposition Leader for the second time, Howard revised his earlier statements against Medicare and  Asian immigration.<ref name="Aus_spice"></ref> During the campaign Howard outlined his vision of Australia in 2000 to the ABC:

Following Howard's election to Opposition Leader, the Coalition opened a large lead over Labor in most opinion polls, and Howard overtook Keating as preferred Prime Minister. Referring to the failed Goods and Services Tax (GST), Howard said:

Winning over many traditional Labor voters, a group termed the "Howard battlers", Howard won a sweeping victory at the 1996 elections, with a 26-seat swing--the second-largest defeat of an incumbent government since Federation.  At the age of 56, he was sworn in as Prime Minister on Coalition opposition.<ref name="NMA"></ref>

In the run-up to the election, Oxley in Queensland was disendorsed because of comments she made to ''The Queensland Times''. Howard said:</ref>}}

The seat of Bennelong became home to many Asian immigrants, and in May 2002, Howard retracted his 1988 comments about Asian immigration:<blockquote>My instinct is that Asian-Australians are very much part of the community now.  I think it (their integration) has been quicker.  I just don't hear people talking about it now, even as much as they did five years ago, and I have an electorate which is very Asian.<ref name="Aus_spice"/></blockquote>

Throughout 2002 and 2003 he kept his lead in the opinion polls over Labor leader, Simon Crean.

On 29 August 2004, Howard called an election for 9 October.  The Labor opposition, after the resignation of Simon Crean and the election of Mark Latham as leader in December 2003, had established a large lead in some opinion polls by March 2004, and the government entered the election campaign behind Labor in all published national opinion polls.  Howard himself still had a large lead over Latham as preferred Prime Minister in those same polls and most commentators regarded the result as being too close to call.

During the campaign, Howard attacked Latham's economic record as Liverpool City Council.  Howard also attacked Labor's economic history.</ref>}}

The election result was an increased Coalition majority in the House of Representatives and the first, albeit slim, government majority in the Senate since 1981. On a two party preferred basis, the Coalition achieved 52.74% of the vote to Labor's 47.26%.  However, for the second time since becoming Prime Minister, Howard himself had to go to preferences in order to win another term in his own seat.  He took 49.9 percent of the first count and was only assured of reelection on the third count.  Ultimately, Howard won 53.3 percent of the two-party preferred vote.<ref>http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/2004/2004repsnsw.txt</ref>

On 21 December 2004, Howard became the second-longest serving Australian Prime Minister after Sir Robert Menzies.<ref name="ABC_favourite"></ref> The new Senate came into effect on 1 July 2005, giving a government control of both houses for the first time since the Fraser government.

Howard chaired APEC Economic Leaders Meeting in Sydney during September.<ref name='DPMC_APEC2007'>  </ref> The meeting was at times overshadowed by leadership speculation following further poor poll results<ref> {{cite news|title = Leadership talk dogs PM|date= publisher = [[The Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC|url =http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/07/2026860.htm

The Coalition trailed Labor in opinion polls from mid-2006 onward, but Howard still consistently led Labor leader Kim Beazley on the question of preferred Prime Minister.  In December 2006, after Kevin Rudd became Labor leader, the two-party preferred deficit widened even further and Rudd swiftly overtook Howard as preferred Prime Minister.

In April 2006, the government announced it had completely paid off the last of $96 billion of Commonwealth net debt inherited when it came to power in 1996.<ref name='CostelloSpeech200604_DebtRepaid'></ref> Economists generally welcomed the news, while cautioning that some level of debt was not necessarily bad, and that some of the debt had been transferred to the private sector.<ref name='PM_debtfreeday'>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1620425.htm |title=Costello announces 'debt free day'

It was alleged by opposition leader Kevin Rudd during their single leadership debate that Howard had no plan to deal with inflationary pressures on the economy, and would not be able to handle future interest rate rises.

==Evacuation from America during 9/11==
Howard was on an official trip to the United States at the time of the US Congress on Wednesday; the joint session address was cancelled but he sat in the gallery of the US house and was acknowledged from there. He was originally to return to Australia by commercial jet; but due to the closure of US airspace he was unable to return by those means. As a result he was flown by the US Air Force to Honolulu, from which he returned to Australia by a special Qantas flight (Qantas was given a special dispensation from the closure of US airspace to take the PM and his party back to Australia.)
