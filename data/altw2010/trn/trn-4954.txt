'''加布里埃尔·伊万·海因策'''（，）是一位後衛，現效力西甲球隊皇家马德里。

04-05年賽季裏，由於需要代表阿根廷出席雅典奧運會<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/3892619.stm Man Utd sweat on Heinze]</ref>，軒斯延遲歸隊<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/3635670.stm Heinze set for Man Utd bow]</ref>，但就有著出色的發揮，他很快成爲曼聯的主力後衛，於保頓即首開紀錄<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/3599088.stm Bolton 2-2 Man Utd]</ref>，他和比利亚雷亚尔比赛時拉傷十字韌帶<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4234188.stm Villarreal 0-0 Man Utd]</ref>，而根據醫生的第一时间檢查，估計軒斯该赛季都不能再披甲上阵<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/4248368.stm Heinze could miss rest of season]</ref>。弗格森接受訪問時証實這項消息，這位前一个赛季表現出色的後衛受伤對曼聯來說是一個壞消息。

世界盃後，一般認為軒斯會再次成為曼聯的正選左后卫，可惜赛季開始後，他依然不停受到傷病困擾，更需要和艾華爭奪正選位置。曼聯於06/07年的球季尾段傷兵滿營，其中後防更是重災區，一度同時間有三名中堅球員受傷，軒斯的上陣機會亦隨即大增，擔當著左後防或中堅位置。

由於左後防的正選位置已漸漸被艾華搶走，軒斯於2007年夏天表明希望離隊尋求更多比賽機會。由於只有利物浦出價能夠符合曼聯的要求，但曼聯卻不想將軒斯賣至爭標對手隊中，因此軒斯的經理曾揚言要告上法庭<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6900545.stm Liverpool could force Heinze move]</ref>，而曼聯方面則堅持不會將這名後防球員賣至利物浦<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6954531.stm Heinze loses bid for Anfield move]</ref>。由於盛傳離隊，他於06/07年開季被取去其 4 號球衣，改穿 14 號球衣。之後再沒有機會代表曼聯上陣比賽。

2007年8月轉會至西甲勁旅皇家馬德里<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6960108.stm Heinze & Robben seal Real switch]</ref>。

'''Gabriel Ivan Heinze''' (born Crespo, Argentine footballer of Real Madrid as a left-back.

== Club career ==
=== Early career ===
Heinze began his career in his home country with Sporting in Portugal, though he would return and spend a further two years in Spain. 

===Paris Saint-Germain===
At the close of the 2001 season, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain and here he enjoyed more than 119 appearances and 19 goals in the three years he stayed, winning the French Cup in 2004.

In June 2004, Heinze joined Manchester United for a fee of £6.9m.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/3735065.stm BBC SPORT | Football | My Club | Man Utd | Man Utd secure Heinze deal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== Manchester United ===
He marked his debut for United in September 2004 with a goal in a 2&ndash;2 draw against Bolton Wanderers and immediately established himself as United's first choice left-back. Heinze's play was regularly lauded by United fans with the familiar chant of ''"Ar-gen-tina!"''<ref></ref> Heinze was voted Manchester United fans' player of the year for the 2004&ndash;05 season, becoming the first South American player to win the award.<ref></ref>

Heinze was injured in a Villarreal on 2005&ndash;06 season. He made a comeback with the reserve team in April 2006, but a minor injury picked up in his third game back prevented him making a first-team appearance before the end of the campaign, and this appeared to have ended his chances of representing Argentina in the 2006 World Cup in Germany. However, national coach José Pekerman called Heinze up into his 23-man squad for the finals. The long term consequence of Heinze's injury was that Manchester United had recruited Patrice Evra as Heinze's replacement at left back and, after Heinze's return from injury, he was unable consistently to retain the left back position. Unwilling to be merely a squad player Heinze sought guaranteed first team  football elsewhere.

Heinze's last season with Manchester United was the 2006&ndash;07 season. He scored his first goal of the season in the Reading, in a 3&ndash;2 win to United on Chelsea,<ref></ref> and at home to West Ham.

On Liverpool was rejected by United. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2317323/Liverpool%27s-Gabriel-Heinze-bid-rejected.html]

===Real Madrid===
On Raúl. Intermittently troubled by injury and playing out of position in the center of defence, Heinze has nevertheless made a significant impact on Real Madrid's 2007-8 campaign in which he helped the club win La Liga in his debut season in the Spanish capital.

==International career==
In total, Heinze has won 40 caps for Argentina, first representing them in April 2003 against Libya.<ref></ref> His late arrival can be somewhat attributed to his leaving Argentina before establishing himself as a player. He won a gold medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics football tournament with the Argentine team.

He appeared in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, following an injury earlier that year.  Argentina made it through to the quarter-finals, but were unable to capitalize on their 1&ndash;0 lead, and Germany equalized with just minutes to go to take it to extra-time and penalties. Heinze did not take a penalty, but could only sit in tears as Jens Lehmann saved Roberto Ayala and Esteban Cambiasso's penalties.<ref></ref>

He played for Argentina in Mexico helping his team win 3&ndash;0<ref></ref> and continuing to the final match loss against Brazil.
