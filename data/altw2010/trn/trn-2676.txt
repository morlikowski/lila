'''Torbay''' () is an east-facing bay and natural harbour, at the western most end of Lyme Bay in the south-west of England, situated roughly midway between the cities of Exeter and Plymouth. Historically part of the county of Devon, Torbay was made a unitary authority on April 1, 1998. Tourist authorities call it the English Riviera on account of its beaches and mild climate; it is a popular area with holiday makers.

==Geography==
There are three main towns around the bay: Galmpton.

Torbay, as an administrative area, was created in 1968 as a County Borough, from the amalgamation of the Boroughs of Torquay, Paignton and Brixham. In October 2005 Torbay became the first area of the South West to have an elected Mayor with Nick Bye being the successful candidate.

The southern limit of Torbay is Oddicombe and Babbacombe can be found; these are noted for their interesting Breccia cliffs.

Torbay is bordered by the Dartmouth in the South Hams Newton Abbot and Teignmouth in Teignbridge.

Because of the mild climate, Torbay palm trees are a common sight along the coast. However, this 'palm' is in fact a cabbage tree (''Cordyline australis''), originating from New Zealand. These trees flourish elsewhere in the UK. It is suggested that the popularity of cabbage trees in Torbay is attributable to their first being introduced to the UK in that region.

The area has a large number of English.

The fishing port of Brixham is home to one of England and Wales's most successful fishing fleets and regularly lands more value than any UK port outside of Scotland.

Torbay's many geological features have led to the establishment of the English Riviera Geopark, one of 53 geoparks worldwide; as of July 2008, this is the sole urban geopark.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/09/17/torbay_geopark_status_feature.shtml Global status for Torbay] (retried 7 July 2008)</ref>

==Transport==
Torbay has three stations on the National Rail network:
* Torre railway station is inland on the road from Torquay to Newton Abbot
* Torquay railway station is close to Torre Abbey Sands.
* Paignton railway station serves that town and links with the heritage railway via the Dart ferry to Kingswear.

'''Torbay''' ist eine selbständige Gebietskörperschaft (Unitary Authority) an der westlichen Seite der Lyme Bay im Südwesten Englands. 

Torbay war bis 1997 ein Distrikt der Grafschaft Devon, ist aber heute selbständig und gehört zur Region South West England. Zu Torbay gehören neben mehreren kleineren Ortschaften vor allem die drei Städte Torquay im Norden, Paignton in der Mitte und Brixham im Süden. 

Torbay wird auch ''The English Riviera'' („die '''Englische Riviera'''“) genannt.
