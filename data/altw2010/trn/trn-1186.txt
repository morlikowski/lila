The '''Neckar''' is a 367-km long state of River Rhine, which it joins at Esslingen, Marbach, Heilbronn and Heidelberg, before discharging into the Rhine at Mannheim (at 95 m above sea level). 

Along its valley in the Odenwald hills, many castles can be found, like Burg Hornberg and Burg Guttenberg in Haßmersheim, but also the closed Obrigheim Nuclear Power Plant. After passing Heidelberg, the Neckar discharges on average 145 m³/s of water into the Rhine, which makes the Neckar its 4th largest tributary, and the 10th largest river in Germany.

The name ''Neckar'' was derived via ''Nicarus'' und ''Neccarus'' from Celtic ''Nikros'', meaning ''wild water'' or ''wild fellow''. Since about 1100, Black Forest wood was transported by timber rafting, e.g. to Holland for the use in shipyards.

During the 19th century, traditional horse-drawn boats were replaced by steam boats that used a 155-km long chain in the river to pull themselves upstream. The railway made it possible to transport timber to the port of Heilbronn, limiting timber rafting to the lower part of the Neckar after 1899. Thanks to the construction of 11 locks, ships up to 1500t could travel to Heilbronn in 1935.

By 1968, the last of 27 locks, at Fils joins, and where the Neckar bends, taking a Northwestern instead of a Northeastern direction. Other important ports include Stuttgart, Heilbronn and Mannheim.

The river's course provides a popular route for cyclists, especially during the summer months. Its steep valley sides are used as vineyards, to cultivate mainly Trollinger.
