'''Hunter College of the City University of New York'''  is a senior college of the City University of New York (CUNY), located on Manhattan's Upper East Side.  Originally known as the Normal College, Hunter was founded in 1870 by Irish immigrant and social reformer Thomas Hunter as a teacher-training school for young women.<ref>Hunter College 2007-2010 Undergraduate Catalog, p.3</ref> Today, Hunter is a coeducational liberal arts and sciences college that offers undergraduate and graduate programs in more than 100 fields.<ref>http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/academics/index.shtml, "Academics at Hunter", 1/4/08</ref> The college is organized into four schools: The School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Education, the School of the Health Professions, and the School of Social Work.<ref>Hunter College 2007-2010 Undergraduate Catalog, p.3 </ref>

== History ==
===Founding===
thumb|left|300px|Thomas Hunter Hall, on Lexington Avenue, with the North Building in the backgroundHunter College has its origins in the nineteenth-century movement for Thomas Hunter, who was president of the school during the first 37 years, it was originally a women's college for training teachers. The school, which was housed in an armory and saddle store at Broadway and East Fourth Street in Manhattan, was open to all qualified women, irrespective of race, religion or ethnic background, which was incongruent to the prevailing admission practices of other schools during this era. Created by the New York State Legislature, Hunter was deemed the only approved institution for those seeking to teach in New York City during this time. The school incorporated an elementary and high school for high school still exist at a different location, and are now called the Hunter College Campus Schools.)

During Thomas Hunter's tenure as president of the school, Hunter became known for its impartiality regarding race, religion, ethnicity, financial or political favoritism; its pursuit of higher education for women; its high entry requirements; and its rigorous academics. The college's student population quickly expanded, and the college subsequently moved uptown, into a new Gothic structure, now known as Thomas Hunter Hall, on Lexington Avenue between 68th and 69th Streets.

In 1888 the school was incorporated as a college under the statutes of New York State, with the power to confer the degree of A.B. This led to the separation of the school into two "camps": the "Normals", who pursued a four-year course of study to become licensed teachers, and the "Academics", who sought non-teaching professions and the Bachelor of Arts degree. After 1902 when the "Normal" course of study was abolished, the "Academic" course became standard across the student body.

===Expansion===
In 1914 the Normal College became Hunter College in honor of its first president. At the same time, the college was experiencing a period of great expansion as increasing student enrollments necessitated more space. The college reacted by establishing branches in the boroughs of Queens, and City College's Brooklyn campus, and the two were spun off to form Brooklyn College.

The late 1930s saw the construction of Hunter College in the Bronx (later known as the Bronx Campus). During the Second World War, Hunter leased the Bronx Campus buildings to the United States Navy who used the facilities to train 95,000 women volunteers for military service as WAVES and SPARS.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/extContent/usmc/pcn-190-003129-00/sec4.htm Free A Marine to Fight: Women Marines in World War II (Early Training: Holyoke and Hunter)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> When the Navy vacated the campus, the site was briefly occupied by the nascent United Nations, which held its first Security Council sessions at the Bronx Campus in 1946, giving the school an international profile.<ref>[http://www.lehman.edu/lehman/programs/grad/187.htm History of Lehman College]</ref>

In 1943, President and First Lady. Today it is known as Roosevelt House and is undergoing renovation to become an academic center.

===The CUNY Era===
Hunter became the women's college of the municipal system, and in the 1950s, when City College became coeducational, Hunter started admitting men to its Bronx campus. In 1964, the Manhattan campus began admitting men also. The Bronx campus subsequently became Lehman College in 1968.

In 1968-1969, Black and Puerto Rican students struggled to get a department that would teach about their history and experience. These and supportive students and faculty expressed this demand through building take-overs, rallies, etc. In Spring 1969, Hunter College established Black and Puerto Rican Studies (now called Africana/Puerto Rican and Latino Studies). An "open admissions" policy initiated in 1970 by the City University of New York opened the school's doors to historically underrepresented groups by guaranteeing a college education to any and all who graduated from NYC high schools. Many African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Puerto Ricans, and students from the developing world made their presence felt at Hunter, and even after the end of "open admissions" still comprise a large part of the school's student body. As a result of the this increase in enrollment, Hunter opened new buildings on Lexington Avenue during the early 1980s. In further advancing Puerto Rican studies, Hunter became home to the Centro de Estudios Puertorriqueños ("Center for Puerto Rican Studies" or simply "Centro") in 1982.

Today, Hunter College is a comprehensive teaching and research institution. Of the more than 20,000 students enrolled at Hunter, nearly 5,000 are enrolled in a graduate program, the most popular of which are education and social work. Although less than 28% of students are the first in their families to attend college, the college maintains its tradition of concern for women's education, with nearly three out of four students being female. In 2006, Hunter became home to the Bella Abzug Leadership Institute, which will run training programs for young women to build their leadership, public speaking, business and advocacy skills. Princeton Review named the college as [http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/news/#bestvalue one of America's "Best Value" Colleges] in its 2007 guide.

In recent years, the college has integrated its undergraduate and graduate programs to successfully make advanced programs in fields such as (Psychology and Biology) - "Ph.D Program", (Education) - "Master's Program", (Mathematics) - "Master's Program", -"Ph.D Program"(Biology & Chemistry) - "Biochemistry", (Accounting) - "Master's Program" along with the highly competitive (Economics) - "Master's Program" to which only a select few students may enter based on excellent scholarship and performance, and less than half will earn a Master's Degree by maintaining a nearly perfect academic record and performing thesis research.

Although far from the polar regions, Hunter is a member institution of the University of the Arctic, a network of schools providing education accessible to northern students.<ref>[http://www.uarctic.org/orgs2full.aspx?group=GOvCouncil&title=Council&m=79 University of the Arctic - MEMBERS - LIST OF MEMBERS]</ref>

'''ニューヨーク市立大学ハンター校''' ('''ニューヨークしりつだいがくハンターこう Hunter College of The City University of New York''') は、アメリカ合衆国ニューヨーク州ニューヨーク市マンハッタン区にある都市型公立総合大学である。ニューヨーク市立大学システムの一つ。一般に「'''ハンターカレッジ'''」又は「'''ハンター'''」と呼ばれ、主に教育学や、衛生学、看護学、社会福祉学などの学部が著名。

== キャンパス ==
大学の中核は、マンハッタン区の最高級住宅街であるアッパー・イースト・サイドの68丁目のレキシントン街に位置する。
ニューヨーク市地下鉄に直結した三つの近代的なビルがそのメインキャンパスであり、それらのビルは連絡通路によって相互に行き来可能である。

== 歴史 ==
ハンターカレッジは、1870年創立。アメリカ合衆国で最も古い公立大学の一つである。19世紀当時、アメリカ合衆国を席巻していた師範学校創設の流れにその起源を持つ。校訓は"mihi cura futuri"「将来の心積もりはわが手にあり」。

アイルランド系移民であるトマス・ハンターによって、女子師範高等学校が創立されたのが今日のハンターカレッジの前身であるが、当初は、教員を養成するための女子学校であった。
ニューヨーク州議会によって正式認可され、19世紀後半には、ニューヨーク州において教育者を志す若者のための唯一の師範学校となった。
学校は、能力の秀でた子供たちのための小学校、中高一貫の高等学校を組織の一部に組み入れ、子供たちはそこで教育者になるための訓練を受けたのである。1887年には、幼稚園も併設された。
現在でも、小学校と高等学校は別の場所に存在し、ハンターカレッジ付属高等学校は全米でも有数のエリート校となっている。

トマス・ハンターが学校の初代総長であった間に、ハンターはカレッジは、人種、宗教、民族、経営、政治的な選好に関する中立性、女性に対する高い教育の追求、入学の難度、厳格な研究活動で知られるようになった。
大学の学生人口は飛躍的に拡大し、大学は、ミッドタウン東部に新設されたゴシック建築に、その所在を移したのである。

1888年に、学校はニューヨーク州の制定法に基づき、大学として法人化された。
このことは、学校を二つのキャンパスに分離させるという結果を導いた。
「師範」コースは、州で認可された教員になるための実践的なプログラムであり、「研究者養成」コースは、非教育的職業、または学士号の取得を志す人のためのプログラムとなった。
しかし、1902年に師範コースが排除されて以降、「研究者養成」コースが標準となった。
