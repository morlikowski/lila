Next to Like a Stone, it is considered the band's most well known song, and is still played on radio stations world wide.

It is the theme of the ''2005 RAW Diva Search'' which was held by Scrubs'' season six premiere episode "My Mirror Image". New York Mets' outfielder Shawn Green also used the song before his at-bats at games in 2006.

There was a contest held by ContactMusic.com in which fans of the band could submit their pictures, over two dozen of which were selected and featured on the 7" Vinyl release of the single.
