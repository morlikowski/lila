'''扬·斯坦尼斯拉夫·弗朗西斯泽克·切尔斯基'''（Jan Stanisław Franciszek Czerski，），俄国名字为'''伊万·德米特里维奇·切尔斯基'''（Иван Дементьевич Черский），波兰探险家。

切尔斯基出生于一个具有维尔纳参加了反抗俄国统治的一月起义。起义失败后，切尔斯基被捕，在被削去贵族称号并剥夺全部领地后，他被流放至黑龙江边的布拉戈维申斯克（海兰泡）。在途中，他被转送至鄂木斯克附近的一个劳改营。

在劳改营，切尔斯基结识了一批波兰和俄国学者，从他们那里得到了一些关于西伯利亚自然研究的书籍，出于对这片土地的热爱，他于是积极学习，开始在营地周边进行一些探险活动。

1869年，切尔斯基的服役期满，但是他并没有获得回到波兰的许可，同样也无法进入大学学习。他的论文被禁止发表，俄罗斯地理协会也拒绝了他的加入申请。切尔斯基于是坚持在鄂木斯克居住了下来，以当教师为生。

1871年，切尔斯基获准移居伊尔库茨克，在当地找到一份博物馆工作。在其他波兰爱国者的帮助下，切尔斯基得以加入俄罗斯地理协会，从而能够获得资金支持进行探险活动。他是第一位绘制出贝加尔湖沿岸地图的人，三次获得俄罗斯地理协会颁发的金质奖章。

1883年，切尔斯基被俄国政府赦免，他的贵族身份也被恢复，1886年他移居圣彼得堡，其后他又多次率领探险队前往西伯利亚探险。1892年他在一次对奥莫隆河进行的探险中去世。

==Biography==
Son of Dominik and Xenia Czerski, a family of Lithuanian and Belarusian nobles (partitioned Lithuania, then Vilna (in ''Instytut Szlachecki'') he took part in the exiled to Siberia (to Blagoveshchensk near Amur River) by the Russian authorities. He never made it to Blagoveshchensk, and was detached to serve in the formation near Omsk. During that time he was taken in by some other Poles (Marczewski, Kwiatkowski)  living in exile in Omsk region, as well as Russian geographer, Grigory Nikolayevich Potanin. With their help he became interested in the natural history of the region. They provided him with literature on Siberia and natural sciences, and during his free time he self-educated himself and carried out his first research.

After release from army in 1869 he did not receive permission to return home, becoming a political exilee; he was refused the right to enter a university; his publications were rejected and his first attempt to enter the Russian Geographical Society was rejected. For the next two years he was forced to work as a teacher in Omsk, as he was denied the right to leave the area.

In 1871 he received a permission to move to geomorphological evolution theory. 

In 1878 he married Marfa Pavlovna Ivanova, a native of Siberia region. In 1883 he was pardoned by the Russian government, and later he regained his noble status. He lived in Yana, Indigirka and Kolyma basins. He collected and cataloged over 2,500 of ancient bones, publishing in 1888 a large work on Quaternary Period mammals followed by an even larger work on the Siberian mammals relics in 1891.

He died in Kolyma, Yana and Indigirka Rivers. He was buried near the Omolon River.

His name was given to several landmarks in Siberia, including the Chersky Mountain Range and the settlement of Chersky in the Sakha Republic, another mountain range similarly named in Chita Oblast, the Chersky Mountain - highest peak (2572 m) of the Baikal Range, Chersky Peak (2090 m) - one of the highest peaks of the Chamar-Daban Range, Chersky Pass in the same mountains, Chersky Stone (728 m) - a peak in near Listvyanka, Chersky Valley and Chersky Plateau in the Sayan Mountains, a waterfall near the Baikal Lake, an inactive volcano in the Tunkinsk Valley, and Chersky Place - an archeological site near Irkutsk where ancient human remains were discovered. Three species were named after him: Osteolepis Tscherskii (fish), Leperditia Czerskii (crustacean) and Polyptchites Tscherskii (ammonite).
