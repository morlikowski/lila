'''Rolls-Royce V8''' är en brittiska biltillverkaren Rolls-Royce mellan 1905 och 1906.

Rolls-Royce tog fram en sekelskiftet 1900. För att motverka de oljud och vibrationer som kännetecknade tidiga sidventilsmotor, i det här fallet en liten pargjutna cylindrar, monterade i 120º vinkel mellan blocken.

Två stadsbilar byggdes, med hästvagns-liknande passagerarna.

The '''Rolls-Royce V-8''' was a car produced by Rolls-Royce in 1905 intended to compete with the then popular electric cars used in towns.

Claude Johnson, business partner of C. S. Rolls suggested there would be a market for an internal combustion engined car that could take on the electric car market. To do this it would have to be silent, free of vibration and smoke free.  The engine would also have to be mounted under the car to give the appearance of a town V-8.<ref name=Bird&Hallows /> To reduce fumes the then common drip lubrication was replaced by a pressure system. The power also seems to have been limited to maximise smooth running.<ref name=RRManchester/>

Two body styles were proposed, a Landaulet par Excellence to attack the town electric market and the Legalimit which was governed so as not to allow the then United Kingdom speed limit of 20&nbsp;mph (32&nbsp;km/h) to be exceeded. The Legalimit had the engine conventionally mounted at the front but under a very low bonnet.  Only one example of the V-8 was sold, a Legalimit (chassis number 40518) to Sir Alfred Hamsworth.  This was later taken back by the factory. All three cars then seem to have been used as works cars or for customer visits.  Rolls ordered three more chassis for delivery in 1906 but there is no evidence these were ever made.<ref name=RRManchester/>

Although the car cannot be judged as being a success, lessons were learned from the engine design that were later used on the six cylinder models that made the Rolls-Royce name.
