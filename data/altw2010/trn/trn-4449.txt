'''高山滑雪'''是其中一項於高山上進行的冬季運動項目，當中設有10個小項，都為個人賽。比賽時，運動員需穿上有襯墊的運動服，並在心口的位置佩戴號碼布、戴崆保護盔、穿上滑雪板、滑雪杖以及使用「脫離式固定器」。

==歷史==
高山滑雪與其它冬季運動項目有所不同，它並非起源於歐、美等地。從此為後，高山滑雪就流行起來。

現代的高山滑雪是於德國加米施-帕騰基興冬季奧運中被列入比賽項目之一，當時只有男子和女子個人的混合式滑雪兩個小項，之後在第6屆冬季奧運中加入大曲道(Giant Slalom)小項，但同時把混合式滑雪列出比賽之小項中，及後在加拿大卡加利冬季奧運中再次被加入為高山滑雪的小項之一，並且新增超級大曲道(Super-G)

==冬季奧運中的高山滑雪==
由高山滑雪於1936年冬季奧運正式成為比賽項目之後，共有10個小項，當中包括了：男子滑降賽 (Downhill)、男子曲道 (Slalom)、男子大曲道、男子超級大曲道和男子混合式滑雪 (Combined)，以及女子滑降賽、女子曲道、女子大曲道、女子超級大曲道和女子混合式滑雪10個小項。
運動員要由起點出發以最快速度到達終點，時間準確至百分之一秒，若出現成績相同情況，名次可並排。

===曲道賽===

高山滑雪中的曲道賽小項設男子和女子個人賽，運動員要在兩個不同的滑道中滑行兩次，從高處(起點)向下滑。在滑行中，運動員要經過多個約0.75米，寬4至6米的旗門。

男子賽中的旗門多達55至75個，而女子運動員要經過40到60個旗門。旗門多由經色和藍色組成，運動員要交替穿插每個旗門，若運動員不經過任何一個的旗門，則會被判為「失格」，在兩次的滑行中，男子運動員要滑行140米至220米到達終點，而女子運動員則滑行120至180米，而比賽場地的坡度都為20至27度。

在兩次滑行後得到的成績會相加起來，若有運動員「失格」，總時間會被增加，而所用時間愈少，則排名愈高。

'''Alpine skiing''' (or '''downhill skiing''') is a recreational activity and sport involving sliding down snow-covered hills with long skis attached to each foot.

Alpine skiing evolved from mountain resorts to tow skiers back to the top of slopes, thus making it possible to repeatedly enjoy skiing down steep, long slopes that would be otherwise tiring to climb up. The sport is popular wherever the combination of snow, mountain slopes, and a sufficient South America Andes, and East Asia (mainly South Korea and Japan, although the popularity of skiing is increasing in China as well).

The main technical challenges faced by skiers are simply how to control the direction and speed of their descent. Typically, novice skiers use a technique called the "snowplough/snowplow" to turn and stop by pointing one or both skis inward, but more advanced skiers use more difficult but more elegant and speedier methods. One popular method of turning is called parallel turn; it involves keeping both skis parallel to each other while altering the weight distribution between them in order to turn them in any particular direction. The angle of the ski in relation to the slope (called edge angle) is also important as it determines the resistance (friction) created by the edges of the skis. Modern advanced skiing technique is dominated by "carving." To carve, a skier rolls his or her knees from side to side while keeping the upper body and hips facing down the hill, so that only the knees and feet are turned.  This method of turning allows modern skis to turn using the radial properties of the edges of the ski without skidding or slowing down, creating a smooth arc. To maintain the line of a parabolic ski, one must lean one's center of mass into the turn.

As skiers gain confidence, they may tackle steeper, longer and more uneven slopes (including off-piste and ungroomed runs) at higher speeds. In North America, the easiest ski runs are marked by green circles, and are typically fairly flat and smooth. Sometimes known as bunny slopes, they are usually groomed by specially equipped moguls, double fall lines, or gladed sections. A double black diamond is for experts only; these trails are steep, rarely groomed and often left in a completely natural state. There is no standard for these designations, however, and each ski resort determines them relative to their own terrain difficulty. So, for instance, a blue-square (mid-level) trail at one ski mountain may be markedly more difficult than a black-diamond (expert) trail at another mountain. In Europe the system is based on colour alone.  North American green circles, blue squares, black diamonds, and double blacks correspond to European green, blue, red, and black trails, respectively.

==Competitions==

Various alpine skiing competitions have developed in the freestyle.

Racing involves making fast turns around gates in an attempt to attain the fastest overall time down one or two runs of a race course.  Elite competitive skiers participate in the annual World Cup series, as well as the quadrennial Olympic Games and the biennial World Championships. Slalom (SL), giant slalom (GS), super giant slalom (super-G), and "combined" event that includes one downhill run and two slalom runs on a single day.  In 2005, the FIS (Fédération Internationale de Ski) introduced a new event to the World Cup calendar called the World Championships in Bormio, Italy.  Ski racing is controlled by a set of rules which are enforced by FIS.  These rules include such things as regulation ski sizes, sidecuts, boot heights, binding risers and many other things which all ensure one particular skier has no advantage over another however these regulations are constantly being pushed by ski manufacturers using new technologies.  Next year (2008) these regulations are set to be changed in order to make it harder for racers to complete a race course. Some changes include increasing the minimum ski length and also the sidecut which will make the ski turn less tightly.

moguls, aerials, and sometimes "new-school" events such as halfpipe, big air, slopestyle, and skiercross.  Together with extreme skiing, new-school freestyle skiing is also sometimes known as freeskiing.  Until relatively recently, freestyle competitions also included an event called ballet, later renamed "acro-ski."

In addition to racing and freestyle, other types of alpine skiing competitions exist. One discipline administered by the FIS but not usually considered part of racing is speed skiing, in which competitors strive to achieve the highest total speed in a straight line, with no gates or turns. Numerous non-FIS competitions have emerged over the years.  More traditional events include ''gelandesprung'' jumping (ski jumping for distance on alpine equipment), and "powder 8" contests; among the more recent introductions are "big mountain" or "extreme skiing" contests, in which athletes start at the top of a mountain and ski a route down that involves wide, fast turns as well as cliff drops. The competitors are judged on the technical difficulty of their routes and any tricks they perform on the way down the hill.

=== Organization of alpine ski competition ===
Ski competition rules and scheduling are managed internationally by the International Ski Federation (FIS) based in Switzerland. Each participating nation worldwide is represented by a national association that manages the sport in that respective nation.

In the United States, alpine skiing competition is managed by the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA). The USSA organizes all levels of skiing competition from grassroots through the U.S. Ski Team and the Olympics.

=== NASTAR ===
One group involved in the organization of ski racing in the United States is NASTAR. Developed by Ski Magazine in 1968, National Standard Race, or [http://www.nastar.com NASTAR], provides many skiers with their first look at racing – and their first experience.  Many ski resorts have permanent NASTAR courses and timing equipment. To quote the organization “Our mission is simple - to provide a fun, competitive and easily accessible racing program that, through the development of a handicap system, allows racers of all ages and abilities a means to compare their race results to other competitors across the country regardless of when and where they race.”  NASTAR also employs a system where participants can compare their times to those of top U.S. Ski Team racers who serve as NASTAR pacesetters including Steven Nyman, Jimmy Cochran and Kaylin Richardson. Once a year the best NASTAR racers gather at Steamboat in Steamboat Springs, CO for the national championships.

== Ski trail ratings ==
=== North America ===
thumbnail|right|Man skiing slope overlooking [[Lake Tahoe]]
In North America, a color–shape rating system is used to indicate the difficulty of trails (otherwise known as slopes or pistes).  Australian ski slopes also share the same rating system. 

There is no governing body that assigns difficulty ratings to ski trails. Instead, ski resorts assign ratings to their own trails, marking a given trail according to its relative difficulty when compared with other trails at that resort.  As a result, identically-pitched trails at different resorts can have different ratings.  Some skiers and snowboarders may interpret this as manipulation of ratings of their slopes to appeal to as wide an audience as possible; in fact, it is an attempt by ski areas to conform to the trail rating conventions.

Although slope gradient is the primary consideration in assigning a trail rating, other factors come into play — including trail width, normal grooms the trail.

One example is a diamond overlapping a square to indicate a trail rating between a Blue Square and a Black Diamond.  Summit County, Colorado use a double diamond with an "EX" in the center to mark a trail even more difficult than a double diamond. The combination of symbols is comparatively rare at U.S. ski areas; most ski resorts stick to the standard 4-symbol progression.

Triple black diamond trails can be found in certain ski resorts, such as Black Hole in Smuggler's Notch, Vermont.
There are also unrated slopes, generally as hard as or harder than double blacks.  One such example is the Palmer Glacier on Mount Hood, Oregon.

=== Europe ===
In Europe, pistes are classified by a similar, colour-coded system, although shapes are not always used (sometimes all ratings are circles).  The ratings are:
; Green: (Spain, France, Scandinavia, UK) Learning or "Beginner" slopes.  These are usually not marked trails, but tend to be large open, gently sloping areas at the base of the ski area.
; Blue: An easy trail, similar to the North American Green Circle, and are almost always groomed, or on so shallow a slope as not to need it.
; Red: An intermediate slope.  Steeper, or narrower than a blue slope, these are usually groomed, unless the narrowness of the trail prohibits it.
; Black: An expert slope.  Steep, may or may not be groomed, or may be groomed for moguls.  "Black" can be a very wide classification, ranging from a slope marginally more difficult than a "Red" to very steep avalanche chutes like the infamous Couloirs of Courchevel.  France tends to have a higher limit between red and black.
;Orange: (Austria, Switzerland, certain other areas) Extremely difficult.
;Double-black: (Scandinavia) Extremely difficult.
; Yellow: In recent years, many resorts reclassified some black slopes to yellow slopes. This signifies a skiroute, an ungroomed and unpatrolled slope which is actually off-piste skiing in a marked area.  Famous examples are the Stockhorn area in Zermatt and the Tortin slopes in Verbier.  In Austria, skiroutes are usually marked with orange squares instead.

Alpine slope classification in Europe is less rigidly tied to slope angle than in North America.  A lower angle slope may be classified as more difficult than a steeper slope if, for instance, it is narrower and/or requires better skiing ability to carry speed through flatter sections while controlling speed through sharp hairpin turns, off-camber slope angles or exposed rock.
