'''Alexzandra Spencer Johnson''' (born November 4, 1986) is a Canadian actress and singer/songwriter known for her roles in ''Final Destination 3'' and So Weird, and for playing the lead role of Jude Harrison in the hit teen drama series ''Instant Star'' where her performances have twice been nominated for a Gemini Award (Canadian equivalent of an Emmy Award).<ref>[http://www.geminiawards.ca/gemini22/main.cfm 22nd Annual Gemini Awards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Early Life==
Johnson was born in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada, as the sixth of what would become ten children in her family. One of her sisters is a stage actress, and her brother Brendan is a musician with whom she often collaborates.

From the age of two, Alexz would frequently sing for her large extended family; and by the age of seven, she was receiving vocal training, participating in festivals with her local youth choir, and giving solo performances at school and community functions. She entered many talent contests and festivals, and won a National Anthem Contest at the age of 11, with her rendition of the National Anthem being heard on national television. This resulted in numerous radio and television interviews, and interest from management. That year, she was also voted Best Anthem singer of the season by the Vancouver Sun.

Locally, she was often referred to as our "West Coast Celine", and sang the National Anthem at games for the Vancouver Canucks (NHL hockey) and Vancouver Grizzlies (NBA basketball team, now based in Memphis), as well as singing at charity events and fairs around the province, and also the B.C. Summer Games. She opened the Variety Club show singing a duet with Bob McGrath, sang the first set of songs at the Molson Indy (a major car race), and entertained on New Year's Eve at Planet Hollywood at the age of 12.<ref>Biographical information drawn from official biography posted on the web site of the Orange Record Label but not presently available there. However, a copy of that biography can be found [http://www.freewebs.com/luvwithmyguitar/biography.htm here].</ref>

==Acting Career==
===''So Weird''===

With an outgoing personality, Alexz moved into acting, where she excelled, landing auditions for commercials and a showcase for a pilot called "Most Talented Kids". She auditioned for the Disney television series ''So Weird'' which, for the final season of the show, was looking for a lead actress who could also sing. Alexz was offered the job immediately after her audition. This role was a tough assignment, because many fans of the show had already become accustomed to a different story-line, were not happy that the show had shifted from a "darker" to a "lighter" tone, and were upset that the previous lead actress Cara DeLizia was moving on as the show approached its final season. While many long-time fans of the show continued to feel this way, the show nevertheless retained its popularity, and Alexz built up a fan base on the strength of both her acting and her singing. 

Unfortunately, the songs she sang on the show are not generally available in complete, high audio quality versions, despite numerous requests from viewers.  However, versions of varying length and audio quality can be found on the Internet. Rips from a stream that was on the Zoog Disney site for So Weird include “What You Do”, “One In A Million”, and “Never Give Up”. There are also audio rips from the actual episodes of So Weird that include Johnson in the role of Annie: “Cause’ You’re Watching Over Me”; “Push Me, Pull You”; and a duet of “One In A Million World” with Mackenzie Phillips.

===''Instant Star''===

In 2004, Alexz sent in an audition tape to the producers of ''Degrassi: The Next Generation'' for their upcoming show ''Instant Star''. They were specifically looking for a Canadian teen actress/vocalist to play the lead role, Jude Harrison. The first audition tape Executive Producer Stephen Stohn received was Alexz's, and he was convinced she was exactly the one who would be perfect for the role.  The auditioning continued, returning to Alexz in the end.

After its first season, ''Instant Star'' was nominated for three Canadian equivalent of the American Graeme Campbell). The show won the award for Best Direction.<ref>[http://academy.ca/hist/history.cfm?shownum=20&winonly=0&awards=2&rtype=3&curstep=4&submit.x=30&submit.y=8 ACCT - Canadian Awards History Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On August 28, 2007, the show received three more Gemini Award nominations, in the category of Best Children's or Youth Program or Series - two for best direction (Pat Williams and Graeme Campbell), and one for Best Performance (Alexz Johnson, in the episode, "I Fought the Law").<ref>[http://www.geminiawards.ca/gemini22/releases/GM22AllNomination.pdf Microsoft Word - GM22AllNomination.doc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.geminiawards.ca/gemini22/main.cfm 22nd Annual Gemini Awards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, the show did not win further Gemini awards in 2007, with Alexz losing out to Shenae Grimes, who plays the role of Darcy Edwards on Degrassi: The Next Generation.

Alexz Johnson sings all of the songs that her character Jude sings on the show. She has recorded three soundtracks for ''Instant Star'', with three released so far: ''Songs from Instant Star'', ''Songs from Instant Star Two'', ''Songs from Instant Star Three'' . She co-wrote five of the songs on the first album, including ''24 Hours'', ''Let Me Fall'', ''Criminal'', ''Skin'', and ''That Girl''.  She did not write songs on the albums for the second and third seasons, focusing her songwriting instead on her solo CD.

Because of her early start in the music business, Alexz has been giving concerts for over a decade. She is at her best in front of an audience, as shown by her performance of four of the songs from seasons one and two of ''Instant Star'' at a preview event - ''Backstage Pass'' - on The N, just before the broadcast of the second season of the show. From the first season CD, she sang ''Skin'' and ''Let Me Fall'' (both of which she co-wrote); and from the second season, she sang ''Another Thin Line'' and  ''My Sweet Time''. While they definitely like what they are hearing on the CDs, many fans would argue that the live versions of these songs are far better - more emotion and more power.

In the live performances, Alexz is accompanied by her band from the show, ''Spiederman Mind Explosion'', which consists of three members who do double duty as actors and real-life musicians.  They are: Tyler Kyte ("Vincent Spiederman" - "Spied") on lead guitar; Christopher Gaudet ("Wally") on bass; and Ian Blackwood ("Kyle"), on drums.

Alexz Johnson says that she looks forward to the time when she can hopefully "step away from the acting and focus more on becoming a musician".<ref>http://www.viva.tv/TV/ArticleDetail/id/104130/showid/5459/list/1/navactive/3 Audio + Interview - Instant Star on Viva</ref> For her, acting is "a great job" that she works hard at six months of the year and that gives her the financial freedom she needs in order to be able to create her own music for the rest of the year. As reported in the Toronto Star, the show also provides her with much of what she wears. She is a “non-shopper” who wants to stay focused on the music.<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/1119434881.html?dids=1119434881:1119434881&FMT=ABS]</ref>

In a sense, the choice of Alexz to play the lead in ''Instant Star'' was ironic, because her own career has been much more gradual: she has been working her way up in the business over a number of years. However, ''Instant Star'' has given a major boost to both her acting and musical career: people who like the music are tuning in to the show, and people who like the show are buying the music.

===Other Roles===

Johnson also decided to audition for the role of Julie Christenson in the thriller ''Final Destination 3 ''. As it turned out, she showed up at the audition in an all black, punk rockish outfit, later claiming that she had also been in a bad mood. The casting directors concluded that she would be perfect for the role of Erin Ulmer, a character with a bad attitude. This was not a large part, but she played it convincingly, right to the gruesome end. Her performance attracted praise from some critics, even from one (writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer) who said: "The characters are so loathsome, you're glad to see them go. Except for two: the goth couple Ian (Kris Lemche) and Erin (Alexz Johnson). He's a cynical know-it-all, like Dennis Miller with black fingernails; she's like Parker Posey with raccoon mascara.."<ref>[http://ae.miami.com/entertainment/ui/miami/movie.html?id=534419&reviewId=20101 Movie: ''Final Destination 3''<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Alexz has also stated that her roles on both ''Instant Star'' and ''Final Destination 3'' were great acting experiences, and she is very interested in continuing her acting career down the road, but did not want to make a main career out of it, saying she was interested in trying her hand in actual TV production later down the road though.

Johnson was also one of the final choices to play the lead roles in the horror remake of Black Christmas and in the Britney Spears novel inspired movie Brave New Girl. On one of Britney Spears’ many E! True Hollywood Stories, during a clip of Spears celebrating her birthday during the auditioning for Brave New Girl, one can see Johnson, Lindsey Haun, Lynne Spears, the other girl who was up for the lead role, and others singing happy birthday to Britney. Both auditions were confirmed by Alexz's rep.

In September, 2007, Alexz appeared in the lead role in ''Devil's Diary'', a made-for-television movie, shown as the movie of the week on Leo Award, in the category of Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Feature-Length Drama. [http://www.leoawards.com/nominees_2008.html] The Leo Awards are held annually to promote and celebrate excellence in British Columbia's film industry, which is the third largest in North America (after Los Angeles and New York).
