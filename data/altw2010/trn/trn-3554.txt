}}
The '''Kingdom of Italy''' (Italian: '''''Regno d'Italia''''') was a state forged in 1861 by the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia; it existed until 1946 when the Italians opted for a republican constitution. The Kingdom was the first Italian state to include the entire Italian Peninsula since the fall of the Roman Empire.

During the time of the regime of the Italian: ''Impero Italiano'') or the "New Roman Empire" (Italian: ''Nuovo Impero Romano'', Latin: ''Novum Imperium Romanum''), but these were not used officially. The name often given by historians to the Kingdom of Italy during the rule of Mussolini and the Fascists is '''Fascist Italy'''. Under fascism, the Kingdom allied with Nazi Germany in World War II until 1943. In the remaining two years of World War II, the Kingdom of Italy switched sides to the Allies after ousting Mussolini as Prime Minister and banned the Fascist party. The remnant fascist state that continued fighting against the Allies was a puppet state of Nazi Germany, the "Italian Social Republic", still led by Mussolini and his loyalist Fascists in northern Italy. Shortly after the war, civil discontent led to a referendum in 1946 on whether Italy would remain a monarchy or become a republic. Italians decided to abandon the monarchy and form the Italian Republic, which is the present form of Italy today.

== Territory ==
The Kingdom of Italy claimed all of the territory which is modern-day Italy. The development of the Kingdom's territory progressed under Versailles and St Germain, the state was given Gorica, Trieste and Istria (now part of Croatia and Slovenia), and small parts of modern-day northwestern Croatia as well as a minuscule portion of the Croatian province of Dalmatia. During the second World War, the Kingdom gained more territory in Slovenia and more territory from Dalmatia. After the Second World War, the borders of present-day Italy were founded and the Kingdom abandoned its land claims.

The Kingdom of Italy also held colonies and protectorates and puppet states, such as modern-day Italian concession in Tianjin).

==Government==
The Kingdom of Italy was theoretically a constitutional monarchy.  Executive power belonged to the monarch, as executed through appointed ministers.  Two chambers of parliament restricted the monarch's power — an appointive Senate and an elective Chamber of Deputies. The kingdom's constitution was the Statuto Albertino, the former governing document of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In theory, ministers were solely responsible to the king. However, in practice, it was impossible for an Italian government to stay in office without the support of Parliament.

Members of the Chamber of Deputies were elected by majority (winner-take-all) elections in large, regional, multi-seat electoral districts. A candidate needed the support of 50% of those voting, and of 25% of all enrolled voters, to be elected on the first round of balloting. If not all seats were filled on the first ballot, a runoff was hold shortly afterwards for the remaining vacancies.

Between 1925 and 1943, Italy was in fact a fascist dictatorship, though the constitution formally remained in effect.

== Monarchs ==
The monarchs of the House of Savoy who led Italy were
* '''Victor Emmanuel II''' (1861–78) — Former King of Sardinia and first king of united Italy.
* '''Umberto I''' (1878–1900) — Approved the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. Assassinated in 1900 by an anarchist.
* '''Victor Emmanuel III''' (1900–46) — King of Italy during the First World War and during the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini.
* '''Umberto II''' (1946) — The last King of Italy who was pressured to call a referendum on whether Italy would retain the monarchy, in which Italians voted for a republic.

==1859–1870==

The creation of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of concerted efforts of Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire Italian Peninsula. The last state to encompass the Italian peninsula was the Roman Empire and was the beginning of the modern Italian state.
 
After the Austria in the Lombardy-Venetia from Austrian rule. The kingdom also had established important alliances which helped it improve the possibility of Italian unification, such as Britain and France in the Crimean War. Sardinia was dependent on France being willing to protect it and in 1860, Sardinia was forced to cede territory to France to maintain relations.

thumbnail|150px|right|King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, the first King of a united Italy.]]
Following the unification of most of Italy, tensions between the monarchists and republicans erupted. In April 1861, Garibaldi entered the Italian parliament and challenged Cavour's leadership of the government, accusing him of dividing Italy and spoke of the threat of civil war between the Kingdom in the north and Garibaldi's forces in the south. On June 6, 1861, the Kingdom's strongman Cavour died. During the ensuing political instability, Garibaldi and the republicans became increasingly revolutionary in tone. Garibaldi’s arrest in 1862 set off world-wide controversy.<ref>(Smith (1997), p61)</ref>

thumbnail|150px|left|Giuseppe Garibaldi, leader of the republican unification movement in southern Italy.

In 1866 Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck offered Victor Emmanuel II an alliance with the Kingdom of Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War. In exchange Prussia would allow Italy to annex Austrian-controlled Venice. King Emmanuel agreed to the alliance and the Third Italian War of Independence began. Italy fared poorly in the war with a badly organized military against Austria, but Prussia's victory allowed Italy to annex Venice. The one major obstacle to Italian unity remained Rome.

In 1870, Prussia went to war with France starting the Franco-Prussian War. To keep the large Prussian army at bay, France abandoned its positions in Rome in order to fight the Prussians. Italy benefited from Prussia's victory against France by being able to take over the Papal States from French authority. Italian unification was completed, and shortly afterward Italy's capital was moved to Rome. Economic conditions in the united Italy were poor:<ref>(Smith (1997), pp95–96)</ref>, there were no industry or transportation facilities, extreme poverty (especially in the Mezzogiorno), high illiteracy, and only a small percent of wealthy Italians had the right to vote. The unification movement had largely been dependent on the support of foreign powers and remained so afterwards.

Following the capture of Rome in 1870 from French forces of Napoleon III, relations between Italy and the Vatican remained sour for the next sixty years with the prisoners in the Vatican. The Catholic Church frequently protested the actions of the Italian government, refused to meet with envoys from the King and urged Catholics to not vote in Italian elections.<ref>(Smith (1997), p91)</ref> It would not be until 1929, that positive relations would be restored between Italy and the Vatican.

== Liberal period ==
thumb|200px|[[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan. An architectural masterpiece created in the 1880s and named after the first King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel II.]]
After unification, Italy's politics favoured liberalism: the right was regionally fragmented, and conservative Prime Minister Marco Minghetti only held on to power by enacting revolutionary and left-leaning policies (such as the nationalization of railways) to appease the opposition. In 1876, Minghetti was ousted and replaced by liberal Agostino Depretis, who began the long Liberal Period. The Liberal Period was marked by corruption, government instability, continued poverty in southern Italy, and use of authoritarian measures by the Italian government.

Depretis began his term as Prime Minister by initiating an experimental political idea called ''Trasformismo'' (transformism). The theory of ''trasformismo'' was that a cabinet should select a variety of moderates and capable politicians from a non-partisan perspective. In practice, ''trasformismo'' was authoritarian and corrupt, Depretis pressured districts to vote for his candidates if they wished to gain favourable concessions from Depretis when in power. The results of the 1876 election resulted in only four representatives from the right being elected, allowing the government to be dominated by Depretis. Despotic and corrupt actions  are believed to be the key means in which Depretis managed to keep support in southern Italy. Depretis put through authoritarian measures, such as banning public meetings, placing "dangerous" individuals in internal exile on remote penal islands across Italy and adopting militarist policies. Depretis enacted controversial legislation for the time, such as abolishing arrest for debt, making elementary education free and compulsory while ending compulsory religious teaching in elementary schools.<ref>(Smith (1997), pp95–107)</ref>

thumb|325px|left|The [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance in 1913, shown in red.]]
In 1887, Triple Alliance which included both Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1882 and which remained officially intact until 1915. While helping Italy develop strategically, he continued ''trasformismo'' and was authoritarian, once suggesting the use of martial law to ban opposition parties.<ref>(Smith (1997), p133)</ref> Despite being authoritarian, Crispi put through liberal policies such as the Public Health Act of 1888 and establishing tribunals for redress against abuses by the government.<ref>(Smith (1997), p128)</ref>

The overwhelming attention paid to foreign policy alienated the agricultural community in Italy which had been in decline since 1873.<ref>(Smith (1997), p138)</ref> Both radical and conservative forces in the Italian parliament demanded that the government investigate how to improve agriculture in Italy.<ref>(Smith (1997), p136)</ref> The investigation which started in 1877 and was released eight years later, showed that agriculture was not improving, that landowners were earning revenue from their lands and contributing almost nothing to the development of the land. Lower class Italians were hurt by the break-up of communal lands to the benefit of landlords.<ref>(Smith (1997), p136)</ref> Most of the workers on the agricultural lands were not peasants but short-term labourers who at best were employed for one year.<ref>(Smith (1997), p136)</ref> Peasants without stable income were forced to live off meager food supplies, disease was spreading rapidly, plagues were reported, including a major cholera epidemic which killed at least 55,000 people.<ref>(Smith (1997), p137)</ref>

The Italian government could not deal with the situation effectively because of overspending by the Depretis government that left Italy heavily in debt. Italy also suffered economically as a consequence of overproduction of grapes by their vineyards. In the 1870s and 1880s, France's vineyard industry was suffering from vine disease caused by insects. Italy time prospered as the largest exporter of wine in Europe. But following the recovery of France in 1888, southern Italy was overproducing and had to cut back, which caused greater unemployment and bankruptcies.<ref>(Smith (1997), p139)</ref>

=== Early colonialism ===
A number of colonial projects were undertaken by the government. These were done to gain support of Italian nationalists and imperialists, who wanted to rebuild a Roman Empire. Already, Italy had large settlements in Alexandria, Cairo, and Tunis. Italy first attempted to gain colonies through negotiations with other world powers to make colonial concessions. These negotiations failed. Italy also sent missionaries to uncolonized lands to investigate the potential for Italian colonization. The most promising and realistic of these were parts of Africa. Italian missionaries had already established a foothold at Massawa (in present day Eritrea) in the 1830s and had entered deep into Ethiopia.<ref>(Smith (1997), pp115–117)</ref>

On 5 February 1885, shortly after the fall of Egyptian rule in Khartoum, Italy took advantage of Egypt's conflict with Britain by landing soldiers at Massawa. In 1888, Italy annexed Massawa by force, creating the colony of Italian Eritrea.

In 1895, Ethiopia led by Emperor Menelik II abandoned an agreement signed in 1889 to follow Italian foreign policy and Italy used the renunciation as a reason to invade Ethiopia.<ref>(Barclay (1997), p34)</ref> Ethiopia gained the help of Russia, whose own interests in East Africa led Russia's government to sent large amounts of modern weaponry to the Ethiopians to hold back an Italian invasion. In response, Britain decided to back the Italians to challenge Russian influence in Africa and declared that all of Ethiopia was within the sphere of Italian interest. On the verge of war, Italian militarism and nationalism reached a peak, with Italians flocking to the Italian army, hoping to take part in the upcoming war.<ref>(Barclay (1973), p33–34)</ref>

The Italian army failed on the battlefield, overwhelmed by the huge Ethiopian army which forced Italy to retreat into Eritrea.<ref>(Barclay (1973), p35)</ref> The failed Ethiopian campaign was an international embarrassment to Italy. Ethiopia remained independent from Italy and other colonial powers until it was occupied in 1936 by Italy. It was subsequently liberated four years later in World War II.

In 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire and invaded Libya. The war ended only a year later, but the occupation resulted in acts of discrimination against Libyans such as the forced deportation of Libyans to the Tremiti Islands in October 1911. By 1912, a third of these Libyan refugees had died from a lack of food and shelter.<ref>(Bosworth, RJB (2005) ''Mussolini's Italy'', New Work: Allen Lane, ISBN 0713996978, p50)</ref> The annexation of Libya led nationalists to advocate Italy's domination of the Mediterranean Sea by occupying Greece and the Adriatic coastal region of Dalmatia.<ref>(Bosworth (2005), p49)</ref>

=== Giovanni Giolitti ===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: thumbnail|300px|left|[[Giovanni Giolitti, one of Italy's longest serving Prime Ministers.]] -->
In 1892, Giovanni Giolitti became Prime Minister of Italy for his first term. Although his first government quickly collapsed a year later, Giolitti returned in 1903 to lead Italy's government during a fragmented period that lasted until 1914. Giolitti had spent his earlier life as a civil servant, and then took positions within the cabinets of Crispi. Giolitti was the first long-term Italian Prime Minister in many years because he mastered the political concept of ''trasformismo'' by manipulating, coercing and bribing officials to his side. In elections during Giolitti's government, voting fraud was common, and Giolitti helped improve voting only in well-off, more supportive areas, while attempting to isolate and intimidate poor areas where opposition was strong.<ref>(Smith, Dennis Mack (1997) ''Modern Italy; A Political History'', Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, ISBN 0472108956, p199)</ref> Southern Italy was in terrible shape prior to and during Giolitti's tenure as Prime Minister. Four-fifths of southern Italians were illiterate and the dire situation there ranged from problems of large numbers of absentee landlords to rebellion and even starvation.<ref>(Smith (1997), p209–210)</ref> Corruption was such a large problem that Giolitti himself admitted that there were places "where the law does not operate at all".<ref>(Smith (1997), p199)</ref>

In 1911, Giolitti's government sent forces to occupy Libya. While the success of the Libyan War improved the status of the nationalists, it did not help Giolitti's administration as a whole. The government attempted to discourage criticism by speaking about Italy's strategic achievements and inventiveness of their military in the war: Italy was the first country to use the airship for military purposes, and undertook aerial bombing on the Ottoman forces.<ref>(Bosworth, Richard. (1983). ''Italy and the Approach of the First World War''. London: The Macmillan Press Ltd, p42)</ref>  The war radicalized the Italian Socialist Party: anti-war revolutionaries led by future-Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini called for violence to bring down the government. Giolitti returned as Prime Minister only briefly in 1920, but the era of liberalism was effectively over in Italy.

==World War I and aftermath==
===Prelude to war, internal dilemma===
In the lead-up to the First World War, the Kingdom of Italy faced a number of short-term and long-term problems in determining its allies and objectives. Italy's recent success in occupying Libya had sparked tension and jealousy with its allies, Germany and Austria-Hungary. In Munich, Germans reacted to Italy's aggression by singing anti-Italian songs.<ref>(Bosworth (1983), pp99–100)</ref> Italy's relations with France also were in bad shape: France felt betrayed by Italy’s support of Prussia, opening the possibility of war erupting between the two countries.<ref>(Bosworth (1983), p101)</ref> Italy's relations with Britain had also been impaired by constant Italian demands for more recognition in the international stage following the occupation of Libya, and its demands that other nations accept its spheres of influence in East Africa and the Mediterranean.<ref>(Bosworth (1983), p112)</ref> thumb|350px|right|Italy and its colonial possessions at the time of the outbreak of [[World War I. The area between British Egypt and the firmly held Italian territories is the region of southern Cyrenaica which was under dispute of ownership between Italy and the United Kingdom.]]In the Mediterranean, Italy’s relations with Greece were aggravated when Italy occupied the Greek-populated Dodecanese Islands and Rhodes from 1912 to 1914. These islands had been formerly controlled by the Ottoman Empire. Italy and Greece were also in open rivalry over the desire to occupy Albania.<ref>(Bosworth (1983), pp112–114)</ref>
King Emmanuel III himself was uneasy about Italy pursuing distant colonial adventures, and said that Italy should prepare to take back Italian-populated land from Austria-Hungary, as the "completion of the Risorgimento".<ref>(Bosworth (1983), p119)</ref> This idea put Italy at odds with Austria-Hungary.

A major hindrance to Italy's decision on what to do about the war was the political instability throughout Italy in 1914. After the formation of the government of Prime Minister Serbia by Austria-Hungary in 1914, World War I broke out. Despite Italy's official alliance to the German Empire and in the Triple Alliance, she initially remained neutral, claiming that the Triple Alliance was only for defensive purposes.

thumb|left|150px|[[Gabriele d'Annunzio, a prominent nationalist revolutionary who was a supporter of Italy joining action in the First World War.]]
In Italy, society was divided over the war: Italian socialists generally opposed the war and supported pacificism, while nationalists militantly supported the war. Long-time nationalists Gabriele D'Annunzio and Luigi Federzoni and a new convert to nationalism, future Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, demanded that Italy join the war. For the nationalists, the war presented Italy a long-awaited opportunity to use an alliance with the Entente to gain back Italian-populated territories from Austria-Hungary, which had long been part of Italian nationalist aims since unification. In 1915, relatives of Italian nationalist and republican hero Giuseppe Garibaldi died on the battlefield of France, where they had volunteered to fight. Federzoni used the memorial services to declare the importance of Italy joining the war, and to warn the monarchy of the consequences of continued disunity in Italy if it did not:
<blockquote>
"Italy has awaited this since 1866 her truly national war, in order to feel unified at last, renewed by the unanimous action and identical sacrifice of all her sons. Today, while Italy still wavers before the necessity imposed by history, the name of Garibaldi, resanctified by blood, rises again to warn her that she will not be able to defeat the revolution save by fighting and winning her national war."<ref>(Thayer, John A. (1964). ''Italy and the Great War.'' Madison and Milwaukee: University of Wisconsin Press. p279)</ref>
</blockquote>
Mussolini used his new newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia'' and his strong oratorical skills to urge nationalists and patriotic revolutionary leftists to support Italy's entry into the war to gain back Italian populated territories from Austria-Hungary, by saying "enough of Libya, and on to Trent and Trieste".<ref>(Thayer, John A. (1964). ''Italy and the Great War.'' Madison and Milwaukee: University of Wisconsin Press. p279)</ref> Mussolini claimed that it was in the interests of socialists to join the war to tear down the Hohenzollern dynasty of Germany which he claimed was the enemy of all European workers.<ref>(Thayer, p272)</ref> Mussolini and other nationalists warned the Italian government that that Italy must join the war or face revolution and called for violence against pacifists and neutralists.<ref>(Thayer, p253)</ref> Left-wing nationalism also erupted in southern Italy, socialist and nationalist Giuseppe De Felice-Giuffrida saw the Italy joining the war as essential to relieving southern Italy of the rising cost of bread which had caused riots in the south, and advocated a "war of revolution".<ref>(Thayer, p254)</ref>

With nationalist sentiment firmly on the side of reclaiming Italian territories of Austria-Hungary, Italy entered negotiations with the Triple Entente. The negotiations ended successfully in April 1915 when the London Pact was brokered with the Italian government. The pact ensured Italy the right to attain Italian-populated lands it wanted from Austria-Hungary, and land in the Balkans and German colonies in Africa. The proposal fulfilled the desires of Italian nationalists and Italian imperialism, and was agreed to. Italy joined the Triple Entente in its war against Austria-Hungary and Germany.

The reaction in Italy was divided: former Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti was furious over Italy's decision to go to war against Austria-Hungary and Germany. He claimed that Italy would fail in the war, predicting high numbers of mutinies, Austro-Hungarian occupation of more Italian territory, and that the failure would produce a catastrophic rebellion that would destroy the monarchy and the liberal institutions of the state. <ref>(Clark, Martin. 1984. ''Modern Italy: 1871-1982.'' London and New York: Longman Group UK Limited. p.184)</ref>

===Italy's war effort===
thumb|right|200px|[[Luigi Cadorna, (the man to the left of two officers to whom he is speaking) while visiting British batteries during World War I.]]
The outset of the campaign against Austria-Hungary looked initially to favour Italy: Austria-Hungary's army was spread to cover its fronts with Serbia and Russia, and Italy had a numerical superiority against the Austro-Hungarian army. However, this advantage was never fully utilized because Italian military commander Luigi Cadorna insisted on a dangerous frontal assault against Austria-Hungary in an attempt to occupy the Slovenian plateau and Ljubljana. This assault would put the Italian army not far away from Austria-Hungary's imperial capital, Vienna. After eleven failed offensives with enormous loss of life, the Italian campaign to take Vienna collapsed.

Upon entering the war, geography was also a difficulty for Italy, as its border with Austria-Hungary was along mountainous terrain. In May 1915, Italian forces at 400,000 men along the border outnumbered the Austrian and Germans almost precisely four to one.<ref>Seton-Watson, Christopher. 1967. ''Italy from Liberalism to Fascism: 1870 to 1925.'' London: Methuen & Co. Ltd. Pp. 451</ref> However the Austrian defenses were strong even though they were undermanned and managed to hold off the Italian offensive.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 451</ref> The battles with the Austro-Hungarian army along the Alpine foothills in the trench warfare there were drawn-out, long engagements with little progress.<ref>(Clark, Martin. 1984. ''Modern Italy: 1871-1982.'' London and New York: Longman Group UK Limited. p.185)</ref> Italian officers were poorly trained in contrast to the Austro-Hungarian and German armies, and Italian artillery was inferior to the Austrian machine guns and the Italian forces had dangerously low supply of ammunition, this shortage would continually hamper attempts to make advances into Austrian territory.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 451</ref> This combined with the constant replacement of officers by Cadorna resulted in few officers gaining the experience necessary to lead military missions.<ref>(Clark, 1984. p.186)</ref>  In the first year of the war, poor conditions on the battlefield led to outbreaks of cholera causing a significant number of Italian soldiers to die.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 452</ref> Despite these serious problems, Cadorna refused to back down the offensive. Naval battles occurred between the Italian Royal Navy (''Regia Marina'') and the Austro-Hungarian navy. Italy's warships were outclassed by the Austro-Hungarian fleet and the situation was made more dire for Italy in that both France and the United Kingdom refused to send their navies into the Adriatic Sea which they saw has far too dangerous to operate due the concentration of the Austro-Hungarian fleet there.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 452</ref> Morale fell among Italian soldiers who lived a tedious life when not on the front lines: they were forbidden to enter theatres or bars even when on leave. However when battles were about to occur, alcohol was made freely available to the soldiers in order to reduce tension before the battle.In order to escape the tedium after battles, some groups of soldiers worked to create improvised brothels.<ref>(Clark, 1984. p.187)</ref> In order to maintain morale, the Italian army had propaganda lectures of the importance of the war to Italy, especially in order to retrieve Trent and Trieste from Austria-Hungary.<ref>(Clark, 1984. p.187)</ref> Some of these lectures were carried out by popular nationalist war proponents such as Gabriele D'Annunzio. D'Annunzio himself would participate in a number of paramilitary raids on Austrian positions along the Adriatic coastline during the war and lost an eye one of the battles.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 502</ref> Prominent pro-war advocate Benito Mussolini was prevented from giving lecture by the government, most likely because of his revolutionary socialist past.<ref>(Clark, 1984. p.187)</ref>

The Italian government became increasingly aggravated in 1915 with the passive nature of the Pan-Slavists in Serbia.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 453</ref> As Serbia fell to the Austro-Hungarian and German forces in 1915, Cadorna proposed sending 60,000 men to land in Salonika to help the Serbs now in exile in Greece and Albania to fight off the opposing forces, but the Italian government's bitterness to Serbia resulted in the proposal being rejected.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 453</ref>

After 1916, the situation for Italy grew steadily worse, the Austro-Hungarian army managed to push the Italian Army back into Italy as far as Verona and Padua in their Strafexpedition. At the same time Italy faced a shortage of warships, increased attacks by submarines, soaring freight charges threatening the ability to supply food to soldiers, lack of raw materials and equipment, and Italians faced high taxes to pay for the war.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 456</ref> Austro-Hungarian and German forces had gone deep into northern Italian territory, and finally in November 1916, Cadorna ended offensive operations and began a defensive approach. In 1917, France, the United Kingdom and the United States offered to send troops to Italy to help it fend off the offensive of the Central Powers, but the Italian government refused, as Sonnino did not want Italy to be seen as a client state of the Allies and preferred isolation as the more brave alternative.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 461-2</ref> Italy also wanted to keep Greece out of the war, as the Italian government feared that should Greece join the war on the side of the Allies, it would intend to annex Albania, which Italy wanted as its own.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 463</ref> Fortunately for Italy, pro-war advocates in Greece failed to succeed in pressuring the Greek King to bring the country into the conflict, and Italian aims on Albania remained unthreatened.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 463</ref>

With the collapse of the Avanti!'' of the Italian Socialist Party declared "Let the bourgeoisie fight its own war".<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 469</ref> Leftist women in northern Italian cities led protests demanding action against the high cost of living and demanding an end to the war.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 470</ref> In Milan in May 1917, Bolshevik revolutionaries organized and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 471</ref>  The Italian army was forced to enter Milan with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and anarchists who fought violently until May 23 when the army gained control of the city with almost fifty people killed (three of which were Italian soldiers) and over 800 people arrested.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 471</ref>

After the Battle of Caporetto in 1917, Italian forces were forced far back into Italian territory, and the humiliation led to the arrival of Vittorio Orlando as Prime Minister who managed to solve some of Italy's wartime problems. Orlando abandoned the previous isolationist approach to the war and increased coordination with the Allies and the use of the convoy system to fend off submarine attack, allowed Italy to be able to end food shortages from February 1918 onward, and Italy received more raw materials from the Allies.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 486</ref> Also in 1918, began the official repression of enemy aliens and Italian socialists were increasingly repressed by the Italian government. The Italian government was infuriated with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points as the advocation of national self-determination meant that Italy would not gain Dalmatia as had been promised in the Treaty of London.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 493</ref> In parliament, nationalists condemned Wilson's fourteen points as betraying the Treaty of London, while socialists claimed that Wilson's points were valid and claimed the Treaty of London was an offense to the rights of Slavs, Greeks, and Albanians.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 493</ref> Negotiations between Italy and the Allies, particularly the new Yugoslav delegation (replacing the Serbian delegation), agreed to a trade off between Italy and a new Yugoslav state, which was that Dalmatia as claimed by Italy would be accepted as Yugoslav, while Istria as claimed by the Yugoslavs would be accepted as Italian.<ref>Seton-Watson, Pp. 495</ref>

At Piave the Italian army managed to hold off the Austro-Hungarian and German armies. The opposing armies repeatedly failed afterwards in major battles such as Battle of Asiago and the Battle of Vittorio Veneto. The Italian Army crushed the Austrian offensive in the latter battle. Austria-Hungary ended the fighting against Italy with the armistice on 11 November 1918 which ended World War I.

During the war, the Italian Royal Army increased in size from 15,000 men in 1914 to 160,000 men in 1918, with 5 million recruits in total entering service during the war.<ref>(Clark, 1984. p.186)</ref> This came at a terrible cost: by the end of the war, Italy had lost 700,000 soldiers and had a budget deficit of twelve billion lira. Italian society was divided between the majority pacifists who opposed Italian involvement in the war and the minority of pro-war nationalists who had condemned the Italian government for not having immediately gone to war with Austria in 1914.

===Italy's territorial settlements and the reaction===

As the war came to an end, British Prime Minister French President United States President Woodrow Wilson in Versailles, to discuss how the borders of Europe should be redefined to help avoid a future European war.

The talks provided little territorial gain to Italy because Wilson, during the peace talks, promised freedom to all European nationalities to form their own nation states. As a result, the Treaty of Versailles did not assign Dalmatia and Albania to Italy, as had been promised in the London Pact. Furthermore, the British and French decided to divide the German overseas colonies into mandates of their own, with Italy receiving none of them. Despite this, Orlando signed the Treaty of Versailles, which caused uproar against his government. Civil unrest erupted in Italy between nationalists who supported the war effort and opposed the "mutilated victory" (as nationalists called it) and leftists who were opposed to the war.

Furious over the peace settlement, Italian nationalist revolutionary Gabriele D'Annunzio led nationalists into the free state of Fiume in September 1919. His popularity among nationalists led him to be called ''Il Duce'' (The Leader) and he used blackshirted paramilitary in his assault on Fiume, the blackshirt paramilitary uniform would later become synonymous with the fascist movement of Mussolini. The demand for annexation of Fiume spread to all sides of the political spectrum, including Mussolini's revolutionary fascists.<ref>Smith (1997), p293</ref> D'Annunzio’s stirring speeches drew Croatian nationalists to his side. He also kept contact with the Irish Republican Army and Egyptian nationalists.<ref>Bosworth (2005), pp112–113.</ref>

The occupation ended one year later, but Fiume later was annexed by Italy in 1924. Mussolini learned from D'Annunzio the ways to arouse patriotism in order to gain support from nationalists, socialists, anarchists, and army veterans.<ref>Smith, Dennis Mack (1997) ''Modern Italy; A Political History'', Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1997, ISBN 0472108956, pp293–294</ref>

=== Rise of the movement ===
In 1914, Avanti!''. Over time, he simply called for revolution, without mentioning class struggle.<ref>Smith (1997), p284</ref> Mussolini's nationalism enabled him to raise funds from Ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies to create his own newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia'' to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.<ref>Smith (1997), p284</ref> France, Britain, and Russia, wanting to draw Italy to the Entente, helped finance the newspaper.<ref>Clark, Martin. ''Modern Italy:1871-1982''. London and New York: Longman Group UK Limited. p.183</ref> This newspaper became Fascist Italy's officially-supported newspaper years later. During the war, Mussolini served in the Italian army and was wounded once during the war. The wound is widely believed to be the result of an accident in grenade practice, although he claimed to have been wounded in battle.<ref>Smith (1997), p284</ref>

Following the end of the war and the Treaty of Versailles, in 1919, Mussolini created the ''pacifist nature of the Italian Socialist Party. The Fascists initially had a platform far more inclined to the left, promising social revolution, proportional representation, women's suffrage, and dividing private property held by estates.<ref>Smith (1997), pp284–286)</ref> On 15 April 1919, the Fascists made their debut in political violence, when a group of members from the ''Fasci di Combattimento'' attacked the offices of ''Avanti!'' Recognizing the failures of the Fascists' initial revolutionary and left-leaning policy, Mussolini moved the organization away from the left and turned the revolutionary movement into an electoral movement in 1921 named the ''Partido Nazionale Fascista'' (National Fascist Party). The party copied the nationalist themes of D'Annunzio and rejected parliamentary democracy while still operating within to destroy it. Mussolini changed his original revolutionary policies, such as moving away from anti-clericalism to supporting the Catholic Church and abandoned his public opposition to the monarchy.<ref>Smith (1997), p298</ref> Fascist support and violence began to grow in 1921 and Fascist-supporting army officers began taking arms and vehicles from the army to use in counterrevolutionary attacks on socialists.<ref>Smith (1997), p302</ref>

In 1920, Giolitti had come back as Prime Minister in an attempt to solve Italy's deadlock. One year later, Giolitti's government had already become unstable, and a growing socialist opposition further endangered his government. Giolitti believed that the Fascists could be toned down and used to protect the state from the socialists. He decided to include Fascists on his electoral list for the 1921 elections.<ref>Smith (1997), p298</ref> In the elections, the Fascists did not make large gains, but Giolitti's government failed to gather a large enough coalition to govern and offered the Fascists placements in his government. The Fascists rejected Giolitti's offers and joined with socialists in bringing down his government.<ref>Bosworth (2005), p112</ref> A number of descendants of those who had served Garibaldi's revolutionaries during unification were won over to Mussolini's nationalist revolutionary ideals.<ref>(Smith (1997), p312</ref> His advocacy of corporatism and futurism had attracted advocates of the "third way".<ref>Smith (1997), p312</ref> But most importantly he had won over politicians in Italy like Facta and Giolitti who did not condemn him for his Blackshirts' mistreatment of socialists.<ref>Smith (1997), p315</ref>

In October 1922, Mussolini took advantage of a general strike by workers in Italy, and announced his demands to the Italian government to give the Fascist Party political power or face a coup. With no immediate response, a small number of Fascists began a long trek across Italy to Rome which was called the Victor Emmanuel III faced a political crisis. The King was forced to choose which of the two rival movements in Italy would form the government: Mussolini's Fascists, or the anti-monarchist Italian Socialist Party. He selected the Fascists.

=== Dictatorship of "''Il Duce''" ===
thumb|300px|right|Mussolini was initially a highly popular leader in Italy until Italy's military failures in World War II. Here Mussolini salutes to crowds of thousands of people.

On October 28, 1922, Victor Emmanuel III selected Mussolini to become Italian Prime Minister, allowing Mussolini and the Fascist Party to pursue their political ambitions as long as they supported the monarchy and its interests. Mussolini was a very young political leader (at the age of 39) compared to other Italian prime ministers and world leaders at the time. Mussolini was called ''Il Duce'', or "The Leader" by his supporters, an unofficial title that was commonly used to describe Mussolini's position during the Fascist era. A personality cult was developed that portrayed him as the nation's saviour which was aided by the personal popularity he held with Italians already which would remain strong until Italy faced continuous military defeats in World War II. 

Upon taking power, Mussolini formed a legislative coalition with nationalists, liberals and populists. However goodwill by the Fascists towards parliamentary democracy faded quickly: Mussolini's coalition passed the electoral Acerbo Law of 1923, which gave two thirds of the seats in parliament to the party or coalition that achieved 25% of the vote. The Fascist Party used violence and intimidation to achieve the 25% threshold in the 1924 election, and became the ruling political party of Italy.

Following the election, Socialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti was assassinated after calling for an annulment of the elections because of the irregularities. Following the assassination, the Socialists walked out of parliament, allowing Mussolini to pass more authoritarian laws. In 1925, Mussolini accepted responsibility for the Fascist violence in 1924, and then declared a Fascist dictatorship in which he would be the unopposed Prime Minister of Italy with the assent of the King.

The result of Mussolini's take over of the government was the creation of a diarchy in Italy, with Mussolini wielding enormous political powers, while the King retained some rights including the ability to remove the Prime Minister which was seen as a minor power but would be pivotal in the fall of Mussolini from power years later.

=== Culture, propaganda, society, and achievements ===

After rising to power, the Fascist regime set Italy on a course to becoming a one-party state and to integrate Fascism into all aspects of life. A totalitarian state as was officially declared in the Doctrine of Fascism of 1935,

Als '''Königreich Italien''' gelten historisch:

* das aus dem Frankenreich 872 hervorgegangene Königreich in Oberitalien, 951 dem Heiligen Römischen Reich angeschlossen, seitdem ''Reichsitalien'' genannt
* das aus der Cisalpinischen Republik Napoléons 1805 hervorgegangene kleinere Königreich in Nordostitalien. Napoléon war 1805–1814 auch König von Italien, übertrug aber die Regierung seinem Adoptivsohn Eugène de Beauharnais als Vizekönig von Italien. Das napoleonische Königreich Italien bestand aus 24 Departements. Ein Teil des heutigen Nordostitalien (15 Departements) gehörte direkt zum Kaiserreich Frankreich.

*Das aus dem Königreich Sardinien 1861 im Zuge des Risorgimento hervorgegangene und bis 1946 ganz Italien umfassende Königreich (abzüglich 1943–1945 der Republik von Salò im Norden), aus dem die Republik Italien hervorgegangen ist.

== Flaggenstreit ==
Um die Flagge des letzten Königreiches bzw. der gegenwärtigen Republik streitet Italien seit 2003. Nach einer Reform Ministerpräsident Berlusconis wurden die Farben per Gesetz neu definiert. Statt des dato kräftigen Grün-Weiß-Rot hat Grün nun eine mehr lindgrüne, Weiß nun eine leicht elfenbeinfarbene und auch Rot eine blassere Nuance. Bis auf das fehlende Emblem ähnelt die Flagge somit wieder jener des Königreiches, was vor allem die linke Opposition kritisiert.
