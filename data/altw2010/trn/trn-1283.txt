== Technical details ==
A traditional 6-speed F430 is not used. However, the Manettino concept first seen in the F430 also appears in this car.  Ferrari sourced the semi-active magneto rheological dampers.<ref>[http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/Applications/PrimarySuspension/tabid/3329/Default.aspx Primary Suspension<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Reviewers of the car have mentioned that the MagneRide suspension gives the 599 a very comfortable ride but allows it to handle well at the same time.

The Fiorano also sees the debut of Ferrari's new traction control system, called F1-Trac. Reportedly tuned using inputs from 7-time Fiorano test track at just 1 second behind Michael's time.

The first publicly recorded crash of a 599 GTB occurred when ''Car and Driver'' writer Aaron Robinson crashed one into the retaining wall of the Passo della Cisa in Italy, a few meters from a monument to Enzo Ferrari (for his finishing fourth in a 1919 hill climb on that same road). The car suffered only minor damage to the front right fender, and Robinson and photographer Mike Valente were able to drive it back to the factory.

Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne has also crashed his 599 GTB in November 2007.

To market the 599 GTB in the Americas, Ferrari embarked on a  trek from Brazil to New York in two cars. The two cars drove through 16 countries and had minimal (mainly suspension) changes made to the mechanicals.

''evo Car of the Year favorite winning in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2003, and 2004. Even with the release of the brilliant 911 Turbo (997), it was denied from the list because the 911 GT3 (997) was considered more impressive. Notably, previous GT3s have won the eCOTY in '99 and '03, making the current car a fierce contender for the title. The Porsche came in second with 94.8 points just behind the 599 with 95.4 points. Lamborghini came in third with the redesigned and more powerful Murciélago LP640 garnering 93.4 points.
