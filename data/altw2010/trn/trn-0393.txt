The '''Metropolitan Police Service''' ('''MPS''') is the New Scotland Yard in Westminster, although administrative functions are increasingly based at the Empress State Building (ESB) and since the end of 2007 all command and control functions have been transferred to the three Metcall complexes. 

With over 31,000 Police Officers, 2,000 Special Constables, 13,661 police staff, 414 traffic wardens and 2,106 Sir Ian Blair, QPM.

==Area covered and other forces==

The MPS area is known as the Metropolitan Police District (MPD) and coincides with the 32 London boroughs that make up Greater London, but excludes the City of London.

Before Northaw and Cuffley and Waltham Abbey.

The square mile of the City of London is the responsibility of the City of London Police, a separate Home Office territorial force.

The rail network, including the London Underground, Tramlink and the Docklands Light Railway.<ref></ref> 

The English part of the Hampstead Heath. Those officers have full police powers within their limited jurisdiction, but all substantial crime and incidents are the responsibility of the MPS.

Some London borough councils maintain their own borough park constabularies, such as the Newham Parks Constabulary in East London; their remit only extends to park by-laws, and although sworn as constables they are not police officers.

==Structure: MPS directorates ==

The MPS is divided into ten departments or directorates, each commanded by an Assistant Commissioner or, in the case of civilianized departments (such as Human Resources), a director of police staff, the equivalent civilian grade. The Management Board is made up of the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner Paul Stephenson and these departmental heads.

===Territorial Policing===
The Territorial Policing directorate is commanded by Assistant Commissioner Tim Godwin. It is responsible for everyday policing across London and is divided into 32 Borough Operational Command Units (BOCUs), contiguous with the London boroughs (with the exception of the Royal Parks OCU). Each BOCU is commanded by a Chief Superintendent, apart from Westminster, which due to its high concentration of government facilities is led by a Commander. 

Each BOCU provides patrol and response police officers, safer neighbourhood teams, Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officers and other local squads and units. The Aviation Security Operational Command Unit (OCU), responsible for policing Heathrow Airport and also London City Airport, is also under Territorial Policing. 

====Number of officers per borough====
Each BOCU has the following 'officer establishment'. The two letter code given in brackets for each borough is the ID code for that borough. Every Constable and Sergeant in the borough will have those letters on their epaulettes as part of their "shoulder number".

===Specialist Crime Directorate (SCD)===
The SCD is commanded by Assistant Commissioner Steve House. It deals with serious, organised and specialist crime investigations and is divided into commands as follows:

* '''Homicide Command (SCD 1)''', made up of a number of major investigation teams (MITs) and is responsible for the investigation of homicide and other serious crimes. Other units, such as Child Abuse Command and Operation Trident (see below) conduct murder investigations if the homicide falls within their remit. MITs investigate murder, manslaughter, infanticide, attempted murder where the evidence of intent is unambiguous or there is a substantive risk to life, missing persons or abductions where there is a substantive reason to suspect life has been taken or is under threat, and other investigations identified for specialist needs. Another unit in this command is the Homicide Task Force, which conducts work to suppress murder and ‘man hunts’ for those suspects wanted for murder. 

* '''Fingerprint Services''', who take fingerprints of people currently living in the UK if they require Police Clearance and Good Conduct certificates from countries such as Australia.<ref>http://www.met.police.uk/scd/specialist_units/fingerprint_services.htm</ref>. They also provide fingerprints for various other reasons [http://www.met.police.uk/scd/specialist_units/fingerprint_services.htm]

*'''Forensic Services (SCD 4)'''

* '''Child Abuse Investigation Team (SCD 5)''', made up of the Paedophile Unit, the Hi-Tech Crime Unit, the Child Abuse Prevention and Partnership Unit, the Ports Safeguarding Team and Major Investigation Teams.

* '''Economic and Specialist Crime Command (SCD 6)''' including the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit, the Money Laundering Investigation Team, Financial Investigation Development Units, the Specialist Crime Operations Team, the Stolen Vehicle Unit, the Arts and Antiques Unit, the Police Central e-crime Unit (PCeU), the Wildlife Crime Unit, the Extradition and International Assistance Unit, the Criminal Justice Protection Unit, and the Regional Asset Recovery Team.

* '''Trident Operational Command Unit (SCD 8)''' was set up in 1998 as a proactive unit combatting gun crime perpetrated on London’s black communities. A new command structure was set up on 24 July 2000, with three specialist senior detectives supported by 160 police officers tasked with black community gun crime cases. Trident is currently broken down into murder, proactive/shootings and intelligence wings, staffed by 270 officers and 70 staff. In January 2004 Trident also took on the investigation of shootings in all of London’s communities, through the Trafalgar team of 34 officers.

* '''The Serious and Organised Crime Group (SCD 7)''' ‘tackles serious and organised crime, life-threatening crimes in action and those who inflict human misery on the people of London through fast time pro-active response’. The group is made up of the Central Task Force, the Projects Team, the Flying Squad, the Kidnap and Special Investigation Unit, the Hostage and Crisis Negotiations Unit and the Intelligence Support Unit.

*'''Covert Policing (SCD 10)'''

*'''Intelligence (SCD 11)'''
