The '''United States presidential election of 2008''', scheduled for Tuesday, quadrennial Vice President of the United States Senator from Arizona, for the Republican Party and Democratic Party. The 2008 election is particularly notable because it is the first time in US history that two sitting senators will run against each other for president<ref>{{cite journal

The Libertarian Party has nominated former Congressman Constitution Party has nominated pastor and radio talk show host Green Party has nominated former Congresswoman independent candidate.

The election will coincide with the 2008 Senate elections in thirty-three states, House of Representatives elections in all states, and gubernatorial elections in eleven states, as well as various state referendums and local elections.

As in the 2004 presidential election, the allocation of electoral votes to each state will be based partially on the 2000 Census. The president-elect and vice president-elect are scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2009.

== Characteristics ==
=== No incumbents===
The 2008 election marks the first time since the 1928 election in which neither an 1952 election that neither the incumbent President nor incumbent Vice President is a candidate in the general election. The incumbent President, George W. Bush, is serving his second term and is barred from running again by the term limits in the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution. Vice President Dick Cheney chose not to seek the presidency.

===Absence of Vice President===
In the three previous two-term Presidential administrations &mdash; those of 1960 election, 1988 election, and 2000 election.)<ref name="historicalresults"> "[http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html Historical Election Results: Electoral College Box Scores 1789-1996]", If nominated, I will not run; if elected, I will not serve."<ref></ref> The 2008 election is the first in which the Vice President is not a candidate for either the presidency or the vice presidency since Nelson Rockefeller in 1976.

=== Leading candidates are senators ===
Following the 1960 that a sitting Senator will be elected President of the United States, and only the third time ever in American history, after John F. Kennedy and Warren G. Harding.

=== Leading candidates' origins and age ===
Either candidate would become the first president born outside the white mother and Luo ethnic group,<ref></ref> would be the first president to be black and to be biracial. McCain would be the first president from 1952 and 1956, and 1964.

Also, if inaugurated on ascension to the presidency at age 72&nbsp;years and 144&nbsp;days,<ref>Bash, Dana. [http://edition.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/08/29/mccain.birthday/index.html "With McCain, 72 is the new... 69?"], CNN (2006-09-04). Retrieved 2008-05-10.</ref> and the second-oldest president to be inaugurated (Ronald Reagan was 73&nbsp;years and 350&nbsp;days old at his second inauguration).<ref>[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%2273+years+and+350+days+old+Monday%22&hl=en&um=1&ie=UTF-8 "Presidential Inaugural Facts"], ''Miami Herald'' (1985-01-20). Excerpt via Google News. Retrieved 2008-03-30.</ref>

Barack Obama and John McCain are 24&nbsp;years and 340&nbsp;days apart in age. This is the largest age disparity between the two major party presidential candidates, surpassing 1996.

== Campaign ==

=== Pre-primary campaign ===
"Front runner" status is dependent on the news agency reporting, but by October 2007, the consensus listed about six candidates as leading the pack. For example, CNN listed Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Rudolph Giuliani, Barack Obama, Fred Thompson, and Mitt Romney as the front runners.
''The Washington Post'' listed Clinton, Edwards and Obama as the Democratic frontrunners, "leading in polls and fundraising and well ahead of the other major candidates".<ref>
</ref> MSNBC's Chuck Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the Republican front runners after the second Republican presidential debate.<ref>"[http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/05/15/192366.aspx Winners & Losers]", Chuck Todd, MSNBC, May 15, 2007.
</ref>

Three candidates, Clinton, Obama, and Romney, raised over $20 million in the first three months of 2007, and three others, Edwards, Giuliani, and McCain, raised over $12 million; the next closest candidate was Bill Richardson, who raised over $6 million.<ref> "[http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008-presidential-candidates/finance/2007/q1/ Campaign Finance: First Quarter 2007 FEC Filings]", ''The Washington Post'' 2007.</ref> In the third quarter of 2007, the top four GOP fund raisers were Romney, Giuliani, Thompson, and Ron Paul.<ref></ref> Paul set the GOP record for the largest online single day fund raising on November 5, 2007.<ref> See also: 
</ref> Hillary Clinton set the Democratic record for largest single day fund raising on June 30, 2007.<ref></ref>

=== Primaries and caucuses ===

Although the nomination process for each of the two major political parties technically continues through June, in previous cycles the candidates have been effectively chosen by the March primaries. This trend continued in 2008 on the Republican side, with John McCain locking up the nomination with victories in WTOP News'', Associated Press, May 15, 2008.  [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080515/ap_on_el_pr/popular_vote_fact_check Alternate link], ''Yahoo! News''.</ref>

During late 2007, both parties adopted rules against states moving their primaries to an earlier date in the year. For the Republicans, the penalty for this violation is supposed to be the loss of half the state party's delegates to the convention. The Democratic Party only allowed four states to hold elections before February 5, 2008. Initially the Democratic Party leadership said it would strip all Democratic delegates from Florida and Michigan, which had moved their primaries all the way into January. All major candidates agreed officially not to campaign in Florida or Michigan, and Edwards and Obama had their names removed from the Michigan ballot. Clinton won a majority of delegates from both states (though 40 percent voted uncommitted) and subsequently led a fight to fully seat the Florida and Michigan delegates.
[http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2008/06/02/080602taco_talk_hertzberg] 

Political columnist Christopher Weber notes that while this was self-serving, it was also pragmatic on the part of Clinton should Florida or Michigan voters have not voted for Democrats in the general election based on the Democratic Party's decision regarding the seating of delegates. [http://news.aol.com/political-machine/2008/05/25/why-hillary-continues-to-run-by-hillary/12] This led to speculation that the fight over the delegates could last until the convention in August. However, on May 31, 2008, a deal was reached by the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic Party that allows for delegates from Michigan and Florida to receive half a vote each. [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91041000]

==== January 2008 ====
Around the start of the year, support for Mike Huckabee and Barack Obama began rising in the polls, passing longtime front runners Romney and Clinton for first place in Iowa: the two upstart campaigns were triumphant. Suddenly John McCain displaced Rudy Giuliani and Romney as the front-runner in New Hampshire.

While Huckabee had little money and was hoping for a third place finish, Obama was the new front runner in New Hampshire and the Clinton campaign was struggling. However, in a turning point for her campaign, Clinton's voice wavered with emotion in a public interview broadcast live on TV.<ref> See also: </ref> By the end of that day, Clinton won the primary by 2 points, contrary to the predictions of pollsters who had her as much as twelve points behind on the day of the primary itself. McCain also staged a turnaround victory, having been written off by the pundits and in single digits less than a month before.<ref> See also: </ref>

With the Republicans stripping Michigan and Florida of half their delegates, the Republican race was based there, while the Democrats focused on Nevada and South Carolina, which were given special permission to have early contests. In South Carolina Obama got 55% of the vote. Meanwhile, McCain managed a small victory in South Carolina, setting him up for a larger and more important victory in Florida soon after.

==== February 2008 ====
On California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rudy Giuliani (who had dropped out of the race following the Florida primary), giving McCain a significant boost in the state.<ref></ref> Schwarzenegger's wife, Maria Shriver, endorsed Obama.<ref></ref>

By February 4, it was apparent that McCain might be able to wrap up the nomination quickly, while the 22 primaries and caucuses on the Democratic side might lead to a virtual tie in the delegate count, which to some extent is what has happened.

'''Super Tuesday''': On U.S. presidential primary elections was held.<ref name="SJFPPbbc">
</ref> Twenty-four states and American Samoa held either caucuses or primary elections for one or both parties on this date, leaving the Democrats in a virtual tie, and John McCain just short of clinching the Republican nod.<ref>
</ref> A few days later, Mitt Romney suspended his presidential campaign and endorsed McCain<ref></ref>, leaving Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul as the only major challengers of McCain in the remaining Republican primaries.

Louisiana and Washington voted for both parties on February 9, while Nebraska and the U.S. Virgin Islands voted for the Democrats and Kansas voted for the Republicans. Obama swept all four Democratic contests, as well as the Maine caucuses the next day,<ref></ref> and Huckabee also came out on top in Kansas, winning by an even greater percentage. The District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia voted for both parties on February 12 in the so-called Potomac primary. Obama won all three for the Democrats (giving him eight consecutive victories after Super Tuesday) and McCain took all three for the Republicans.

Obama carried both Hawaii and Wisconsin, the last two states that voted for the Democrats in February, on the 19th.<ref name="msnbc21660914"></ref> Wisconsin and Washington (primary) voted for the Republicans on February 19; John McCain won these states.<ref name="msnbc21660914"/> The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico closed February for the Republicans, on the 23rd and 24th.

==== March 2008 ====
For the Republicans, on Mini Tuesday,<ref> See also: </ref> when the delegate-rich states of Texas and Ohio, along with Rhode Island and Vermont, voted for both parties. Wyoming then voted for the Democrats and Guam voted for the Republicans on March 8. Mississippi voted on March 11.

In what some considered a surprise upset of Barack Obama on March 4,<ref></ref> Hillary Clinton carried Ohio and Rhode Island in the Democratic primaries.<ref name=SuperTuesdayIIresults></ref>  She also carried the primary in Texas, but Obama won the Texas caucuses held the same day and netted more delegates from the state than Clinton.<ref></ref>  John McCain clinched the Republican nomination after sweeping all four primaries, Texas, Ohio, Vermont and Rhode Island, putting him over the top of the 1,191 delegates required to win the GOP nomination.<ref name=SuperTuesdayIIresults /> Mike Huckabee finally conceded the race to McCain, leaving Ron Paul, who had just 16 delegates, as his only remaining opponent for the Republican nomination.<ref></ref> In the Wyoming Democratic caucuses, Obama edged out Clinton to gain 7 delegates to her 5, and three days later he beat her again, 59%–39%, in Mississippi.

==== April through June 2008 ====
Only one state voted in April: Puerto Rico held a Democratic primary on New Mexico (Republican), Montana (Democratic), and South Dakota (both parties).  Clinton won South Dakota's primary, while Obama was victorious in the Montana primary.  As expected, John McCain won all the states during this time period handily, though typically 20-25% of the vote in the Republican primaries went to Huckabee and Paul, despite the fact both had already been mathematically eliminated from contention for the nomination.

350px|thumb|Raspodjela '''izbornog kolegija''' (Electoral college) po državama na predsjedničkim izborima 2008.
U Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama  4. studenog predsjednik SAD-a.''' Izbori nisu neposredni, na izborima biraju se '''izbornici''' za '''izborni kolegij''' (''Electoral College''). Kandidat, koji osvoji najmanje 270 glasova u izbornom kolegiju postaje predsjednikom SAD-a. Ukoliko nitko od kandidata ne osvojio potrebnu većinu, predsjednika bira američki kongres.

== Izborni sustav ==
Izbori za predsjednika SAD-a odvijaju se '''posredno preko izbornika u svakoj državi zasebno'''. Onaj kandidat koji osvoji najveći broj glasova u pojedinoj državi, dobiva '''sve predviđene izbornike''' (elektore). Jedna država je jedna izborna jedinica, pa stoga vrijedi '''većinski izborni sustav'''.

Raspodjela izbornika svake države ovisi o omjeru stanovnika prema ukupnom stanovništvu SAD-a. 

Iako se natjeću niz kandidata, u političkoj praksi relevantni kandidati su samo iz Demokratske stranke i Republikanske stranke. 

== Kandidati Demokratske stranke ==

=== Službeni kandidati u nominacijskom procesu ===
U nominacijskom procesu za demokratskog predsjedničkog kandidata (''Democratic nomination process'') natječu se još troje kandidata, no trenutno se vodi tjesna utrka između Barack Obame i Hillary Clinton. Obamu podržava 1.846, a Clinton 1.685 izaslanika.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/scorecard/#D '''CNN Politics.com''' - Election Center 2008. ''Results: Democrats''] (8. svibnja 2008.)</ref>Tijekom svibnja  održati će se još 4 predizbora, tada će se najvjerovatnije znati pobjednik. No, američki analitičari ocjenjuju da Obama ima veće izglede za pobjedu nego Clinton.

'''Nacionalna konvencija Demokratske stranke''' (''Democratic National Convention'') održati će se  25. - 28. kolovoza 2008. u gradu Denver u državi Colorado. Na njoj će sudjelovati '''4.049 izaslanika''', od toga su 3.253 izaslanici (''pledged delegates'') iz pojedinih država i 796 dužnosnika sa statusom izaslanika (''Superdelegates'').
Kandidat koji dobije '''2.025 izaslanika''' izabran je službenog predsjedničkog kandidata Demokratske stranke.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/02/delegate.explainer/index.html'''CNN Politics.com''' - Election Center 2008.
