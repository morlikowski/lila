Hizbullah atau Hezbollah bermaksud Penolong Allah. Kumpulan Islam mazhab Syiah ini merupakan sebuah parti politik di Lubnan.  Hizbullah juga mempunyai  pasukan tentera dan kegiatan awam yang berkesan di Lubnan.  Hizbullah wujud berikutan penjajahan tentera Israel terhadap selatan Lubnan pada 1982 dan tahun 2000. Pemimpin utamanya kini ialah Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah.

Hizbullah terbentuk hasil inspirasi kejayaan  Revolusi Iran pada tahun 1979 pimpinan mullah  terkenal Ayatollah Ruhullah Khomeini. Pada tahun 1982 , pilihan terbaik umat Islam di Lubnan bagi mengatasi penjajahan Israel 1982 atau dikenali sebagai Perang Lubnan ialah meniru cara dan gaya kepimpinan ulama dalam Revolusi Islam Iran. Kebetulan pula ramai orang Islam  mazhab Syiah di Lubnan , Syria dan Jordan dan Iraq sendiri. Setiap negara tersebut  mempunyai  kumpulan atau parti yang dinamakan Hizbullah.

Amerika Syarikat selaku sekutu / boneka Israel menuduh sumber kewangan Hizbullah adalah daripada kerajaan Syria dan kerajaan Iran.  Jika Amerika menjadi sekutu Israel dibenarkan, mengapa Syria dan Iran tidak boleh menjadi sekutu Lubnan. Sedikit sebanyak masalah kewangan, keselamatan dan  minyak yang amat diperlukan oleh Lubnan disumbangkan oleh Syria dan Iran.

Syria dan Iran sendiri rela dan terpaksa membantu jirannya dari segi politik , kewangan , persenjataan dan perkaderan. . Jirannya yang kuat pastinya menjadi benteng sebelum Israel dapat sampai ke negara Syria dan Iran.  Majoriti penduduk Iran adalah bermazhab Syiah . Sokongan dan dokongan terhadap pengikut Syiah di negara jiran terdekat mempunyai keuntungan politik kepada survival Revolusi Islam Iran.

Israel telah lama menjadi proksi Amerika Syarikat untuk menguasai kekayaan petroleum di Iran , Iraq, Arab Saudi dan lain-lain. Selagi peperangan berlaku di luar Amerika, Selagi itulah  Amerika akan  selamat. 

Amerika menganggap serangan Israel ke atas Hizbullah ini sebagai sebahagian dari rancangan membendung dan mengatasi keganasan. Sebelum ini sumber 'pengganas' di Afghanistan dan Iraq telah dihapuskan. Sementara sumber 'pengganas' di Indonesia  telah dilumpuhkan oleh alam semulajadi iaitu tsunami 2003, Gunung Merapi 2006  dan tsunami 2006. Sumber 'pengganas' di Mindanau ,Filipina telah dilumpuhkan pada tahun 2002 yang lalu.

Kerajaan Syria dan Iran memang mengaku membantu Hizbullah tapi menafikan bantuan senjata. Melalui Pergerakan Amal, Hizbullah menjadi parti politik yang sah  mewakili masyarakat Syiah di Lubnan.  Hizbullah menjadi parti terbesar dan pengaruh yang kuat di Lubnan. 

Parti Hizbullah diktiraf oleh kerajaan dan dibenarkan menyertai Pilihan raya umum  bagi mengendurkan dan mengurangkan unsur militan dalam Hizbullah. Namun unsur militan Hizbullah tidak dapat dibendung sepenuhnya.  

Penduduk Lubnan terbahagi kepada Islam dan Kristian. Penduduk Islam dan Kristian sendiri bertempur sesama sendiri dan agak lama. Bagi mengendurkan pertelingkahan itu,  jawatan Presiden Lubnan diserahkan kepada puak Kristian dan jawatan Perdana Menteri diserahkan kepada puak Islam. 

Presiden Lubnan Emil Lahoud  merupakan seorang Kristian. Sementara Perdana Menteri Lubnan Fouad Siniora seorang Islam.

Parti Hizbullah menguasai 18% dalam pilihan raya Lubnan 2005. 23 dari 128 kerusi dimenangi oleh Hizbullah, kebanyakannya di bahagian selatan, yang bersempadan dengan utara Israel. Segelintir mereka ini sebenarnya pelarian Palestin sejak tahun 1948 lagi. Pelarian Palestin ini menyerap menjadi Hizbullah. Pada peringkat awal, pelarian Palestin tidak disenangi oleh  warga asal Lubnan sendiri.

Hizbullah yang dipimpin leh Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah menguasai segenap pemikiran dan keperluan masyarakat Syiah khususnya . Hospital , tadika, sekolah rendah, sekolah menengah dan  perkhidmatan berita disediakan oleh Hizbullah.  Pelbagai projek ekonomi dan kemudahan infrastruktur  telah dibina atas nama Hizbullah yang dipanggil 'Jihad al-Bina'. 

Malangnya perubahan sikap positif Hizbullah ini tidak disenangi oleh Israel. Israel terus-terusan melabelkan Hizbullah sebagai  pertubuhan pengganas atau 'teroris' . Amerika Syarikat, United Kingdom dan Kanada menyetujui cap pengganas ini.  Sebaliknya Kesatuan Eropah tidak menafikan Hizbullah sebagai pertubuhan pengganas , kecuali Imad Mugniyah .

Scholars differ as to when Hezbollah came to be a distinct entity. Some organizations list the official formation of the group as early as 1982 <ref> [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/hizballah.htm GlobalSecurity.org, 2005] </ref> whereas Diaz and Newman maintain that Hezbollah remained an amalgamation of various violent Shi’a extremists until as late as 1985 <ref> Diaz & Newman, 2005, p. 55 </ref>. Another version states that it was formed by supporters of Sheikh Ragheb Harb, a leader of the southern Shiite resistance killed by Israel in 1984.<ref>Helena Cobban, Boston Review [http://bostonreview.net/BR30.2/cobban.html Hizbullah’s New Face] Accessed August 14 2006</ref>

Ending combat with the ousted from Jordan. The PLO had been attacking Israel from Southern Lebanon in the lead-up to the 1982 Lebanon War, and Israel had invaded and occupied Southern Lebanon and besieged Beirut.

Then Hezbollah tried to expel Israel from Lebanon.

==Ideology==

On February 16, 1985, Sheik Ibrahim al-Amin issued Hezbollah's manifesto. According to this manifesto (titled "An Open Letter: The Hizballah Program"), the three objectives of the organization are:<ref name="The Hizballah Program"/>
<blockquote>
* To expel Americans, the French and their allies (sic) definitely from Lebanon, putting an end to any colonialist entity on our land.
* To submit the phalanges to a just power and bring them all to justice for the crimes they have perpetrated against Muslims and Christians.
* To permit all the sons of our people to determine their future and to choose in all the liberty the form of government they desire. We call upon all of them to pick the option of Islamic government which alone is capable of guaranteeing justice and liberty for all. Only an Islamic regime can stop any future tentative attempts of imperialistic infiltration onto our country.
</blockquote><!-- Note the above is not an exact quote: the Standbyus document uses (a), (b), (c) instead of bullets, a "the" is missing and punctuation is different. --> The 1985 manifesto makes it clear that Hezbollah intends to use armed force to achieve these goals and phrases its argument for this measure through the language of defensive jihad.<ref>Qassem, (2005) page 39</ref> 

===Hezbollah's Shi'a Islamic doctrine===
Hezbollah was formed in the early 1980s, largely with the aid of the Willayat Al-Faqih”) developed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran.<ref name="HG20Ak02"/>

Translated excerpts from Hezbollah's original 1985 manifesto read:<blockquote><div>We are the sons of the umma (Muslim community) ...<br/>... We are an ummah linked to the Muslims of the whole world by the solid doctrinal and religious connection of Islam, whose message God wanted to be fulfilled by the Seal of the Prophets, i.e., Prophet legal principles laid down by the light of an overall political conception defined by the leading jurist....As for our culture, it is based on the Holy Quran, the Sunna and the legal rulings of the faqih who is our source of imitation...<ref name="The Hizballah Program"/></div></blockquote>

Although Hezbollah originally aimed to transform Lebanon into an multi-confessional quotas under the Ta'if Accord, due to the fact that Shia's position in the state is lower than its proportion of population. Hezbollah believes in a one-person-one-vote system, but does not intend to force it onto the other minorities.<ref name="cobbanBR30_2">Cobban, Helena [http://bostonreview.net/BR30.2/cobban.html "Hizbullah’s New Face."] ''Boston Review''.

Under this pretext, Hizballah, supported by some Lebanese parties, could argue that it is not a militia and thus it is outside the jurisdiction of Resolution 1559." Robert Rabil.

Our goal is to liberate the 1948 borders of Palestine, ... The Jews who survive this war of liberation can go back to Germany or wherever they came from. However, that the Jews who lived in Palestine before 1948 will be 'allowed to live as a minority and they will be cared for by the Muslim majority.'"<ref name="In the Party of God"></ref> </blockquote>

In a 2003 interview, Nasrallah answered questions concerning the renewed peace talks between the Palestinians and the Israelis, stating that he would not interfere in what he regarded as "...&nbsp;primarily a Palestinian matter." However, in his speeches to his followers, he provides rationalizations for suicide bombings.<ref name="hersh-New Yorker-030728fa"></ref> Similarly, in 2004, when asked whether he was prepared to live with a two-state settlement between Israel and Palestine, Nasrallah said again that he would not sabotage what is finally a "...&nbsp;Palestinian matter."<ref name="nybooks"/> He also said that outside of Lebanon, Hezbollah would act only in a defensive manner towards Israeli forces, and that Hezbollah's missiles were acquired to deter attacks on Lebanon.<ref></ref>

===Attitudes, statements, and actions concerning Jews and Judaism===
Hezbollah has declared that it distinguishes between Zionists.  Alagha concluded that Hezbollah is not anti-Semitic in its overall orientation.<ref>Alagha (2006), p.188</ref>

In a Pro-Palestinian Convention held in Beirut in 2005, Hezbollah representative in the Lebanese Parliament Abdallah Qussayr<ref>http://www.lebanonwire.com/parliament/members_2000.asp</ref> stated that "Hezbollah has never been against religions. Hezbollah supports all religions, it supports interfaith dialogue, and it has no problem with any religion.

According to the Israel Ministry of Foreigm Affairs, Hassan Nasrallah, speaking at the Shi'ite Moslem "Ashura" flagellation ceremony on April 9, 2000, said: “Anyone who reads the Koran and the holy writings of the monotheistic religions sees what they did to the prophets, and what acts of madness and slaughter the Jews carried out throughout history... Anyone who reads these texts cannot think of co-existence with them, of peace with them, or about accepting their presence, not only in Palestine of 1948 but even in a small village in Palestine, because they are a cancer which is liable to spread again at any moment.”<ref>http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2000/4/Excerpts%20from%20Speech%20by%20Hizbullah%20Secretary-Genera “Excerpts from Speech by Hizbullah Secretary-General Nasrallah - 9-Apr-2000“</ref> However, Hezbollah spokeswoman Wafa Hoteit denies that Nasrallah made the statement comparing Jews to cancer."<ref name="lrb_glass" />

==Organization==
thumb|right|Organizational chart of Hezbollah, by Ahmad Nizar Hamzeh.
At the beginning many Hezbollah leaders have maintained that the movement was "not an organization, for its members carry no cards and bear no specific responsibilities,"<ref>''al-Nahar al-Arabi walduwali'', 10-16 June 1985; and ''La Revue du Liban'', 27 July-3 August 1985. quoted in Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon,'' (1997), p.41</ref> and that the movement does not have "a clearly defined organizational structure."<ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon,'' (1997), p. 64</ref> 

Nowadays, as Hezbollah scholar Magnus Ranstorp reports, Hezbollah does indeed have a formal governing structure, and in keeping with the principle of velayat-e faqih, it "concentrate[s] ... all authority and powers" in its religious leaders, whose decisions then "flow from the ulama down the entire community." 

<Blockquote>The supreme decision-making bodies of the Hezbollah were divided between the Majlis al-Shura (Consultative Assembly) which was headed by 12 senior clerical members with responsibility for tactical decisions and supervision of overall Hizballah activity throughout Lebanon, and the Majlis al-Shura al-Karar (the Deciding Assembly), headed by Sheikh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah and composed of eleven other clerics with responsibility for all strategic matters. Within the Majlis al-Shura, there existed seven specialized committees dealing with ideological, financial, military and political, judicial, informational and social affairs. In turn, the Majlis al-Shura and these seven committees were replicated in each of Hizballah's three main operational areas (the Beqaa, Beirut, and the South).<ref name = "Ranstorp-p45">Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon,'' (1997), p.45</ref></blockquote>

Since the Supreme Leader of Iran is the ultimate clerical authority, Hezbollah's leaders have appealed to him "for guidance and directives in cases when Hezbollah's collective leadership [was] too divided over issues and fail[ed] to reach a consensus."<ref name = "Ranstorp-p45"/> After the death of Iran's first Supreme Leader, Khomeini, Hezbollah's governing bodies developed a more "independent role" and appealed to Iran less often.<ref name = "Ranstorp-p45"/>

== Military activities ==

Hezbollah has a military branch known as ''Al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya'' ("The Islamic Resistance") and is the possible sponsor of a number of lesser-known militant groups, some of which may be little more than fronts for Hezbollah itself, including the Organization of the Oppressed, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, the Organization of Right Against Wrong, and Followers of the Prophet Muhammad.<ref name='USDbackground2801'>

===Conflict with Israel===

Hezbollah has been involved in several cases of armed conflict with Israel:

* During the SLA, and the rapid advance of Hezbollah forces, they withdrew suddenly on May 24, 2000 six weeks before the announced 7 July."<ref name="Timeline: Lebanon"/> Hezbollah held a victory parade, and its popularity in Lebanon rose.<ref>See:
*
*</ref>
*  On July 25, 1993, following the killing of seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, Israel launched Operation Accountability (known in Lebanon as the Seven Day War), during which the IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on targets in southern Lebanon since 1982. The declared aim of the operation was to eradicate the threat posed by Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to put pressure on the Lebanese Government to repress Hezbollah. The fighting ended when an unwritten understanding was agreed to by the warring parties. Apparently, the 1993 understanding provided that Hezbollah combatants would not fire rockets at northern Israel, while Israel would not attack civilians or civilian targets in Lebanon.<ref></ref>
* In April 1996, the Israeli armed forces launched killed by the shelling of a  Grapes of Wrath Understandings on April 26, 1996. A cease-fire was agreed upon between Israel and Hezbollah, which would be effective on April 27, 1996. Both sides agreed that civilians should not be targeted, which meant that Hezbollah would be allowed to continue its military activities against IDF forces inside Lebanon.<ref name="cobbanBR30_2"/><ref></ref>
