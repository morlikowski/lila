'''The Beatles''' bola najvplyvnejšia a najúspešnejšia hudobná skupina rockovej éry. Predaj albumov The Beatles presiahol 1,3 miliardy nahrávok (údaj z roku 2004), čo je viac, ako dosiahol ktorýkoľvek iný umelec v dejinách. Len málo umelcov v rôznych obdobiach dosiahlo úspech, kritické ocenenia a široký kultúrny vplyv ako The Beatles.

== Beatles, beatlemánia a ich vplyv na populárnu hudbu ==

Členmi The Beatles boli John Lennon (rytmická gitara, ústna harmonika, spev), Paul McCartney (basová gitara, spev), George Harrison (sólová gitara, spev) a Ringo Starr (bicie, spev), všetci z Liverpoolu v Anglicku. Lennon a McCartney boli hlavnými autormi piesní, do repertoáru skupiny však pravidelne prispieval aj George Harrison a niekoľko piesní zložil aj bubeník Ringo Starr. Po väčšinu ich kariéry bol ich producentom George Martin, ktorému sa niekedy prisudzuje aj prívlastok "''piaty Beatle''".<ref>[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000583/George-Martin.html George Martin Biography na musicianguide.com ]</ref>

The Beatles sa stali senzáciou v Spojenom kráľovstve koncom roku Spojených štátoch a popularita skupiny obsiahla väčšinu planéty. V priebehu piatich rokov sa hudba Beatles vyvinula zo zjavnej jednoduchosti ich prvých hitov (ako ''She Loves You'' a ''I Want To Hold Your Hand'') k umelecky ambicióznym skupinám skladieb (ako albumy ''Revolver'', ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band'' a ''Abbey Road''). The Beatles dosiahli výrazný, ďalekosiahly vplyv na modernú populárnu hudbu, čo bolo dôsledkom niekoľkých faktorov: The Beatles písali svoje vlastné piesne, naplno využívali možnosti nahrávacích štúdií tej doby, no najmä sa neustále snažili o absolútnu kvalitu svojich nahrávok.

Skupina natočila aj niekoľko filmov, z toho tri hrané - ''A Hard Day's Night'', ''Help!'' a ''Magical Mystery Tour'', jeden pseudodokumentárny - ''Let It be'', a jeden animovaný - ''Yellow Submarine''.

V priebehu šesťdesiatych rokov 20. storočia sa členovia skupiny stali symbolickými vodcami medzinárodnej ''antikultúry'' mládeže, verejne experimentovali s východným mysticizmom, psychedelickými drogami a revolučnými politickými názormi. Skupina sa rozpadla v roku 1970.

== História ==

John Lennon založil skifflovú skupinu pomenovanú ''The Quarrymen'' v lete roku 1956. 6. júla 1957 sa stretol v priebehu vystúpenia s Paulom McCartneym a čoskoro začali spoločne hrávať. V roku 1958 sa ku skupine pridal mladý gitarista George Harrison. V roku 1960 spoločne odcestovali do Hamburgu, kde sa následne stali The Beatles. V marci roku 1961 začali nahrávať, avšak pod menom Beat Brothers[http://www.dunaj.sk/store/GoodsDetail.asp?sCGoodsID=SK00036485&sAction=Forum]. V tom období (do roku 1962) bol členom skupiny aj Stuart Sutcliffe, ktorý ovplyvnil najmä výzor členov skupiny a ich zmysel pre štýl. Skupina mala v rannom štádiu viacerých manažérov, v roku 1962 sa manažérom stal natrvalo Brian Epstein.

V roku 1962 sa skupina dostala pod krídla značky Parlophone (súčasť EMI) a bubeník skupiny Pete Best bol narýchlo vyhodený a nahradený skúsenejším Ringo Starrom. 

''Beatlemánia'' prepukla v Spojenom kráľovstve 13. októbra 9., 16. a 23. februára 1964. Popová skupina sa stala celosvetovým fenoménom, keď ju na jednej strane zbožňovali davy, a na strane druhej ňou iní opovrhovali, napr. aj Frank Sinatra, či už kvôli hudbe (považovanej za hrubú a nemuzikálnu) alebo výzoru (škandalózne dlhým vlasom).

V roku 1964 mali The Beatles v americkej hitparáde ''Billboard Hot 100'' simultánne päť piesní na prvých piatich miestach. Takáto udalosť sa už v populárnej hudbe nikdy neopakovala.

V roku 1965 dostali členovia skupiny rad MBE - boli vymenovaní členmi rádu britského impéria. Lennon a Harrison začali v tom čase experimentovať s LSD a zakrátko sa k nim pridal aj McCartney. V roku 1966 spôsobil Lennon značnú kontroverziu, keď sa v interview vyjadril, že kresťanstvo je na ústupe a dodal, že Beatles „sú populárnejší ako Ježiš“. V konečnom dôsledku bol donútený sa ospravedlniť, po tom čo bol za svoje slová odsúdený mnohými náboženskými organizáciami a dokonca Vatikánom, platne Beatles boli zakazované a pálené a skupina dostávala vyhrážky od skupín ako Ku Klux Klan.

Posledný koncert The Beatles pre platiacich divákov sa konal v San Francisku 29. augusta 1966. Následne sa skupina zamerala na štúdiovú tvorbu a ich neskoršie kompozície a hudobné experimenty zvýšili ich umeleckú prestíž, pričom si stále zachovali ohromnú popularitu.

Po smrti Briana Epsteina v roku 1967 sa členovia skupiny od seba začali vzďaľovať a finančná situácia skupiny, resp. skupinou vlastnených spoločností sa začala zhoršovať, čo bol primárne dôsledok nesprávneho riadenia.

Za ich posledný „koncert“ je považované vystúpenie na streche štúdií Apple v januári 1969 počas nahrávania albumu neskôr známeho ako ''Let It Be''. V priebehu toho roku skupina tiež natočila svoj posledný album, ''Abbey Road'', ktorý však bol vydaný ešte pred ''Let It Be''.

Skupina sa oficiálne rozpadla v apríli v roku 1970 a po násilnej smrti Johna Lennona v roku 1980 vyprchali všetky nádeje na neskoršie znovuzjednotenie. Napriek tomu k opätovnému virtuálnemu zjednoteniu došlo v roku 1995, keď zvyšní členovia skupiny dotvorili dve staršie Lennonove nahrávky, ''Free As A Bird'' a ''Real Love''. Tieto piesne boli vydané ako súčasť projektu troch dvojalbumov zložených z nevydaných materiálov a štúdiových nahrávok, dokumentárneho filmu a televízneho seriálu; tento projekt je známy ako ''The Beatles Anthology''.

== Vývoj štúdiového štýlu ==
náhľad|250px|Štúdiá ''Abbey Road'', kde skupina nahrala rovnomenný album.
Producent George Martin zohral kľúčovú úlohu pri formovaní úspechu The Beatles. S prispením svojich skúseností rozpoznal a podporil potenciál skupiny, pričom iní, menej skúsení producenti by sa pravdepodobne snažili presadzovať vlastné názory a potlačovať kreativitu hudobníkov. Bol tiež pripravený na otvorený, experimentálny prístup k práci v štúdiu, ktorý si The Beatles začali vytvárať, keď získali viac skúseností.

Na vrchole kariéry v polovici šesťdesiatych rokov a natočení dvoch filmov - ''A Hard Day's Night'' a ''Help!'' - skupina prestala koncertovať. Zložitosť vystúpení pred tisíckami jačiacich fanúšikov, ktorí väčšinou prehlušovali hudbu viedla k strate ilúzií z turné a v roku 1966 prestali The Beatles celkom koncertovať s úmyslom sústrediť sa na nahrávanie platní.

Požiadavky skupiny na vytvorenie nového zvuku s každou novou nahrávkou, vplyv psychedelických drog a štúdiové postupy zvukového inžiniera Geoffa Emericka vyústili do albumov ''Revolver'' (1966) a ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band'' (1967), ktoré sú dodnes považované za klasiku. Rovnako dôležité ako použitie štúdiových trikov (skresľovanie zvuku, neobvyklé postavenie mikrofónov, zmena rýchlosti nahrávania) boli v tom období pre tvorbu The Beatles aj hudobné nástroje nekonvenčné v populárnej hudbe, ako sláčikové nástroje, dychové nástroje a indické hudobné nástroje. The Beatles tiež začali používať elektronické hudobné nástroje a zvukové slučky.

Skupina čoraz viac viedla svoje vlastné nahrávania a postupná dominancia Paula McCartneyho v tomto procese zohrala úlohu v prehlbovaní napätia medzi členmi skupiny, ktoré v konečnom dôsledku viedlo až k rozpadu.

Stres sa začínal prejavovať v období vydania ''The Beatles'' (tzv. Bieleho albumu z roku 1968), pričom v tom období niektoré skladby natočili jednotliví členovia skupiny samostatne. Ringo Starr si v priebehu nahrávania dokonca vybral „dvojtýždňovú dovolenku“, čo bolo dokonca považované za dočasný odchod od kapely. V roku 1970 sa skupina definitívne rozpadla a jednotliví členovia sa začali - s rôznou mierou úspechu - naplno venovať sólovým kariéram.

== Beatles vo filme ==

Prvý film The Beatles, ''A Hard Day's Night'' z roku 1964 bol čiernobielou komédiou natočenou režisérom Dickom Lesterom v dokumentárnom štýle. Film zobrazuje beatlemániu a členov skupiny ako obete vlastnej slávy. Tretí album The Beatles, rovnako pomenovaný ''A Hard Day's Night'' je soundtrackom tohoto fimu. Bol to zároveň prvý album The Beatles, ktorého všetky piesne boli napísané duom Lennon/McCartney.

Po úspechu prvého filmu natočili The Beatles s Dickom Lesterom ''Help!'' (1965), už farebnú komédiu o prenasledovaní Ringa členmi ázijského kultu v snahe získať jeho prsteň. Rovnako k tomuto filmu vydala skupina album s rovnomenným názvom.

Tretí film, televízny ''Magical Mystery Tour'' (1967), je o autobusovom výlete členov skupiny na anglický vidiek, pričom osádka autobusu stretáva rôzne obskúrne postavičky. Tento film je podľa mnohých silne ovplyvnený užívaním LSD a členovia skupiny, najmä McCartney, vyzerajú byť na obrazovke pod vplyvom drog. Film bol pôvodne odmietnutý rovnako kritikou i divákmi, dnes je však považovaný za klasiku avantgardy.

''Yellow Submarine'' (1968) je animovaný film s pestrými farbami o The Beatles zachraňujúcich krajinu ''Pepperland'' pred „modrákmi“ nenávidiacimi hudbu. Samotní členovia skupiny vo filme nehrajú, objavia sa až v záverečnej scéne filmu. The Beatles opäť vydali rovnomenný soundtrack, pričom nahrali len prvú stranu albumu, druhá pozostávala z orchestrálnych skladieb ich producenta Georgea Martina.

Dokumentárny film ''Let It Be'' (natočený v roku 1969, v kinách v roku 1970) zachytáva skupinu v smrteľnom kŕči. Kamera sleduje The Beatles v štúdiu pri nahrávaní, skúšaní, pri rozhovoroch a hádkach. Z filmu je zreteľné ako blízko k rozpadu už skupina mala. Film však zachytáva i príjemné momenty, ako napr. posledný „koncert“ skupiny na streche nahrávacieho štúdia. Film sa dostal do kín až po ohlásení rozpadu skupiny a pre fanúšikov bol sklamaním.

== Vplyvy a hudba ==

Mladí Beatles boli úprimnými fanúšikmi Elvisa Presleyho. Imponovali im nielen jeho vystúpenia, ale najmä pozornosť, ktorej sa mu dostávalo zo strany ženského publika. Neskôr sa McCartney vyjadril, že „vidieť Elvisa bolo ako vidieť príchod mesiáša“. The Beatles nahrali množstvo Presleyho piesní, ale do rozpadu skupiny neboli žiadne vydané.

Vplyv na hudbu The Beatles mali najmä americkí rockeri, v prvom rade Chuck Berry. Berryho piesne ''Roll Over Beethoven'' a ''Rock and Roll Music'' sa objavili na prvých albumoch skupiny a ďalšie hrávali pravidelne počas živých vystúpení. Vplyv Berryho na hudbu The Beatles pretrval až do neskorých rokov existenie skupiny a je zreteľný napr. v piesňach ''Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey'' (1968) a ''Come Together'' (1969).

'''The Beatles''' were a pop and rock group from genres ranging from Tin Pan Alley to psychedelic rock. Their clothes, styles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon solo careers.

The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the history of popular music and the best-selling musical group in history.<ref>http://uktv.co.uk/history/gallery/aid/601378/multipageid/5823 The Beatles' First Recording</ref> In the singles, albums, and EPs that reached number one, earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history.<ref>http://www.licensing.biz/brand-profiles/16/The-Beatles The Beatles</ref> This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company, EMI, estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide.<ref name="Worldwide sales"></ref> According to the Recording Industry Association of America, The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band.<ref name="riaa"></ref> In 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of <span class="plainlinks">[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty/ 100 Greatest Artists of All Time]</span>.<ref></ref> According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today.

==History==
=== 1957–60: Formation ===

In March 1957, while attending Quarry Bank Grammar School in bass in January 1960.<ref name="Coleman p212">Coleman (1984), p.212</ref><ref name="CynthiaJohnp66">Lennon (2006), p.66</ref> 

The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including "Johnny and the Moondogs" and "Long John and The Beatles". Sutcliffe suggested the name "The Beetles" as a tribute to Johnny Gentle in Scotland, the band changed their name to "The Beatles." Lennon's first wife Cynthia Lennon suggested that Lennon came up with the name The Beatles at a "brainstorming session over a beer-soaked table in the Renshaw Hall bar."<ref name="CynthiaJohnp65"> Lennon (2006), p.65</ref> Lennon, who was well known for giving multiple versions of the same story, joked in a 1961 ''Mersey Beat'' magazine article that "It came in a vision — a man appeared on a flaming pie and said unto them, 'From this day on you are Beatles with an A'".<ref name="Davies p42">Davies (1985), p.42</ref> During an interview in 2001, McCartney took credit for the peculiar spelling of the name, saying that "John had the idea of calling us the Beetles; I said, 'How about the ''Beatles''; you know, like the beat of the drum?' At the time, everyone was stoned enough to find it hilarious. It's funny how history is made."<ref name=" OBrienp22">O'Brien (2001), p.22</ref>

In May 1960, the then-Silver Beetles toured northeast Scotland as a back-up band with singer Johnny Gentle, whom the band had met an hour before their first gig.<ref name="Coleman p212" /> McCartney referred to the tour as a great experience for the band.<ref name="SpitzPage188-193"> Spitz (2005), pp.188–193</ref> For the tour, the often drummer-less group secured the services of Tommy Moore, who was considerably older than the others.<ref name="Lewisohn92">Lewisohn (1992), p.92</ref> Moore left the band soon after the tour and went back to work in a bottling factory as a forklift truck driver.<ref name="Coleman213">Ray (1984), p.213</ref> Norman Chapman was the band's next drummer, but was called up for National Service a few weeks later. His departure posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager, Allan Williams, had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the Reeperbahn in Hamburg, West Germany.<ref name="Lewisohn215">Lewisohn (1992), p.215</ref>

===1960–62: Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein===
Finding themselves without a drummer before their upcoming engagement in Hamburg, the group invited Pete Best to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. Best had played with The Blackjacks in The Casbah Coffee Club, owned by Pete's mother, Mona Best; a cellar club in West Derby, Liverpool, The Beatles played there and often visited.<ref name="Blackjacks"></ref> Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began playing in Hamburg at the Indra Club and moved to the Kaiserkeller in October 1960. They were required to play six or seven hours a night, seven nights a week. On 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age.<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnPage93">Lennon (2006), p.93</ref> A week later, having started a small fire at their living quarters while vacating it for more luxurious rooms, McCartney and Best were arrested, charged with arson, and deported.<ref name=Lewisohn24> Lewisohn (1992), p.24</ref> Lennon followed the others to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr. The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with Chas Newby substituting for Sutcliffe.<ref name="SpitzPage4-5"> Spitz (2005), pp.4–5</ref> 
left|thumb|The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appears today.
The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the "backing band on a series of recordings for the German bass duties.<ref name="MilesPage74"> Miles (1998), p.74 It was Astrid Kirchherr who shot the famous black and white headshots, but contrary to popular belief, did not invent the distinctive haircut of the group</ref>

The band returned to Liverpool from Germany, and on Tuesday, February 21, 1961, they  made their first lunchtime appearance at The Cavern Club in Mathew Street.  Their stage show had been through a lot of changes, and some in the audience thought they were watching a German band. From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club. On 9 November 1961, Brian Epstein, owner of the NEMS music store on Great Charlotte Street, saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. 

In a meeting with the group at North End Music Store (NEMS) on Star Club.<ref name="LewisohnChronicle69">Lewisohn (1996), p.69</ref> Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a brain hemorrhage.<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnp109"> Lennon (2006), p.109</ref>

===1962: Record contract===
After failing to impress Decca Records, Epstein went to the HMV store on Oxford Street in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, recording engineer Jim Foy referred him to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. When Coleman heard the demo tapes, he suggested taking the tapes to George Martin who, Coleman explained, "does comedy records" and headed the Parlophone label at EMI. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI on a one-year renewable contract.<ref name="Milesp90"> Miles (1997), p.90</ref> The Beatles' first recording session was scheduled for 6 June 1962 at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in north London.<ref name="Daviesp178">Davies (1985), p.178</ref> Martin had not been particularly impressed by the band's demo recordings, but he liked The Beatles' personalities when he met them.<ref name="Spitzp318"> Spitz (2005), p.318</ref> He concluded that they had raw musical talent, but stated in later interviews that what made the difference for him was their wit and humour.<ref name="Spitzp318-319"> Spitz (2005), pp.318–319</ref>

Martin had a problem with Pete Best,<ref name="Spitzp318"> Spitz (2005), p.318</ref> whom he criticised for not being able to keep time. Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. There was speculation by some that Best's popularity with fans was another source of friction.<ref name="Spitzp322"> Spitz (2005), p.322</ref> In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best also had missed a number of engagements because of illness. The three founding members of the band enlisted Epstein to dismiss Best, which he did on Richard Starkey, known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for one of the top Andy White for their next session on P.S. I Love You", found on The Beatles' first album.

Their recording contract paid them one penny for each single sold, which was split amongst the four Beatles — one farthing per group member.<ref name="History62">[http://plzdontshoot.us/beatles-discography-1962.html] Mirror of "Beatles History: 1962"  at ''Beatles Discography''. Retrieved: 29 January 2007</ref> This royalty rate was reduced for singles sold outside the UK, for which they received half of one penny (again split between the whole band) per single. Martin said later that it was a "pretty awful" contract.<ref name="History62" />

The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions a few months later produced a minor UK hit "Love Me Do", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen.<ref> [http://oldies.about.com/od/britishinvasion/a/lovemedo.htm Love Me Do] Retrieved: 29 January 2007 </ref> "Love Me Do" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart over eighteen months later in May 1964.

===1962–63: Fame in the UK===
On Please Please Me", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the NME chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled ''Please Please Me'' (1962). The band's first televised performance was on the ''People and Places'' programme, transmitted live from Manchester by Granada Television on 17 October 1962.<ref name="Harryp516">Harry (2000), p.516</ref> As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group, predominantly from teenage female fans, was dubbed "Beatlemania".

The band also began to be noticed by serious music critics. On Aeolian cadence at the end of 'Mahler's 'Song of the Earth')."<ref name="pedlerp123">Pedler (2003), p.123</ref>

===1963–64: American success===
Although the band experienced huge popularity on the British record charts in early 1963, EMI's American operation, WLS, placed "Please Please Me" into radio rotation in late February 1963, arguably the first time a Beatles record was heard on American radio. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties.<ref> Retrieved: 29 January 2007 </ref>

In August 1963, Philadelphia-based distinctive hairstyles.<ref name="Spitzp461"> Spitz (2005), p.461</ref> In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded Silver Spring, Maryland to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's WWDC radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single "I Want to Hold Your Hand" sent over to him in Washington DC. Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963.<ref>[http://oldies.about.com/od/britishinvasion/a/holdyourhand.htm I Want to Hold Your Hand] Retrieved: 29 January 2007.</ref>

Several New York radio stations began playing "I Want to Hold Your Hand" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964, ''Cashbox'' magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January. Aware that ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' was scheduled to present The Beatles live in early February, the ''Jack Paar Show'' licensed a film clip of The Beatles performing "She Loves You" from Britain's BBC and aired the footage on 3 January 1964, enabling Paar to claim that he had beaten rival Sullivan to showing The Beatles on a network TV show.

On John F. Kennedy Airport, they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans.<ref name="Spitzp459"> Spitz (2005), p.459</ref> After a press conference, where they first met disc jockey Murray the K, The Beatles were put into limousines and driven to New York City.

After The Beatles' success in 1964, My Bonnie" and "Ain't She Sweet", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to ''Introducing... The Beatles'' (1964), which was essentially The Beatles' debut British album with some minor alterations, Vee-Jay also issued an unusual LP called ''The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons''. This 2-LP set paired ''Introducing... The Beatles'' and ''The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons'', another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the ''Hear The Beatles Tell All'' album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled "Dave Hull interviews John Lennon", while side two was titled "Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo"). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.

The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release ''Rarities'' compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged.<ref>[http://www.rarebeatles.com/photospg/vj581.htm Rare Beatles] Retrieved: 29 January 2007 </ref> The Swan tracks "She Loves You" and "I'll Get You" were issued on the Capitol LP ''The Beatles' Second Album''.

===1966: Backlash and controversy===
In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the Philippines, they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace.<ref name="Spitzp619"> Spitz (2005), p.619</ref> When presented with the invitation, Brian Epstein politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such "official" invitations.<ref name="Spitzp620"> Spitz (2005), p.620</ref> The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting "no" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to Manila airport on their own. At the airport, road manager Mal Evans was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd.<ref name="Spitzp623"> Spitz (2005), p.623</ref> Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, "Tell my wife that I love her."<ref name="Spitzp624"> Spitz (2005), p.624</ref> Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane.<ref name="Spitzp625"> Spitz (2005), p.625</ref>

Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave,<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/10/05/bmlennon05.xml "The John Lennon I Knew"] from ''The Telegraph'', 5 October 2006.

"How Does a Beatle Live? John Lennon Lives Like This". London ''Evening Standard'' 4 March 1966.</ref>  Afterwards, a radio station in Birmingham, Alabama, ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the American South started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, "They've got to buy them before they can burn them."<ref></ref> Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour.<ref name="MilesPage293-295"> Miles (1998), pp.293-295</ref>

The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a ''Yesterday and Today'' album and a poster promoting the UK release of "Paperback Writer", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and plastic dolls. A popular, though apocryphal, rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had "butchered" their albums.<ref>[http://www.beatlesstory.com/ The Beatles Story], Liverpool.

They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."<ref>Peter Guralnick, ''Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley'', p.420</ref> Guralnick adds, "Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."<ref>Guralnick, ''Careless Love'', p.426 On Presley badmouthing The Beatles to President Nixon, see also Geoffrey Giuliano and Vmda Devi, ''Glass Onion: The Beatles in Their Own Words-Exclusive Interviews With John, Paul, George, Ringo and Their Inner Circle'' (1999)</ref> Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: "Before Elvis, there was nothing."<ref> CNN.com ''Elvis is still everywhere'' August 16, 2002.

These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "Martha My Dear", "Wild Honey Pie", "Dear Prudence" and "Back in the USSR". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend, Yoko Ono, was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant.<ref name="Spitzpp777-779">Spitz (2005), pp.777–779</ref> Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.

On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager Linda). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the ''Anthology'' interviews, McCartney said, "Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them"). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen £5 million from The Beatles' holdings.

Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's ''Ringo'' (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs.

There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled ''Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962'', which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape.
