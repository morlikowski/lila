Apu is proprietor of the '''immigrant from indefatigable immigrant work ethic. His catchphrase is "Thank you, come again!" — cheerfully and dutifully repeated to customers (no matter how unpleasant) after each transaction, even after the store has been robbed or he has ejected unwanted customers. Apu is a strict Snake Jailbird. As the proprietor of the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu charges high prices for low-quality products which are often past their shelf life or otherwise unfit to consume. Apu seems to be the only person to know about the quality of the food, as he refuses to eat it, even when trapped inside the Kwik-E-Mart for 96 hours (near the end he thought he was a hummingbird).<ref name=homerapu/> Since the Kwik-E-Mart is open 24 hours and on holidays, and Apu is usually the only employee, it is important to him to never close and to never leave his shift. On the rare times the store has to close, signs are posted saying such things as "We’re never closed (except today)" or "Closed for the first time ever".<ref></ref>

'''Apu Nahasapeemapetilon Jr.''', fil. dr, är en fiktiv karaktär i den amerikanska animerade TV-serien ''The Simpsons'', spelad av Hank Azaria.

Apu är ägare till butiken Manjula och deras åttlingar Anoop, Uma, Nabendu, Poonam, Priya, Sandeep, Shashi och Gheet ("Mammas klara favorit"). Apu är hindu och är högst troligen av tamilsk härkomst, med tanke på hans efternamn.

Han blev bortlovad till Manjula redan som barn, och blev förälskad i henne när de skulle planera otrogen; det slutade med att han blev utkastad av sin hustru men fick senare komma tillbaka. Han var också medlem i Homers band ''The Be Sharps'' och är vän med Linda och Paul McCartney. Han påstår att han är vegan men i många avsnitt äter han kött.
