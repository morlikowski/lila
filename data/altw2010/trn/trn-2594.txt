The '''North Sea''' is a marginal, epeiric sea of the Atlantic Ocean on the European continental shelf.  It is more than  long and  wide, with an area of around . A large part of the European drainage basin empties into the North Sea including water from the Baltic Sea. The North Sea connects with the rest of the Atlantic through the Dover Strait and the English Channel in the south and through the Norwegian Sea in the north.

The North Sea averages about 100&nbsp;m (325&nbsp;ft) deep, with a maximum depth of 700&nbsp;m (2300&nbsp;ft) and in some areas shallows can be a mere 15&nbsp;m deep. The North Sea lies above what used to be the triple junction between three continental tectonic plates in the early glacial movements rather than dikes have been constructed to protect coastal areas.

The development of European civilization has been heavily affected by the maritime traffic on the North Sea. The Romans and the Vikings sought to extend their territory across the sea. Both the Hanseatic League and the Netherlands sought to dominate commerce on the North Sea and through it to access the markets of the world. Britain's development as a sea power depended heavily upon its dominance in the North Sea, where some of its rivals sought power, first the Netherlands and finally Germany and to a lesser extent Russia and the Scandinavian nations. Commercial enterprises, growing populations, and limited resources gave the nations on the North Sea the desire to control or access the North Sea for their own commercial, military, and colonial ends.

Its importance has turned from the military to the economic. Traditional economic activities, such as fishing and shipping, have continued to grow and other resources, such as fossil fuels and wind energy, have been discovered and developed.

==Naming==
The name of the North Sea originates from its relationship to the land of the East Sea'' (''Oostzee'', the Baltic Sea), to the north of the former ''South Sea'' (''Zuiderzee'', today's reclaimed ''Middle Sea'' (''Middelzee''). The name “North Sea” is attested in Middle High German and probably harks back to the name given by the Frisians, who settled on its south coast. Even the early Spanish name was ''Mar del Norte''.<ref>{{Citation

From the point of view of the German Hanseatic towns of the Middle Ages, the sea to the east was the “East Sea” (Baltic Sea in German is literally the ''Ostsee''), and the sea to the north, the North Sea. The spread of maps used by Hanseatic merchants popularized this name throughout Europe. Other common names in use for long periods were ''Mare Frisia'', and ''Mare Frisicum'', ''Oceanum-'' or ''Mare Germanicum'' as well as their English equivalents, Frisian Sea and German Ocean or Sea.

"German Sea" or "Germanic Sea"<ref> "The North Sea was known as the German Ocean until the early 20th C., when hostilities with Germany meant this name became politically unacceptable in Great Britain." [http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/scotgaz/features/featurefirst7877.html]</ref> (from the Latin ''Mare Germanicum'') was commonly used in English and other languages along with "North Sea", until the early eighteenth century. By the late nineteenth century, both "German-" and "Germanic Sea" were rare, scholarly usages.

==History==

===Early history===
The first records of marine traffic on the North Sea come from the Roman Empire, which began exploring the sea in 12 BC.  Great Britain was formally invaded in 43 AD and its southern areas incorporated into the Empire, beginning sustained trade across the North Sea and the English Channel.  The Romans abandoned Britain in 410 and in the power vacuum they left, the Germanic Angles, Saxons, and Jutes began the next great migration across the North Sea during the Migration Period, conquering and displacing the native Celtic populations.<ref>{{Citation

thumb|right|250px|Viking expansion and raiding by century
The Viking Age began in 793 with the attack on Lindisfarne and for the next quarter-millennium the Vikings ruled the North Sea.  In their superior longships, they raided, traded, and established colonies and outposts on the Sea's coasts. 

As Viking dominance waned, trade on the North Sea came to be controlled by the Hanseatic League.  The League, though centred on the Baltic Sea, had important outposts on the North Sea.   Goods from all over the world flowed through the North Sea on their way to and from the Hanseatic cities.  

By 1441, the Netherlands had risen as an economic and shipping power to rival the League.  By the 16th Century, the Netherlands were the leading economic power.  The North Sea was a hotbed of commerce and shipping connecting far-flung colonies with markets all over Europe.

===Early modern history===
thumb|200px|Painting of the [[Four Days Battle of 1666 by Willem van de Velde]]
Dutch power during her Golden Age was a concern for growing England, which saw its future in the merchant marine and overseas colonies.  This conflict was at the root of the first three Anglo-Dutch Wars between 1652 and 1673.  By the end of the War of Spanish Succession in 1714, the Dutch were no longer a major player in European politics. 

Britain's naval supremacy faced its only real challenge before the 20th Century from Napoleonic France and her continental allies.  In 1800, a union of lesser naval powers, called the League of Armed Neutrality, formed to protect neutral trade during Britain's conflict with France.  The British Navy defeated the combined forces of the League of Armed Neutrality in the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801 in the Kattegat.  Britain later defeated the French Navy in the Battle of Trafalgar off the coast of Spain.

===20th Century===
right|thumb|200px|The German Cruiser [[SMS Blücher sinks in the Battle of Dogger Bank on 25 January 1915. ]]
Tensions in the North Sea were again heightened in 1904 by the alliance with Japan and the Russo-Japanese War led to an intense diplomatic crisis.  The crisis was defused when Russia was defeated by the Japanese and agreed to pay compensation to the fishermen.

During the theatre of the war for surface action.  Britain's larger fleet was able to establish an effective blockade for most of the war that restricted the Battle of the Dogger Bank, the Battle of Jutland, and the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. Britain, though not always tactically successful, maintained the blockade and thus kept the High Seas Fleet in port.  Conversely, the German navy remained a threat that kept the vast majority of Britain's capital ships in the North Sea.

After the war, the North Sea lost much of its military significance because it is bordered only by NATO member-states.  The North Sea gained significant economic meaning in the 1960s as the states on the North Sea began to exploit its oil and gas resources.

===Political status===
right|thumb|200px|The [[Exclusive Economic Zones in the North Sea]]
The countries bordering the North Sea all claim the twelve nautical miles of territorial waters within which they have exclusive fishing rights. Iceland, however, as a result of the Cod Wars has exclusive fishing rights for 200&nbsp;mi (320&nbsp;km) from its coast, into parts of the North Sea. The Common Fisheries Policy of the EU exists to coordinate fishing rights and assist with disputes between EU states and the EU border state of Norway.

After the discovery of mineral resources in the North Sea, Norway claimed its rights under the Continental Shelf Convention. The other countries on the sea followed suit. These rights are largely divided along the median line.  The median line is defined as the line "every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points of the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each State is measured."<ref>{{Citation

Environmental concerns led to the MARPOL 73/78 Accords, which created  and 50&nbsp;mi (40 and 80&nbsp;km) zones of protection. The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic is established for the preservation of the ocean in the region. Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands have a trilateral agreement for the protection of the Wadden Sea, or mudflats, which run along the coasts of the three countries on the southern edge of the North Sea.

==Geography==
right|thumb|200px|The North Sea
For the most part, the sea lies on the European continental shelf. The only exception is a narrow area of the northern North Sea off Norway. The North Sea is bounded by Great Britain to the west and the northern and central European mainland to the east and south, including Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.

In the south-west, the North Sea becomes the English Channel beyond the Straits of Dover. In the east, it connects to the Baltic Sea via the Skagerrak and Kattegat. In the north, it opens in a widening funnel shape to the Norwegian Sea, which lies in the very north-eastern part of the Atlantic.

Apart from the obvious boundaries formed by the coasts of the countries which border it, the North Sea is generally considered to be bounded by an imaginary line from Lindesnes, Norway to Hanstholm, Denmark running towards the Skagerrak. However, for statistical purposes, the Skagerrak and the Kattegat are sometimes included as part of the North Sea.<ref></ref>  The northern limit is less well-defined. Traditionally, an imaginary line is taken to run from northern Scotland, by way of Shetland, to Ålesund in Norway.

The bed of the North Sea forms two basins. The main northern one lies to the north of a ridge between Norfolk and Frisia, and had its origin in the Devonian. The southern basin, if not flooded, would drain towards the Strait of Dover and thence to the English Channel. This basin dates from the Carboniferous.<ref></ref>

During the most recent glaciation, the Devensian much of the northern basin was covered by the ice sheet, and the remainder, including the southern basin, was tundra. However, during the Cromerian interglacial, there was a natural dam of chalk, the Weald-Artois Anticline."<ref>{{Citation

===Plate tectonics===
thumb|right|200px|The North Sea lies over the triple suture of what used to be three separate continents in the Paleozoic
The North Sea lies above what used to be the triple junction between three continental tectonic plates in the early Paleozoic Era. Later, in the Mesozoic Era, a North-South trending rift valley or graben formed down the middle of the North Sea. Fault lines along the English Channel cause occasional earthquakes, which can result in damage to structures on land. The axial grabens of the North Sea also form a tectonically active area.

The salt movement at depth.

"The Long Forties" denotes an area of the northern North Sea that is fairly consistently forty fathoms (73&nbsp;m) deep (thus, on a nautical chart with depth shown in fathoms, a long area with many "40" notations). It is located between the northeast coast of Scotland and the southwest coast of Norway, centred about 57°N 0°30′E.

The Broad Fourteens are an area of the southern North Sea that is fairly consistently fourteen fathoms (26&nbsp;m) deep (thus a broad area with many "14" notations). It is located off the coast of the Netherlands and south of the Dogger Bank, roughly between longitude 3°E and 4°30′E and latitude 52°30′N and 53°30′N.

Around the edges of the North Sea are a number of sizable islands and Frisian islands.

Copepods and other zooplankton are plentiful in the North Sea.  These tiny organisms are crucial elements of the food chain supporting many species of fish.  The North Sea is home to about 230 species of fish.  Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, mackerel, herring, pouting, sprat, and sandeel are all very common and the target of commercial fishing.<ref> {{Citation

Crustaceans are also commonly found throughout the sea.  Norway lobster, deep-water prawns, and brown shrimp are all commercially fished, but other species of lobster, shrimp, oyster, mussels and clams are all found.

===Birds===
The coasts of the North Sea are home to habitat for dozens of bird species.  Tens of millions of birds make use of the North Sea for breeding, feeding, or migratory stopovers every year.  Populations of Northern fulmars, Black-legged Kittiwakes, Atlantic puffins, razorbills, and a variety of species of petrels, gannets, seaducks, loons (divers), cormorants, gulls, auks, and terns, and many other seabirds make these coasts popular for birdwatching.<ref>

The parts per thousand (ppt) around river mouths and up to 32 to 35 ppt in the northern North Sea,<ref Name="Statistics1"/> still generally lower than North Atlantic salinity, which averages around 35 ppt.

The water temperature varies depending on the influence of the Atlantic currents, water depth, and time of year, reaching 21&nbsp;°C (77&nbsp;°F) in summer and 6&nbsp;°C (50&nbsp;°F) in winter, though Arctic currents can be colder. The eastern side is both the warmest in summer and the coldest in winter. In the deeper northern North Sea, the water remains a nearly constant 10&nbsp;°C (50&nbsp;°F) year round because of water exchange with the Atlantic. The greatest temperature variations are found on the very shallow Wadden Sea coast, where ice can form in very cold winters.<ref Name="Statistics1"/>

The exchange of salt water between the North Sea and Atlantic occurs through the English Channel, as well as in the northern North Sea along the Scottish coast and through the Norwegian Sea. The North Sea receives fresh water not only from inflow of rivers but also from the low salinity Baltic Sea which drains into the North Sea via the Skagerrak. The North Sea rivers drain a land area of 841,500&nbsp;km² (324,905&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and supply 296-354&nbsp;km³ (71-85&nbsp;cu&nbsp;mi) of fresh water annually. The Baltic rivers drain almost twice as large an area (1,650,000&nbsp;km², 637,068&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and contribute 470&nbsp;km³ (113&nbsp;cu&nbsp;mi) of fresh water annually.<ref Name="Statistics1"/>

Around 185 million people live in the catchment area of the rivers that flow into the North Sea.<ref> {{Citation

===Water circulation===
The main pattern to the flow of water in the North Sea is a counter-clockwise rotation along the edges.<ref>[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/water/marine/uk/policy/cleanerseas/cs03.htm Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK: Marine: Cleaner Seas report]</ref>  Water from the Gulf Stream flows in both through the English Channel towards Norway, and around the north of Britain, moving south along the British coast.  From the south-moving current smaller currents are pulled off eastwards into the central North Sea.  Another significant current sweeps south in the eastern part of the Sea.  This is cold North Atlantic water and is strongest in late spring and early summer when the British offshore waters remain cool while the sea off the Netherlands and Germany starts warming up.  Water from the Channel, and water flowing out of the Baltic Sea eventually move north along the Norwegian coast back into the Atlantic in what is called the Norwegian Current.<ref name="SaS"/> The current moves at a depth of some 50 to 100&nbsp;m (165-330&nbsp;ft).  It has a relatively low salinity due to the brackish water of the Baltic and the fresh water contributed by the rivers and the fjords. Though the current is, on average, cooler than the North Sea water as a whole, warmer water flowing in from the Channel mixed with the cooler waters of the Baltic and North Atlantic result in streams of widely varying temperatures within the current. 

The mean residence time of water in the North sea is between 1 and two years.<ref name="SaS">[http://www.safetyatsea.se/index.php?art=2041&group=400 Safety At Sea: Currents in the North Sea]</ref>  Water in the north is exchanged most quickly while water in the German Bight can flow in circles for years before being pulled northwards.
  
Fronts based on temperature, salinity, nutrients, and pollution can be clearly identified; they are more clearly defined in summer than in winter. Large fronts are the Frisian Front, which divides water coming from the North Atlantic from water originating in the English Channel, and the Danish Front, which divides southern coastal waters from water in the central North Sea. The inflow of water from large rivers mixes very slowly with North Sea water. Water from the Rhine and Elbe, for example, can still be clearly differentiated from sea water off the northwest coast of Denmark.

===Tides===
The tides are caused by the tide wave from the North Atlantic, as the North Sea itself is too small and too flat to have its own tides. Ebb and flow alternate in a cycle of 12.5 hours. The tide wave, owing to the Coriolis effect, flows around Scotland and then counter-clockwise along the English coast, reaching the German Bight some 12 hours after arriving in Scotland. In so doing, it runs around three amphidromic points: a central point lies shortly before the Straits of Dover. It is formed by the tide wave which is transported through the English Channel. It influences the tides in the narrow area in the Southern Bight between southern England and the Netherlands. The other amphidromic system consists of two points close to each other, which form a tide wave. The two other points just off the coast of southern Norway and lying on a line between southern Denmark and the West Frisian Islands form one single area around which the tides flow. Its central point lies off the coast of Denmark at 55° 25' N, 5° 15' E.<ref Name="Statistics1"/>

As a result, the tidal range in southern Norway is less than half a metre (1.5&nbsp;ft), but increases the further any given coast lies from the amphidromic point. Shallow coasts and the funnel effect of narrow straits increase the tidal range. The tidal range is at its greatest at The Wash on the English coast, where it reaches 6.80&nbsp;m (22&nbsp;ft). In shallow water areas, the real tidal range is strongly influenced by other factors, such as the position of the coast and the wind at any given moment or the action of storms. In river estuaries, high water levels can considerably amplify the effect of high tide.

==Coasts==
The western coasts of the North Sea are jagged, as they were stripped by Mer du Nord</ref>

===Northern fjords, skerries, and cliffs===

The northern North Sea coasts bear the impression of the enormous glaciers which covered them during the Ice Ages and created a split, craggy coastal landscape. Fjords arose by the action of glaciers, which dragged their way through them from the highlands, cutting and scraping deep trenches in the land. During the subsequent rise in sea level, they filled with water. They very often display steep coastlines and are extremely deep for the North Sea. Fjords are particularly common on the coast of Norway.<ref>{{Citation

Firths are similar to fjords, but are generally shallower with broader bays in which small islands may be found. The glaciers that formed them influenced the land over a wider area and scraped away larger areas. Firths are to be found mostly on the Scottish and northern English coasts. Individual islands in the firths, or islands and the coast, are often joined up by sandbars or spits made up of sand deposits known as “tombolos”.<ref>{{Citation

Towards the south the firths give way to a cliff coast, which was formed by the moraines of Ice Age glaciers.<ref>{{Citation
