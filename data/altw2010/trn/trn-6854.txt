Below a full report on all use of the link horsetalk.co.nz.

This list is intended to see how the external link gets used, it does '''not''' imply that involved accounts are having a conflict of interest in adding the link, or that the involved accounts are spamming the link.

The following is a list of notable '''deaths in 2007'''. Names are listed under the date of death, not the date it was announced. Names under each date are listed in alphabetical order by family name.

A typical entry appears in the following sequence:
* Name, age, country of citizenship and reason for notability, established cause of death, reference.

<!--
==============Please read before adding a name to this list==============
Only those meeting the Wikipedia notability guidelines are listed, with a reference to a reliable source.
* Causes of death such as "old age" and "natural causes" should not be cited unless stated in the reference.

The intent of these pages is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily make the deceased "notable". If you report the death of someone who does not already have a Wikipedia article, please consider starting one. -->
