300px|thumb|"Els tres grans": [[Josef Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt i Winston Churchill es troben a Teheran el 1943.]]El grup de països coneguts com '''aliats''' durant la Segona Guerra Mundial consistia en les nacions oposades a les Potències de l'Eix.

Inicialment, els principals països '''aliats''' eren: Gran Bretanya, França (França Lliure a partir del juny de 1940), Polònia, Canadà, Sud-Àfrica, Austràlia i Nova Zelanda. Un cas especial és la Xina que estava en guerra amb el Japó des del 1937. Com a conseqüència de la invasió alemanya, s'hi van afegir Noruega (abril de 1940), Països Baixos i Bèlgica (maig de 1940) i Grècia (octubre de 1940), que havia estat atacada per Itàlia. La Unió Soviètica tenia un pacte amb Alemanya des de l'agost de 1939 però la invasió alemanya, el juny de 1941, la va fer canviar de bàndol. El desembre de 1941 l'atac japonès a Pearl Harbor va fer que els Estats Units d'Amèrica entressin a la guerra en el bàndol aliat.

A mesura que el conflicte es decantava en contra d'Alemanya, el nombre de països en el bàndol aliat va anar augmentant. Prop del final de la guerra, els Aliats van posar com a condició per entrar a les Nacions Unides que els països declaressin la guerra a Alemanya i al Japó. Això va fer que el nombre de països aliats augmentés molt, encara que la majoria d'aquests mancaven de rellevància militar i estratègica i no van tenir cap paper actiu en la guerra.

==History==
===China===

When World War II began, China had been fighting the Empire of Japan since -1937.

During the 1920s, the Kuomintang (KMT) government led by  Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was aided by the Soviet Union, which helped to reorganise the party, superficially at least, along Leninist lines: a unification of party, state, and army. However, following the nominal unification of China in 1928, Chiang Kai-shek purged leftists from his party and fought against the Chinese Communist Party, former warlords, and other militarist factions. A fragmented China provided easy opportunities for Japan to gain territories piece by piece without engaging in total war. Following the 1931 Mukden Incident, the puppet state of Manchukuo was established. Throughout the early to mid 1930s, Chiang's anti-communist and anti-militarist campaigns continued while he fought small, incessant conflicts against Japan, usually followed by unfavorable settlements and concessions.

In the early 1930s, Germany and China became close partners in military and industrial matters. made peace with Japan to prepare for the war against Germany.

Even though China had been fighting the longest among all the Allied powers, it only officially joined the Allies after the attack on Pearl Harbor, on 7 December 1941. Chiang Kai-shek felt Allied victory was assured with the entrance of the United States into the war, and he declared war on Germany and the other Axis nations. However, Allied aid remained low because the Burma Road was closed and the Allies suffered a series of military defeats against Japan early on in the campaign. The bulk of military aid did not arrive until the spring of 1945. More than 1.5 million Japanese troops were trapped in the China Theatre; troops that otherwise could have been deployed elsewhere had China collapsed and made a separate peace with Japan.

===Key alliances are formed===
On the day  third of September. The British declaration also covered the Indian Empire and other states which were British Crown Colonies at the time.

Following the ''British Commonwealth had independence in foreign policy. Barry Hertzog, refused to declare war, leading to the collapse of his coalition government on 6 September; the new Prime Minister, Jan Smuts, declared war that same day. Canada declared war on Germany on 10 September; this was necessary as Canada had ratified the ''Statute of Westminster''.

On invaded Poland from the East, and on attacked Finland. The following year the USSR annexed the German invasion of the USSR on 22 June 1941.

The United States of America joined the Allies following the attack on Pearl Harbor, on 7 December 1941. The Declaration by United Nations, on 1 January 1942, officially united 26 nations as Allies. The informal ''Big 3'' alliance of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States emerged in the later half of the war, and their decisions determined Allied strategy around the world.

==Formal alliances during the war==
===Original Allies===
The original Allies were those states that declared war on Nazi Germany following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939.
<!--Please do not alter the names of political entities & nations cited here; they have all been properly researched and cited-->
* Second Polish Republic
* United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<ref>effectively the British Empire but excluding the Dominions.</ref>
* French Republic

These countries were allied to each other by a net of common defence pacts and military alliance pacts signed before the war. The Franco-British Alliance dated back to the Entente Cordiale of 1904 and the Triple Entente of 1907, active during the World War I. The Franco-Polish Alliance was signed in 1921 and then amended in 1927 and 1939. The Polish-British Common Defence Pact, signed on 25 August 1939, contained promises of mutual military assistance between the nations in the event either was attacked by Nazi Germany.

===Poland===

The Polish People's Army under Zygmunt Berling, around which it constructed the post-war successor state People's Republic of Poland. The Polish People's Army took part in the Battle of Berlin, the closing act of the European theater of war.

===British Commonwealth/British Empire===
The United Kingdom and territories controlled by the Crown Colonies) and the British Indian Empire<ref>including the areas covered by the later Republic of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh</ref> were controlled politically by Britain and therefore also entered hostilities with Britain's declaration of war.

Apart from these were the independent members of the British Commonwealth &mdash; the official name in 1926-49 &mdash; known as the Newfoundland had given up self-rule and was at the time under effective rule from the UK; it did not become part of Canada until 1949.

The British Indian Empire contributed about 2,500,000 personnel. It suffered 1,500,000 civilian casualties (more than the United Kingdom) 87,000 military casualties (more than any Commonwealth country but less than the United Kingdom).

===France===

France experienced several major phases of action during World War II:

* The "Phoney War" of 1939–1940, also called ''drôle de guerre'' in France, ''dziwna wojna'' in Poland (both meaning "Strange War"), or the ''"Sitzkrieg"'' ("Sitting War") in Germany.
* The Battle of France in May–June 1940, which resulted in the defeat of the French Army, the fall of the French Third Republic and the creation of the rump state Vichy France.
* The period of French Resistance and Free French Forces, from 1940–1944, until the June 1944 D-Day invasions part of the Battle of Normandy and the August 1944 invasion of southern France in Operation Dragoon, which led to the Liberation of Paris on 25 August 1944 and the liberation of France by the allies.
* The political creation of the First French Army, including the final drive on Germany, which culminated in V-E Day, on 7 May 1945.

===Oslo Group===
The Oslo Group was an organisation of officially neutral countries. Four members later joined the Allies, as Kingdom of Norway, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

The Republic of Finland was attacked by the USSR on Kingdom of Denmark officially joined the Axis Kingdom of Sweden remained officially neutral. Following the Moscow armistice of September 1944, Finland effectively joined the Allies and expelled German forces. This led to a series of armed clashes called the Lapland War.
