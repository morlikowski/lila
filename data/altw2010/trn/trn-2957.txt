'''Italy of Values''' (''Italia dei Valori'', IdV) is a populist<ref name="cnn_transcripts" /><ref name="ft" /><ref name="guardian" /><ref name="focusweb"></ref> and anti-corruption Italian political party, headed by former Mani Pulite magistrate Antonio Di Pietro. The party is a member of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR). 

==History==
Democratic Union. In The Olive Tree in a single "Democratic" party.

In the 1999 European Parliament election The Democrats scored 7.7% and Di Pietro was elected MEP. After having been organizational secretary and speaker in the Senate for the party, Di Pietro left it in April 2000 because of his opposition to the nomination of Giuliano Amato, a long-time member of the Italian Socialist Party (which was the principal subject of investigation of Di Pietro when magistrate) at the time close to the Democrats of the Left. Shortly afterwards Di Pietro set up again Italy of Values.

IdV founght the 2001 general election alone on a populist platform, comprising tough management of Chamber of Deputies and obtained no seats, while electing one Senator, Valerio Carrara, who soon left the party and switched to Forza Italia, Berlusconi's party.

In the 2004 European Parliamentary Elections he teamed up with one-time communist leader MEPs; Occhetto immediately renounced to his seat in favour of the communist journalist Giulietto Chiesa.

In early 2006 general elections, IdV, this time member of the winning centre-left The Union, scored 2.1% and Di Pietro was sworn in as Minister for Infrastructures in Prodi II Cabinet.

The party made major gains in the 2008 general election, but its coalition partners did not and they were out of government. IdV won 4.4% of the vote and got elected 29 deputies and 14 senators.

==Ideology==
While the party is currently member of the centre-left coalition, its members had been very diverse ideologically, ranging from the far-left (i.e. Communists and former ''Leghisti'', as well as former ''Missini'' and former Christian Democrats.
