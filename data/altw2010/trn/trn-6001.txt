Avant l'adoption expérimentale de l'hélice dans les années 1840, la seule technologie à vapeur disponible était l'utilisation de roue à aubes sur le coté du navire. Mais la disposition de l'artillerie sur les navires de l'époque nuisait à l'utilisation de cette technique.

''Dupuy de Lôme a conçu et réalisé le plan le plus audacieux pour concevoir un navire à roues en nœuds (26 km/h). Pendant la canons. Doté d'un design audacieux mais prudent, le Napoléon était issu de l'héritage de Jacques-Noël Sané alors que de l'apparition de nouvelles techniques (vapeur) laissait entrevoir de nouvelles évolutions.''

'''''Le Napoléon''''' was a 90-gun ship of the line of the French Navy, and the very first purpose-built steam battleship in the world <ref>"Napoleon (90 guns), the first purpose-designed screw line of battleships", ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', Conway's History of the Ship (p39)</ref>. She is also considered the first true steam battleship, and the first screw battleship ever <ref>''"Hastened to completion Le Napoleon was launched on 16 May 1850, to become the world's first true steam battleship"'', ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', Conway's History of the Ship (p39)</ref>. Launched in 1850, she was the lead ship of a class of 9 battleships, all considered as very successful and built over a period of 10 years. This class of ship was designed by the famous naval designer Dupuy de Lôme.<!---why are these quotes needed for a claim that isn't outlandish?--->

==Technological context==
Before the experimental adoption of the screw in warships in the 1840s, the only available steam technology was that of the paddle wheels, which, due to their positioning on the side of the hull and the large machinery they required were not compatible with the broadside cannon layout of the battleships.

:''"Dupuy de Lôme conceived and carried out the bolder scheme of designing a full-powered screw liner, and in 1847 ''Le Napoléon'' was ordered. Her success made the steam reconstruction of the fleets of the world a necessity. She was launched in 1850, tried in 1852, and attained a speed of nearly . During the Crimean War her performances attracted great attention, and the type she represented was largely increased in numbers. She was about . in length, . in breadth, and of 5,000&nbsp;tons displacement, with two gun decks. In her design boldness and prudence were well combined. The good qualities of the sailing line-of-battle ships which had been secured by the genius of Sané and his colleagues were maintained; while the new conditions involved in the introduction of steam power and large coal supply were thoroughly fulfilled."'' (Scientific American Supplement, No. 481, March 21, 1885)

==Developments by other navies==
From 1844–45 the Anglo-French Entente collapsed following the French interventions in Tahiti and Morocco, and the publication of French pamphlets advocating a stronger navy (such as "''Notes sur l’état des forces navales''" by the Prince de Joinville), leading to an arms race in the naval area.

The United Kingdom already had a few coastal units with screw/steam propulsion in the 1840s, called "blockships", which were conversions of small traditional battleships into floating batteries with a jury rig, with a medium  engine for speeds of  to . However, the ''Napoléon'' was the first regular steam battleship to be launched.

In 1846, Britain had designed a screw/steam battleship named the ''James Watt'', but the project was abandoned. Finally, the ''Agamemnon'' was ordered in 1849 and commissioned in 1853 as a response to rumours of the French development. Britain’s reluctance to commit to the steam battleship apparently stemmed from her commitment to long-distance, worldwide operation, for which, at that time, sail was still the most reliable mode of propulsion.
