'''Renee Olstead''' (born '''Rebecca Renee Olstead''',  American Still Standing'' as Lauren Miller, and several bit parts in various TV shows and movies. In addition, she has recorded five studio albums, primarily of jazz music.

==Early life==
Olstead was born in Kingwood, Texas, to Christopher Eric Olstead and Rebecca Lynn Jeffries. As a child actress, she made films and commercials from age eight onwards. 
From 2002 to 2006, she appeared in the TV Still Standing'' as middle sister Lauren Miller. She also had a small part in the 2004 film ''13 Going on 30''.

==Music career==
In 2004, Olstead released an eponymous album of jazz songs and pop standards for Warner Bros. Records to good reviews; since her previous releases had limited distribution, this album was considered her true debut. She subsequently performed in Berlin during the Live 8 concert on July 2, 2005. Additionally, she recorded with trumpeter Chris Botti on his 2005 album ''To Love Again: The Duets'' and appears on the 2006 DVD ''Chris Botti Live with Orchestra and Special Guests.'' Her singing style and talent has already been compared with such great jazz vocalists as Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan. Reportedly her musical talent was discovered by composer David Foster, who produced her 2004 album. She later also performed with Foster on the ''Oprah Winfrey Show''. 

A follow-up album entitled ''Skylark'', also produced by Foster, was originally announced for release in 2005, but it has subsequently been pushed back several times, with release dates in the summer of 2006 and early 2007 being mentioned on online retailers such as Amazon.com.  It was slated for a June 2008 release, but has not yet appeared<ref>[http://www.olografix.org/krees/dfnet2/?p=346 www.davidfoster.info » Video interview: David Foster on Tom Green’s House Tonight<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.
