Lim was also charged under Section 8A (1) of the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984 for 'maliciously printing' a pamphlet containing allegedly 'false information' because he had described the alleged rape victim as an 'imprisoned victim' because she was initially detained by Malaysian police without parental consent for 10 days.

After a series of appeals, Lim was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. He was, however, released after 12 months on 2004 Malaysian General Election. He is a candidate in the Bagan parliamentary seat as well as the Air Puteh state assembly setan in Penang in the 12th Malaysian General Election.
