'''Jay Noel Yuenger''' (born White Zombie.

==Early life==
Through his mother, a classical soprano and voice teacher, Yuenger was exposed to music early, played piano and sang in children's choirs. Growing up in the diverse Hyde Park neighborhood on Chicago's south side (one of the only truly integrated neighborhoods in the city, rich in culture and history and home to the University of Chicago), Yuenger was exposed to soul, jazz, folk, and the electric blues and attended the Kenwood Academy.  His father, a reporter for the ''Chicago Tribune'', was posted as bureau chief in several cities and Yuenger lived in Washington DC, Moscow, and London before he was 12 years old.

==Music career==
As a teenager, Yuenger's interests quickly progressed from pop to hard rock to hardcore punk.  He began learning guitar and played a small part in the early 1980s Chicago hardcore scene, forming the teen punk band Rights of the Accused in 1982.  They released the 7" EP, ''Innocence'', in 1983 and opened for several noteworthy groups including MDC, the Big Boys, Flipper, and Discharge.  Yuenger left the band in 1985, attended college, and by 1987 had moved to New York City.  After several failed attempts at forming groups in New York and New Jersey, he met the members of White Zombie in early 1989 and auditioned successfully to join the group as their guitar player.  The band released the previously recorded ''Make Them Die Slowly'' on Astro-Creep: 2000''.  They also contributed songs to various movie sountracks and compilation albums and ended up selling over 6 million records worldwide.  Since the official disbandment of White Zombie in 1997, Yuenger has lived in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York and has worked as a recording engineer and record producer.  In 2004, he recorded King Louie Bankston's King Louie One Man Band LP entitled Chinese Crawfish, which was released on Goner Records.  He currently lives in New Orleans and built a recording studio that opened in 2007.
