'''The Avenger''' is a Warner Brother's Paperback Library from 1973 to 1974. The Avenger was a pulp hero who combined elements of Doc Savage and The Shadow though he was never as popular as either of these characters.

The authorship of the pulp series was credited by Street and Smith to Paul Ernst.

==History==

The Avenger is actually Richard Henry Benson, a globe trotting adventurer who decided to settle down and raise a family. In his first adventure, Benson's plans for a peaceful life are shattered when his wife and young daughter are killed by a criminal conspiracy. The shock of this loss has a bizarre effect on Benson. His hair and the skin of his face turn white, and the flesh of his face became malleable, like clay. Towards the middle of the original series, the author was directed to eliminate Benson's facial affliction in the hopes of keeping the dwindling audience for the magazine. 

In #13, ''Murder On Wheels'', Cole Wilson was introduced. First an opponent of The Avenger before he joined his band in the same issue, Wilson trapped The Avenger in a machine which turned his flesh back to normal and his hair black. The Avenger still disguised himself after this but could not mold his now normal flesh as before. ''Nevlo'' (17), ''House of Death'' (15) and ''Death in Slow Motion'' (18) were all written before this and almost all references to the earlier condition of The Avenger were written out, though the odd one remains. Cole Wilson played a greater part in the last dozen books written by Ron Goulart.

Benson vows to avenge himself on the villains, and to fight for all those who have suffered at the hands of criminals.  His strange facial condition is actually an advantage for he can sculpt his face into a likeness of any person. With skin and hair dyes, and colored contact lenses, Benson becomes the world's greatest master of disguise, within limits.

Like miniature radios, and his special pistol "Mike" and throwing knife "Ike". Benson's trick was to shoot someone so that his bullet just touched their heads and knocked them out.

Benson also gathers a number of assistants to help him in his adventures. These are all people who have suffered loss because of criminals, and who have specialized skills:

* Fergus MacMurdie (known as "Mac") is a stereotypical Scotsman who is also a gifted pharmacist and chemist. His family was killed by racketeers, leaving Mac embittered and vengeful.
* Algernon Heathcote Smith (known as "Smitty") is a gigantic man of incredible strength. Smitty looks slow and stupid but he is actually a genius with electronics. He was framed for a crime he did not commit.
* Nellie Gray is a beautiful, delicate-looking young woman who is actually an expert at jujutsu and other martial arts. Her archaeologist father was killed by criminals for a treasure he had found.
* Josh and Rosabel Newton are an African American couple whose employers were killed by criminals. They often go undercover as domestic servants, making use of the stereotypes of the time to hide their investigative abilities. The Avenger series is notable its presentation of minorities. Many of the pulp magazines of the time are well known for racist stereotypes, but Josh and Rosabel are always presented as brave, intelligent people of good character.
* Cole Wilson joins the group near the middle of the series. He is much less distinctive than Benson's other assistants and has a light hearted manner that contrasts the Avenger's serious tone.

The original Avenger pulp novels were re-released as books by Warner Brothers Paperback Library in the 1970s. These were successful enough that new adventures were written by Ron Goulart. There have also been several attempts to revive the Avenger as a comic book character but these have not been very successful.

The Avenger is mentioned by author Philip José Farmer as a part of his Wold Newton family. In an essay found in ''Myths for the Modern Age: Philip José Farmer's Wold Newton Universe'' (Win Scott Eckert, ed., MonkeyBrain Books, 2005), author Chuck Loridans contributes an article entitled "The Daughters of Greystoke" wherein he constructs a family tree linking Nellie Gray to Tarzan and Jane Porter.

'''アヴェンジャー'''('''The Avenger''')は、1939年から1942年までストリート・アンド・スミス社(Street and Smith Publications)から出版されたパルプ誌「ジ・アヴェンジャー(The Avenger magazine)」誌に登場した架空のキャラクターである。

続編となる5編の短編が1942年から1943年の「クルーズ・ディテクティブ(Clues Detective magazine)」誌に、6番目となる中編が1943年の「ザ・シャドー(The Shadow magazine)」誌に発表された。この6編はオフィシャルなものと認定され、1973年から1974年のワーナー・ブラザーズ・ペーパーバック・ライブラリー(Warner Brother's Paperback Library)から出版された。
また、オリジナルの再版は1970年代のワーナー・ブラザーズ・ペーパーバック・ライブラリーで行われ、ロン・グーラート(Ron Goulart)による新作もあって、十分なセールスを記録した。

アヴェンジャーは、ドック・サヴェジとシャドーの要素を結合したパルプ・ヒーローであったが、両者ほど有名になることはなかった。

本シリーズの作者はケネス・ロブスンである。ケネス・ロブスンは、ストリート・アンド・スミス社がかかえる多くの作家たちによって用いられるハウスネームであり、ドック・サヴェジ・シリーズにも用いられている。アヴェンジャーものの大部分は、ポール・エルンスト(Paul Ernst)によって書かれている。

==キャラクター==
アヴェンジャーの本名は冒険家'''リチャード・ヘンリー・ベンソン'''(Richard Henry Benson)である。彼の妻と幼い娘が犯罪者の陰謀によって殺されたとき、ベンソンの人生は粉々に粉砕された。ベンソンは犯罪への復讐を誓い、犯罪者の手によって苦しめられた全ての被害者のためにあらゆる手段を用いて闘うことを決めた。

妻子を失ったショックは、ベンソンの肉体に奇怪な影響を及ぼした。彼の髪と皮膚は白くなり、彼の顔の筋肉は粘土の様に可塑性のあるものとなったのだ。これによって彼はいかなる人物の顔であっても真似られるようになった。皮膚と髪を染める染料と色つきのコンタクトレンズを用いることでベンソンは世界最高の変装の達人となった。

ベンソンは様々な特殊装備を用いて犯罪者たちと対決する。例えば、ノックアウトガス爆弾、ミニチュア・ラジオ、それに愛用の特殊拳銃「マイク(Mike)」とスローイングナイフ「アイク(Ike)」などである。

==仲間==
ベンソンには（他のパルプヒーローと同様に）、彼の冒険を助ける多くの仲間がいる。彼らもまた犯罪によって何かを失い、苦しめられた被害者であり、それぞれの持つ特技や技能をもって犯罪と戦おうとする人々である。
