'''Coolio''', americano, ficou conhecido pela canção "Gangsta's Paradise" tema do filme ''Dangerous Minds'', lançado no Brasil com o título ''Mentes Perigosas''.

== Biografia ==

Coolio passou a infância no bairro barra-pesada Compton, em Los Angeles, o mesmo que revelou o N.W.A., de onde saíram Ice Cube, Dr. Dre e Eazy-E, nomes de destaque do rap americano. Investindo num estilo leve e bem humorado, Coolio bebeu na mesma fonte que Dr. Dre, obtendo ainda mais sucesso: o Funkadelic de George Clinton. Entretanto, ao contrário da maioria dos rappers da época, optou por falar de festas em vez de tiroteios e violência. Após lançar pelo prestigiado selo Tommy Boy o EP ''County Line'', em 1993, estourou o hit "Fantastic Voyage", versão hip hop de uma música do grupo Lakeside (lançada originalmente em 1980). Depois, veio o álbum "''It Takes a Thief''" (1994), abusando de batidas ?pra cima? e renovando o rap, então limitado ao estilo gangsta de Dre e Snoop Dogg. A própria expressão chapada e as tranças estilo Medusa de Coolio colaboravam em favor do bom humor no clipe de "Fantastic Voyage". 

Contraditoriamente, foi o clima soturno e épico de "''Gangsta's Paradise''" que o projetou no mundo todo, superando a repercussão do hit anterior. A música, do álbum de mesmo nome lançado em novembro de 1995, foi construída sobre um sampler de Stevie Wonder ("Pastime Paradise") e permaneceu por várias semanas no Top Ten dos Estados Unidos. No entanto, Coolio não havia abandonado seu estilo despachado e hilário, como mostravam "1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New)" e "Too Hot", que tiveram participação na milionária vendagem de Gangsta's Paradise. O sucesso trouxe o artista ao Brasil, para shows em São Paulo e Rio de Janeiro em 1996. Lançado no ano seguinte, "''My Soul''" apresentava as batidas funk características de Coolio, porém com maior cuidado com a melodia. Apesar de não ter emplacado nenhum hit como seus antecessores, recebeu críticas positivas devido ao uso de violinos e guitarra, além de samplers obscuros. Em 2001 saiu a coletânea "''Fantastic Voyage: The Greatest Hits''", com a inédita "Aw Here It Goes".  

Em janeiro de 2004, Coolio tentou ganhar uma gravação no concurso da " Comeback Show " de uma televisão alemã, mas eventualmente o grupo Smokie ganhou isto em vez dele. Mesmo assim conseguiu participação em alguns seriados de tv.

Em setembro de 2005, ele assinou um contrato de registro mundial para três álbuns com Subside Records do produtor italiano Giovanni Giorgilli. Vanni G, como ele é melhor conhecido na cena eletrônica italiana, será o gerente e produtor do novo álbum de Coolio. A primeira colaboração é " Gangsta Walk" participação de Snoop Dogg. O álbum ''The Return of the Gangsta'' , lançado em 4 de agosto 2006. 
O álbum The Return of the Gangsta conta com várias participações especiais.
