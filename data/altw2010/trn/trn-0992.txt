Le '''temple de Saint-Sava''', en serbe cyrillique , se situe à Belgrade, la capitale de la Serbie, dans la municipalité de Vračar. L'église est consacrée à Saint Sava, fondateur de l'église orthodoxe serbe ; elle a été édifiée à l'endroit où, selon la tradition, Sinan Pasha a brûlé la dépouille de saint Sava en 1595.

Le temple de Saint-Sava est la plus grande église orthodoxe du monde mais elle est toujours en chantier. Sa construction a pourtant débuté en Yougoslavie. Le chantier n'a donc repris qu'en 2001. L'extérieur, d'architecture néo-byzantine, est maintenant terminé ; l'intérieur, lui, n'est que béton et échafaudages mais le temple est ouvert au public ;  personnes peuvent y entrer. L'intérieur sera entièrement recouvert de marbre blanc. La construction de l'église est exclusivement financée par des dons.

The '''Temple of Saint Sava''' (Serbian: Храм светог Саве or ''Hram svetog Save'') is the largest Orthodox church currently in use in medieval Serbia. It is built on the Vračar plateau, on the location where his remains are thought to have been burned in 1595 by the Ottoman Empire's Sinan Pasha. From its location, it dominates Belgrade's cityscape, and is perhaps the most monumental building in the city.  The building of the church structure is being financed exclusively by donations. The parish home is nearby, as will be the planned patriarchal building.

==Construction process==
Three hundred years after the burning of Saint Sava's remains, in 1895, the ''Society for the Construction of the Cathedral of Saint Sava on Vračar'' was founded in Belgrade. Its goal was to build a cathedral on the place of the burning. A small church was built at the future place of the Cathedral, and it was later moved so the construction of the Cathedral could begin. In 1905, a public contest was launched to design the church; all five applications received were rejected as not being good enough.

Soon, the breakout of the First World War stopped all activities on the construction of the church. After the war, in 1919, the Society was established again. New appeals for designs were made in 1926; this time, it received 22 submissions. Though the first and third prize were not awarded, the second-place project, made by architect Aleksandar Deroko, was chosen for the building of the Cathedral.

Forty years after the initial idea, construction of the church began in Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V).

The project was designed by Aleksandar Deroko and Bogdan Nestorovic, aided by civil engineer Vojislav Zadjina.

The work lasted until Axis occupation of foundation had been completed, and the 1941 bombing of Belgrade, work ceased altogether.

<!-- Deleted image removed: thumb|Bells -->The occupying German army used the unfinished church as a partisans and the Red Army used it with the same purpose. Later, it was used for storage by various companies. The Society for Building of the Cathedral ceased to exist and has not been revived.

In Patriarch Germanius renewed the idea of building the church. After 88 requests for continuation of the building&mdash;and as many refusals, permission for finishing the building was granted in 1984, and Branko Pešić was chosen as new architect of the church. He remade the original projects to make better use of new materials and building techniques.
