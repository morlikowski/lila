thumb|Wilma Rudolph, a fekete gazella
'''Wilma Glodean Rudolph''' (Clarksville, Tennessee, USA, olimpiák történetének egyik legemlékezetesebb alakja; a „fekete gazella”.

:''„Otthon 19-en voltunk gyerekek, s bizony rohanni kellett, hogy amikor asztalhoz érünk, találjunk legalább egy falatot!”''

Az első futónő volt, aki egyetlen olimpián három aranyérmet nyert (1960. Róma). Koraszülöttként, két kilogramm testsúllyal látta meg a napvilágot. Négy éves korában skarláttal és tüdőgyulladással került kórházba. Gyermekbénulás következtében az egyik lába megbénult. Édesanyja kitartásánk köszönhetően (hetente kétszer hordta egy, a feketék számára kijelölt, 50 mérföldre fekvő kórházba kezelésre) sikerült évek múlva lábra állnia. Tíz éves korában tanult meg újra járni. A száz és kétszáz méteres síkfutás mellett a váltóban is aranyérmet szerzett. 

Az iskolai években megtanult kosárlabdázni, és 18 éves korára állandó tagja volt az iskolai kosár- és atlétacsapatnak. Itt figyelt fel rá egy szakember, akinek javaslatára ösztöndíjat kapott a Tennessee Egyetemen.

1956-ban tagja volt a melbourne-i olimpia 4x400-as amerikai váltónak (bronzérem). Négy évvel később Rómában nemzeti hős lett. 

Visszavonulása után hazatért szülőhelyére, edző lett Clarksville-ben, a helyi iskolában. 1994. november 12-én halt meg agytumorban.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Wilma Rudolph was born on June 23,1940 in St. Bethlehem, a part of blacks 50 miles from their home, twice a week. Because of the expense and difficulty of obtaining professional medical care, Wilma's mother usually treated her ailing child at home. Rudolph remembered that during her youth, "my mother used to have all these home remedies she would make herself, and I lived on them". Many nights her mother, tired after a long day's work, would sit on Wilma's bed and massage her daughter's leg well into the evening hours. Blanche Rudolph kept telling her polio-stricken daughter she would one day walk without braces.<ref>Biracree, Tom. p. 32</ref>

===Athletic highlights===
In 1952, 12-year old Wilma Rudolph finally achieved her dream of shedding her handicap and becoming like other children. Wilma's older sister was on a Tennessee State track and field coach Edward S. Temple. Being discovered by Temple was a major break for a young athlete. The day he saw the tenth grader Wilma Rudolph for the first time, he knew he had found a natural athlete. Wilma had already gained some track experience on Burt High School's track team two years before, mostly as a way to keep busy between basketball seasons.<ref>Biracree, Tom. p. 47</ref>

While attending Burt High School, Rudolph became a basketball star, setting state records for scoring and leading her team to the state championship. 
By the time she was 16, she earned a berth on the U.S. Olympic track and field team and came home from the 1956 Melbourne Games with an Olympic bronze medal in the 4 x 100-meter relay. 

At the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome she won three Olympic titles; the 100 m, 200 m and the 4 x 100 m relay. The temperature climbed toward 100 degrees, 80,000 spectators jammed the ''Stadio Olimpico''. Rudolph ran the 100-meter dash in an impressive 11 seconds flat. She also won the 200-meter dash in 23.2 seconds, a new Olympic record. After these twin triumphs, she was being hailed throughout the world as "the fastest woman in history." Finally, on September 11, 1960, she combined with Tennessee State teammates Martha Hudson, Lucinda Williams and Barbara Jones to win the 400-meter relay in 44.5 seconds, setting a world record. Rudolph had a special, personal reason to hope for victory--to pay tribute to Jesse Owens, the celebrated American athlete who had been her inspiration, also the star of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin, Germany.<ref>Biracree, Tom. p. 16</ref> 

Rudolph retired from track competition in 1962 after winning two races at a U.S.-Soviet meet.

===Career and family===

In 1963, Rudolph was granted a full scholarship to Tennessee State University where she ultimately received her bachelor's degree in elementary education. After her athletic career, Rudolph worked as a teacher at Cobb Elementary School, coaching track at Burt High School, and as a sports commentator on national television. 

Wilma married her high school sweetheart Robert Eldridge in 1963, and had four children: Yolanda (b. 1958), Djuanna (b. 1964), Robert Jr. (b. 1965) and Xurry (b. 1971). Wilma and Eldridge later divorced.

===Enduring fame===

In 1977, Rudolph published her autobiography, ''Wilma: The Story of Wilma Rudolph''. That same year, NBC made a movie about her life from the book, with Rudolph as a consultant. The actor Denzel Washington, then 22 years old, portrayed Wilma's boyfriend, and he later married Pauletta Pearson whom he met on the set.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076923/ NBC "Wilma"]</ref>
