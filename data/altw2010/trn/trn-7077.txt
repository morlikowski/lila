Le '''Triborough Bridge''' (littéralement “Pont tri-borough”) est un complexe composé de trois ponts qui relient les trois borough de Manhattan, du Queens et du Bronx à New York. Le Triborough traverse deux îles, Ward's Island puis Randall's Island du sud au nord, qui servent d'intermédiaires au dessus de l'eau entre les trois grands districts. Les trois ponts enjambent le Hell Gate, Harlem River, et le détroit du Bronx Kill. Le complexe et géré par la ''Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority'', une filiale de la Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Les trois ponts qui composent le Triborough Bridge sont de structures et de longueurs différentes: le plus long est le ''East River suspension bridge'', pont suspendu long de 847 mètres, suivi du ''Bronx Kills crossing'' long de 488 mètres; le troisième est le ''Harlem River lift bridge'' qui est un pont levant.

La construction du complexe débuta en Maine et le Mississipi, alors que la fabrication des caissons dans lesquels le béton fut coulé nécessita l'abattage de toute une forêt dans l'Oregon.

Après les attentats du 11 septembre 2001, les autorités ont interdit de prendre des photographies ou des vidéos de la structure, de peur que des groupes terroristes puissent les étudier afin de préparer un nouvel attentat contre la ville.

The '''Triborough Bridge''' is a complex of three boroughs of rights-of-way between the water crossings.  These two islands have been consolidated by landfill.

The bridges span the Hell Gate (a tidal channel of the East River), Harlem River, and Bronx Kill. 

==History==
Plans for connecting Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx were first announced by Edward A. Byrne, chief engineer of the New York City Department of Plant and Structures, in 1916. While its construction had been long recommended by local officials, the Triborough Bridge did not receive any funding until 1925, when the city appropriated funds for surveys, test borings and structural plans.

Construction had begun on Othmar Ammann's assistance was enlisted to help simplify the structure. Ammann had collapsed the original two-deck roadway into one, requiring lighter towers, and thus, lighter piers. These cost-saving revisions saved $10 million on the towers alone. Using New Deal money, the project was resurrected in the early 1930s by Robert Moses and the bridge was opened to traffic on July 11, 1936. Its cost was greater than that of the Hoover Dam.

The structure used concrete from factories from Maine to Mississippi.  To make the casings for pouring the concrete a whole forest in Oregon was cut down.<ref name=Caro>Robert Caro, The Power Broker, Vintage, 1974.</ref>

The bridge is owned by the City of New York and operated by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA), an affiliate agency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York).

At some point in the past, a sign on the bridge informed travelers, "In event of attack, drive off bridge", ''New York Times'' columnist William Safire wrote in 2008. The "somewhat macabre sign", he wrote, must have "drawn a wry smile from millions of motorists."<ref>Safire, William, "A blind alley for No Exit", Safire's "On Language" column, ''The New York Times Magazine'', July 13, 2008</ref>

On June 4, 2008, on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy the New York State Assembly voted to rename the bridge in honor of the former New York Senator.
