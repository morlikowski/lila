Atlético Marte came to life on April 22, 1950, when the Alacranes, which was managed by some of the military, were given promotion to the Primera División de Fútbol Profesional.
Atlético Marte arrival in the first division coincided with the disappearance of Libertad F.C., both players and staff were absorbed into Atlético Marte as a sign of respect.

In other words, three consecutive years of being champions. 

After ten years of drought in terms of titles, but always with the label of a prestigious and dangerous team, the Martian returned to the glory of winning successive championships in 1969-70 and 1970-71.  It was the fourth and fifth titles respectively in its history.
