'''Ultimate''' är en lagsport som spelas med frisbee både inomhus och utomhus. Inomhus spelas matcherna med fem spelare på plan i varje lag och utomhus med sju. Mål gör man genom att fånga frisbeen inom de målzoner som finns på kortsidorna. När man håller i frisbeen får man endast rotera runt en roteringsfot som i basket och passa vidare till en annan spelare. Många tror att ultimate frisbee är en långsam sport eftersom spelaren som håller i frisbeen inte får springa. Faktum är att frisbee är en väldigt snabb sport där explosivitet, spänst och uthållighet är viktiga egenskaper för att bli en duktig frisbeespelare.

Ultimate är en sport utan domare som bygger på fair play. Det är spelarna själva som agerar som domare. Reglerna är många för att undvika att spelare inte kommer överens. De mest väsentliga reglerna är att när du håller i frisbeen får du endast rotera. Frisbeen får inte ryckas ur händerna på någon och tacklingar är inte tillåtna på den som har frisbeen.

Sporten är som störst i USA och Kanada. I Europa är den tämligen utspridd och i Sverige finns flera bra lag. De svenska utomhusmästerskapen har på herrsidan de senaste åren dominerats av Skogshyddans FK (Göteborg), Carnegie USC (Göteborg), KFUM Örebro och Viksjöfors IF. Skogshyddan vann även klubblags-EM 2001 i Prag, Tjeckien.
Ragings Seagulls DC (Göteborg) vann Junior-SM inomhus 2007 och KFUM Linköping utomhus.

I landslagssammanhang ligger Sverige i topp fem både på herr- och damsidan. VM anordnas vart fjärde år och anordnades senast i augusti 2004 i Åbo, Finland. Ultimate är en av de sporter som gärna vill bli en av OS-sporterna. För detta krävs dock att sporten blir mer utbredd i Asien, Afrika och Sydamerika.

Ultimate anser sig vara en lämplig sport för OS eftersom den bygger på fair play, något som många anser att OS saknat under de senaste åren. Dessutom är ultimate en väldigt publikvänlig sport med många mål och snabbt spel.

'''Ultimate''' (often called '''Ultimate Frisbee''' in reference to the trademarked brand name) is a non-contact rugby. Players may not run while holding the disc. Ultimate is distinguished by its spirit of the game&mdash;the principles of fair play, sportsmanship, and the joy of play.

While originally called "Ultimate Frisbee," the sport is often simply called "Ultimate."  This is because "Frisbee" is the trademark for the line of discs made by the Wham-O toy company. In fact, discs made by Wham-O competitor Discraft are the standard discs for the sport.  For this reason, the sport has also been called "Ultimate Disc" by many teams and clubs.  Today, the sport is simply known as "Ultimate."

==History==

=== Origin ===
Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey, were an eclectic group of students including leaders in academics, student politics, the student newspaper, and school dramatic productions. One member of the original team was Walter Sabo, who went on to be a major figure in the American radio business.  The sport became identified as a counterculture activity. The first definitive history of the sport was published in December 2005, ''ULTIMATE: The First Four Decades''.<ref name="LeonardoZagoria"></ref>

While the rules governing movement and scoring of the disc have not changed, the early Columbia High School games had sidelines that were defined by the parking lot of the school and team sizes based on the number of players that showed up. Gentlemanly behavior and gracefulness were held high. (A foul was defined as contact "sufficient to arouse the ire of the player fouled.") No referees were present, which still holds true today: all ultimate matches (even at high level events) are self-officiated. At higher levels of play 'observers' are often present. Observers only make calls when appealed to by one of the teams, at which point the result is binding.<ref></ref>

=== Collegiate clubs ===
The first collegiate ultimate club was formed by Silver when he arrived at Lafayette College in 1970.<ref></ref>

The first intercollegiate competition was held at Rutgers' New Brunswick campus between Rutgers and Princeton on first intercollegiate game of American football featuring the same schools competing in the same location.

By 1975, dozens of colleges had teams, and in April 1975, players organized the first ultimate tournament, an eight-team invitational called the "Intercollegiate Ultimate Frisbee Championships," to be played at Yale. Rutgers beat Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 26-23, in the finals.

By 1976, teams were organizing in areas outside the Northeast. A 16-team single elimination tournament was set up at Midwest teams. Rutgers again took the title, beating Santa Barbara area.

Penn State hosted the first five-region National Ultimate Championships in May 1979. There were five regional representatives: three college and two club teams. They were as follows: Glassboro State- (Middle Atlantic), Michigan State-(Central), Orlando Fling-(South), Santa Barbara Condors-(West). Each team played the other in a round robin format to produce a Glassboro-Condors final. The Condors had gone undefeated up to this point; however Glassboro prevailed 19-18 to become the 1979 national champions. They repeated as champions in 1980 as well.

=== Club and international play ===
In California clubs were sprouting in the Los Angeles - Santa Barbara area, while in the east, where the sport developed at the high school and college level, the first college graduates were beginning to found club teams, such as the Philadelphia Frisbee Club, the Washington Area Frisbee Club, the Knights of Nee in New Jersey, the Hostages in Boston and so forth.  Arkansas also has a few formidable teams located in the towns of Pocahontas, Newport, and Batesville. 

In the same year, ultimate arrived in the United Kingdom, with the UK's first clubs forming at the University of Warwick and the University of Cambridge, and Purley high school<ref name="LeonardoZagoria"></ref>, by the late 1970s and early 1980s there were also clubs at the University of Southampton, University of Leicester, and University of Bradford.

=== Players associations ===
In 1979 and 1980 the Ultimate Players Association (UPA) was formed. The UPA organized regional tournaments and has crowned a national champion every year since 1979. 

The popularity of the sport quickly spread, taking hold as a free-spirited alternative to traditional organized sports. In recent years college ultimate has attracted a greater number of traditional athletes, raising the level of competition and athleticism and providing a challenge to its laid back, free-spirited roots.

In 1981 the European Flying Disc Federation (EFDF) was formed.<ref>[http://www.wfdf.org/index.php?page=history/timeline.htm WFDF :: Flying Disc History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
In 1984 the World Flying Disc Federation was formed by the EFDF to be the international governing body for disc sports.<ref>[http://www.wfdf.org/index.php?page=history/timeline.htm WFDF :: Flying Disc History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Founded in 1986, incorporated in 1993 the Ottawa-Carleton Ultimate Association based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, has the largest summer league in the world with 354 teams and over 5000 players as of 2004.<ref>[http://www.ocua.ca/node/13 OCUA]</ref>

In 2006 ultimate became a BUCS accredited sport at UK universities for both indoor and outdoor open division events.

==Rules of play==
There are two sets of nearly identical rules in common use: the [http://www4.upa.org/ultimate/rules/11th_links Ultimate Players Association rules] used in North America and the [http://www.wfdf.org/index.php?page=rules/index.htm World Flying Disc Federation rules] used in all other parts of the world. The two rule sets are mostly the same with some minor differences. This section provides an overview of the rules that are common between both sets.

===Objective===
The objective of ultimate is to score points by receiving a teammate's pass in the opponent's end zone. The outcome of a match is usually determined by one team achieving a predetermined number of points first. This ensures that a team can only win by scoring, rather than by running the clock down.

===Teams===
Regulation ultimate is played between two teams of seven players.  In informal "pick-up" games, the number of players varies.  Substitutions are allowed between points, and teams are usually able to have around 20 players on their roster in a major tournament.  A shortage of players may force teams to play the entire game without substitutions, a condition known as ''savage''.

===Equipment===
The sport is played using a 175 gram disc; for some national and international tournaments, only discs that have been approved by the governing body responsible for that tournament may be used.

===Shoes===
Soccer as well as football cleats are often worn.  While soccer cleats are used more commonly, football cleats are preferred by some for their arch support, ankle support, and extra padding. Ultimate-specific cleats are produced by ultimate equipment manufacturer and retailer ''Gaia'', although only a minority of players wear their footwear.

===Bounds===
400px|thumb|right|The UPA outdoor ultimate field
Regulation games are played on a field of 70 yards (64 meters) by 40 yards (37 meters).  Under UPA rules, endzones are 25 yards (23 meters) deep, while under WFDF rules, endzones are 19.5 yards (18 metres) deep.  Normally, ultimate is played outdoors on grass.  Boundaries are marked by chalklines and cones.

===Gameplay===
====Pull or throw-off====

The players line up at the edge of their respective endzones, and the defensive team throws, or '''pulls''', the disc to the offensive team to begin play. Pulls are the first throws in a game. Pulls are normally long, hanging throws, giving the defense an opportunity to move up the field.

The pull is often started by a member of the defending team raising one arm with the disc to show that they are ready to pull the disc and begin play. The team that pulls to start the game is usually decided in a manner similar to a coin toss.  One popular way to decide which team pulls involves a player from both teams flipping a disc into the air while a third player calls "same" or "different" depending on how the discs land. If the player guesses correctly, his/her team gets to decide if they want to start on offense or defense or choose a side that they wish to start on.

====Movement of the disc====
The disc may be moved in any direction by completing a pass to a teammate. After catching a pass, a player is required to come to a stop as quickly as possible, and then can only move their non-pivot foot. A common misconception is that a player must setup a pivot foot before they can throw the disc. In fact, the player can throw the disc before stopping within the first couple of steps after they gain possession of the disc. It is this fact that makes the "Greatest" rule possible. A "Greatest" occurs when a player jumps from within bounds to catch a disc that has passed out-of-bounds, this is also known as an "ultimate play". The player must then throw the disc back in-bounds before his feet or any other part of his body touches the ground. The thrower may only catch their own throw if another player touches it in the air.

Upon receiving the disc, a player has ten seconds to pass it.  This period is known as the "stall", and each second is counted out (a ''stall count'') by a defender (the ''marker''), who must be standing within three meters of the thrower. A player may keep the disc for longer than ten seconds if no marker is within three meters, or if the marker is not counting the stall; if there is a change of marker, the new marker must restart the stall from zero.

====Scoring====
A point is scored when a player catches a pass in the endzone his team is attacking. In older versions of the rules, only offensive players could score. However, current UPA and WFDF rules allow a defensive team to score by intercepting a pass in the endzone they are defending. This play is referred to as a ''Callahan goal'' or simply a ''Callahan.'' It is named after well-known ultimate player Henry Callahan. 

After a point is scored, the teams exchange ends. The team who just scored remains in that end zone, and the opposing team takes the opposite end zone.  This can be commonly referred to in the phrase: "Losers walk." Play is re-initiated with a pull by the scoring team.

====Change of possession====
An incomplete pass results in a change of possession. When this happens the defense immediately becomes the offense and gains possession of the disc where it comes to a stop on the field of play, or where it first traveled out of bounds. Play does not stop because of a turnover.

Reasons for turnovers:
*Throw-away &mdash; the thrower misses his target and the disc falls to the ground.
*Drop &mdash; the receiver is not able to catch the disc.
*Block &mdash; a defender deflects the disc in mid flight, causing it to hit the ground.
*Interception &mdash; a defender catches a disc thrown by the offense.
*Out of bounds &mdash; the disc lands out of bounds, hits an object out of bounds or is caught by a player who lands out of bounds or leaps from outside the playing field.
*Stall &mdash; a player on offense does not release the disc before the defender has counted out ten seconds.

====Stoppage of play====
Play may stop for the following reasons:thumb|300px|right|A player gets fouled by an opponent.

=====Fouls=====
A foul is the result of contact between players, although incidental contact (not affecting the play) does not constitute a foul.  When a foul disrupts possession, the play resumes as if the possession were retained. If the player committing the foul disagrees with ("contests") the foul call, the disc is returned to the last thrower.

=====Violations=====
A violation occurs when a player violates the rules but does not initiate physical contact.  Common violations include traveling with the disc, double teaming, and picking (moving in a manner so as to obstruct the movement of any player on the defensive team).

=====Time outs and half-time=====
By Eleventh Edition rules, each team is allowed two time outs per half. The halftime break occurs when one team reaches the half-way marker in the score. Since most games are played to odd numbers, the number for half-time is rounded up. For instance, if the game is to 13, half comes when one team scores 7. A break may also occur if an injury occurs.

=====Injuries=====
Play stops whenever a player is injured&mdash;this is considered an injury time-out. During the duration, it is customary for players on the field to kneel or sit to ensure that they stay in their original positions. The injured person must then leave the field, and a substitute may come in.  If an injured player is substituted for, the opposing team may also substitute a player.

=====Weather=====
While Ultimate may be played in a myriad of weather conditions including heavy rain and deep snow, nearby lightning should result in stoppage of play with players seeking shelter.

====Substitutions====
Teams are allowed to substitute players after a point is scored or for injured player after an injury time out.  In the case of an injury substitution, the opposing team is allowed to make a substitution for a non-injured player.

====Refereeing====
Players are responsible for foul and line calls. Players resolve their own disputes. This creates a spirit of honesty and respect on the playing field. It is the duty of the player who committed the foul to speak up and admit his infraction.  Occasionally, official observers are used to aid players in refereeing, known as observers.

=====Observers=====
Some additional rules have been introduced in the United States and Canada which can optionally overlay the standard rules and allow for referees called ''observers''. An observer can only resolve a dispute if the players involved ask for his judgment. Although in some cases, observers have the power to make calls without being asked:  such as line calls (to determine out of bounds or goals) and off-sides calls (players crossing their end zone line before the pull is released). Misconduct fouls can also be given by an observer for violations such as aggressive taunting, fighting, cheating, etc., and are reminiscent of the Yellow/Red card system in football; however, misconduct fouls are rare, and their ramifications not well defined. Observers are also charged with enforcing time limits for the game itself and many parts within the game, such as the amount of time defense has to set up after a time out or the time allowed between pulls, are honored. 

The introduction of observers is, in part, an attempt by the UPA to allow games to run more smoothly and become more spectator-friendly. Because of the nature of play and the unique nature of self-refereeing, ultimate games are often subject to regular and long stoppages of play. This effort and the intensity that has arisen in the highest levels of competition have led many members of the ultimate community to lament the loss of the Spirit of the Game.

====Indoor and beach ultimate====
=====Indoor ultimate=====
Ultimate is sometimes played on an indoor football field, or the like. If the field has indoor football markings on it, then the outer most goal box lines are used for endzone lines.  Playing off the walls or ceiling is usually not permitted. Since indoor venues tend to be smaller, the number of players per side is often decreased. Depending of the size of the field, two types of game can be played : 4 on 4 or 5 on 5.

In some indoor leagues play '''Speedpoint''', also known as '''Quebec City rules (4 on 4)''', in order to speed up play:
*Only 2 pulls every game: at the beginning of the game and after halftime. Each team pulls once. 
*After a point is scored, play resumes from the point in the end zone where the point was scored.
*Maximum 20 second delay between the scoring of a point and the beginning of the next one.
*Players may only substitute between points.
*Each team is allowed one timeout per game.
*Timeouts cannot be called in the last 5 minutes of the game.
*In 5 on 5, substitution are allowed on the fly (while playing)

Indoor ultimate is played widely in Northern Europe during the winter because of frigid weather conditions.
In North America, indoor ultimate tends to be played in venues that can accommodate a field of regular or near-regular size and the playing surface is AstroTurf or some other kind of artificial grass.
In Europe, on the other hand, such facilities are rarely available, and indoor ultimate is usually on a handball or basketball court. In northern European and Scandinavian countries handball courts are the norm, whereas in the UK, Russia, and Southern Europe, basketball courts are more commonly used. Players often wear protection such as knee, elbow and wrist pads, much like in volleyball to avoid bruises and cuts when laying out.

European indoor ultimate has evolved as a variant of standard outdoor ultimate. Because of the small size of the court and of the absence of wind, several indoor-specific offensive and defensive tactics have been developed. Moreover, throws such as scoobers, blades, hammers, and push-passes are rarely used or discouraged outdoors because even a little wind makes them inaccurate or because they are effective only at short range, but they are common in the small and wind-free indoor courts.  The stall count is reduced to 8 seconds because of the faster nature of the indoor game.

There are regular indoor tournaments and championships and stable indoor teams. The best-known and longest-running indoor tournament is the Skogshyddan's Vintertrofén held in Gothenburg, Sweden, every year.

=====Beach ultimate=====
thumb|300px|right|Beach Ultimate
Beach ultimate is a variant of this activity. It is played in teams of four or five players on small fields.  It is played on sand and, as the name implies, normally at the beach. Players are barefoot. The Beach Ultimate Lovers Association (BULA) is the international governing body for Beach Ultimate. 

Most beach ultimate tournaments are played according to BULA rules, which are based on WFDF rules with a few modifications.

==Strategy and tactics==
===Offensive strategies===

thumb|200px|left|[[Information graphic showing the standard configuration for a vertical stack (offense and force/one-to-one defense).]]

Teams employ many different offensive strategies with different goals. Most basic strategies are an attempt to create open lanes on the field for the exchange of the disc between the thrower and the receiver. Organized teams assign positions to the players based on their specific strengths. Designated throwers are called ''handlers'' and designated receivers are called ''cutters.'' The amount of autonomy or overlap between these positions depends on the make-up of the team.

One of the most common offensive strategies is the '''vertical stack'''. In this strategy, the offense lines up in a straight line along the length of the field. From this position, players in the stack make cuts (sudden sprints out of the stack) towards or away from the handler in an attempt to get open and receive the disc. The stack generally lines up in the middle of the field, thereby opening up two lanes along the sidelines for cuts, although a captain may occasionally call for the stack to line up closer to one sideline, leaving open just one larger cutting lane on the other side.

Another popular offensive strategy is the '''horizontal stack.''' In the most popular form of this offense, three handlers line up across the width of the field with four cutters upfield, also lined up across the field. It is the handler's job to throw the disc upfield to the cutters. If no upfield options are available, the handlers swing the disc side to side in an attempt to reset the stall count while also getting the defense out of position.

Many advanced teams develop specific offenses that are variations on the basics in order to take advantage of the strengths of specific players. Frequently, these offenses are meant to isolate a few key players in one-on-one situations, allowing them more freedom of movement and the ability to make most of the plays, while the others play a supporting role.
