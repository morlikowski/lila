The '''New Wave of British Heavy Metal''' (frequently abbreviated as '''NWOBHM''' or '''N.W.O.B.H.M.''') is a heavy metal music movement that started in the late 1970s, in the heavy metal bands such as Diamond Head and Motörhead as a major influence on their musical style.<ref name=AMG/> 

==Characteristics==
NWOBHM's music reacted against the artifice of contemporary pop, placing an emphasis on musicianship and amplification, the former trait setting it apart from punk rock. Yet, unlike progressive rock, which placed a far greater emphasis on musical complexity, and unlike post-punk, which emphasized 'strangeness' and innovation, the NWOBHM thrived on volume, speed, and directness, with an idealised working class image.  

Reviled or ignored by many mainstream critics in both the UK and the US, the NWOBHM nonetheless came to dominate the hard rock scene of the early-mid 1980s. NWOBHM was musically characterised by power chords, fast guitar solos and melodic, soaring vocals, with lyrical themes often drawing inspiration from mythology, fantasy fiction, and the occult. The movement's music was, however, often surprisingly melodic, and surprisingly parallel to punk and post-punk.

==History==
===Performers===

The early movement was associated with acts such as: Saxon, Blitzkrieg, Avenger, Jaguar, Demon, Diamond Head, Samson and Tank, among others. The image of bands such as  Saxon (long hair, denim jackets, leather and chains) would later become synonymous with Venom and Quartz. 

Looking at most comprehensive lists of bands of the time reveals hundreds of obscure or short lived acts. While the average listener would possibly gloss over these unknowns looking for more recognisable acts, record collectors revere such bands. The sheer number of low cost demos from the era, as well as the limited amount of information and media coverage of the era, has led to some of the releases becoming highly collectable. Records originally pressed for very little cost have sold more recently to collectors for hundreds of dollars. In some cases as low as 1 copy of a record is known to exist.

===Decline===
NWOBHM suffered the same fate as many other musical movements. First, the majority of its leading lights were unable to follow up on their initial successes. Second, many bands moved further away from the era towards mainstream hard rock, with Def Leppard in particular targeting the American market with a more refined sound despite having major success. By the mid 1980s, young rock fans searching for their own identities found a new metal scene emanating from Los Angeles led by bands such as Mötley Crüe and later Guns N' Roses. Record companies also latched onto the L.A. scene over the NWOBHM scene because the L.A. bands brought them the one thing heavy metal hadn't yet brought into the fold - legions of female fans. Glam metal simply proved to be more profitable for record companies during this era. In addition, thrash metal, another new but much less mainstream metal scene, had fully emerged around the same time period, which attracted many rock fans for being much faster and even heavier than NWOBHM and often having political lyrics, though the entire genre itself was largely influenced by it.

Some of the more popular bands of the movement, however, went on to considerable, lasting success. Def Leppard, despite discarding their earlier, heavier sound, became even more successful when they used MTV to play their promotional music videos, and thus commercialising their hard rock sound in order to help sales of their albums on strengths of singles. Iron Maiden and Motörhead however stayed with a more traditional heavy metal style, which won them a large and loyal fanbase even after bands with a similar sound had declined.

===Subsequent influence===
Groups such as Venom, and Saxon, as well as many lesser-known ones, became part of the canon that influenced American bands that formed in the early eighties, such as Diamond Head, Motörhead and Blitzkrieg, the songs of each of which have been covered by Metallica.) 

In 1990 Lars Ulrich of Metallica compiled a double CD compilation album, entitled ''New Wave Of British Heavy Metal '79 Revisited'', featuring bands as obscure as Hollow Ground right through to the 'Supergroups' of the era.

===Revival===
The widespread popularity of the internet in the late 1990s/early 2000s helped NWOBHM fans to communicate again and NWOBHM experienced a minor revival. Encouraged by the success of tribute bands and nostalgia acts, many of the original NWOBHM bands reformed for successful tours and the revival was championed by ''Classic Rock'' magazine, a new publication featuring many of the original NWOBHM writers of the 1980s including Geoff Barton.

==Media support==
The NWOBHM existed mostly outside the world of the mainstream pop and rock culture. Magazines such as The NME (primarily focused on punk / new wave), The Face (primarily focused on new romantic / synth pop) and Sounds to pick up the NWOBHM baton. Young writer Geoff “Deaf” Barton began writing features on the new up and coming metal bands and Sounds even featured a weekly Heavy Metal chart compiled from record requests at “The Soundhouse”, a heavy metal soundhouse in North West London and the spiritual home of the movement.  

As the movement continued to thrive, Barton set up heavy metal. 

Tommy Vance was one of the few mainstream DJs to play NWOBHM on his ''Friday Rock Show'' on BBC Radio 1.

Die '''New Wave of British Heavy Metal''' (NWoBHM) ist ein Terminus aus den späten 1970er und frühen 1980er Jahren, den der Londoner Heavy-Metal-DJ Neal Kay erfand und damit einer musikalischen Sparte ihren Namen gab. Er wollte den jungen britischen Bands, die aus ihrer Liebe zu den frühen Heavy-Metal-Bands wie Black Sabbath, Judas Priest oder Deep Purple keinen Hehl machten, aber trotzdem die Energie des Punk schätzten, einen gemeinsamen Nenner geben.

Die klassischen Vertreter der NWoBHM sind u.&nbsp;a. Samson, Holocaust oder Diamond Head, aber auch noch heute erfolgreiche Bands wie Saxon. Black Sabbath, Judas Priest und Motörhead werden zwar nicht zur NWoBHM im engeren Sinne gezählt, da sie schon seit den frühen bzw. mittleren 70ern aktiv waren, jedoch waren diese Bands 1980 mit wichtigen Alben ebenfalls maßgeblich am Aufschwung der britischen Metal-Szene beteiligt bzw. profitierten selbst davon.

Obwohl die NWoBHM sich eigentlich ausschließlich auf britische Bands bezog, wurde die Botschaft schnell in ganz Europa und in Amerika verstanden: Auf der ganzen Welt gründeten sich viele junge Heavy-Metal-Bands und konnten von den Massenmedien immer schlechter übersehen werden. 

Die Musik der ursprünglichen NWoBHM wird heutzutage allgemein als ''Heavy Metal'' bezeichnet, als Abgrenzung zu Untersparten wie z.Bsp. Thrash Metal, Glam Metal, Speed Metal oder Power Metal.
