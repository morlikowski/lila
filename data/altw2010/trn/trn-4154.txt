 is a Key, who also produced the successful titles ''Air''. Key announced in 2001 a release date of 2002 for ''Clannad'' and, after several postponements, finally released a limited version for the PC on ported to the Irish.<ref name="pre-Clannad"></ref>

While both of Key's first two previous works, ''Air'', had been released first as adult games and then censored for the younger market like most Tomoyo Sakagami, one of the five heroines from ''Clannad''.

''Clannad'' has made several transitions to other media: four manga series, the first serialized in the Japanese magazine ''Comic Rush'', the second serialized in ''Comi Digi +'', the third serialized in ''Dengeki G's Magazine'', and the fourth in ''Dragon Age Pure''; an animated movie by the animation studio Toei Animation released on September 15 2007; two anime series by Kyoto Animation, which also animated the previous Key titles ''Air'' and ''Kanon''; and, lastly, two sets of drama CDs, totaling nine in all.

==Gameplay==

The ''Clannad'' orbs, which can be obtained after a characters' scenario is completed;<ref></ref> one of the lights will disappear while still in School Life, but will reappear in After Story. School Life contains the main protagonist's final year of high school, in which he meets all of the characters in the game, though the focus is kept on the five heroines in the story. After Story is mainly a continuation of Nagisa's story, and is set immediately after School Life when Nagisa and Tomoya are now living their lives as a couple, and extends into the next ten years. Characters from School Life do appear, but play minor roles compared to their roles in that arc. In order to view the true ending of ''Clannad'', all thirteen lights must be obtained.

''Clannad'''s gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the game screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. An important aspect of ''Clannad'' (as in nearly every visual novel) are the "decision points" which appear every so often which give the player the chance to choose from a limited number of options. The time between these decision points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. The game pauses at such moments and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story, and there are a total of thirteen possible endings. Each plot line can be achieved through multiple replays.

''Clannad'' is Key's longest work, as evidenced in an interview of Air''. However, this does not take into account the minigames in ''Little Busters!'' which serve to lengthen the game.<ref></ref> While both of Key's first two previous works, ''adult games and then censored for the younger market like most bishōjo games, Key's third work ''Clannad'' was released for all-ages and does not contain risqué situations or even any fan service.<ref name="Clannad-VN"/>

==Plot==
===Setting and themes===
The first half of the story takes place at a high school in Japan, which is the best school in the city. This high school is largely modeled after the University of Tsukuba-affiliated junior-high and high school Komaba in Setagaya, Tokyo, Japan.<ref> </ref> Throughout the story, glimpses into an Illusionary World are shown. This world is devoid of all life except for a young girl, though she later makes a body out of junk pieces through which the player can interact with her. The remaining half of the story takes place in the same city, after the conclusion of the first half.

There are recurring themes that appear throughout the story. The main theme is the value of having a family, as the title of the series implies since according to Irish.<ref name="pre-Clannad"/> Of the six main characters, Tomoya, Nagisa, and Kotomi have no siblings, though their parents factor in majorly in their stories. Fuko's and Kyou's stories have their sisters playing an integral part, and Tomoyo's story is influenced by her entire family. In Nagisa's story, there is a recurring appearance of the  (a fictional group arrange album, a short music CD that contained remixed versions of songs in the game, that was released with the original game release was entitled ''Mabinogi'' which was a collection of Welsh Celtic, as is Irish.left|210px|thumb|The girls of ''Clannad'': Tomoyo (top-left), Kotomi (top-right), Fuko (bottom-left), Nagisa (center), and Kyou (bottom-right).

===Principal characters===

The player assumes the role of Tomoya Okazaki, the protagonist of ''Clannad''. Tomoya has been labeled a delinquent, or a young person who defies authority due to his non-committal attitude towards school and general Nagisa Furukawa, the main heroine of ''Clannad'', at the onset of the story. Nagisa is a soft-spoken girl who has very low Kyou Fujibayashi, another of ''Clannad'''s heroines, is a bad-mouthed and aggressive girl well known as a good cook among her friends and family. When angry she does not hesitate to throw a dictionary at people that she often carries around for such purposes. Despite this attitude, she also has a more subdued side, especially towards her younger fraternal twin sister Ryou Fujibayashi. 

Tomoya meets a Kotomi Ichinose, also a heroine, one day at school. She is ranked in the top ten throughout the whole country in standardized exam results of every subject—she always goes to library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages. Kotomi is a very quiet girl with poor social skills and it is quite difficult to communicate with her; Kotomi has even been known to completely ignore someone when reading, even if they make loud disturbances around her. ''Clannad'''s fourth heroine is a second-year student named Tomoyo Sakagami who transfers into Tomoya's school. Tomoyo, like Kyou, can be extremely aggressive, and Tomoyo is a very strong fighter, preferring to use kicking over punching, and has shown herself to be athletic. Although Tomoya is older than her, Tomoyo does not show him his due respect as a senior student. Tomoyo appears in Key's fifth game, ''Fuko Ibuki who has a distant attitude towards others and, before she met Tomoya, was generally seen alone by herself making wood carvings of euphoric bouts where her awareness of her surroundings is completely overtaken.

===Story===
''Clannad'''s story revolves around a group of five girls whose lives are connected to the same boy. Tomoya Okazaki is a third year high school student who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and held frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, again arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the wall, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Additionally, the injury disables Tomoya from participating in his basketball club, and pushes him to distance himself from his school and other activities. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who got thrown out of the soccer club for a dispute, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.

The story opens on Monday April 14 2003 at the beginning of the school year, when Tomoya finds that his life is about to change when he chances upon Nagisa Furukawa, a soft-spoken girl one year older than him who is repeating her last year in high school due to being sick much of the previous year. Her goal is to join the drama club which she was unable to do due to her sickness, but they find that the drama club was disbanded after all the members graduated. Since Tomoya has a lot of time to kill, he starts to help Nagisa in reforming the drama club. During this period, Tomoya meets and hangs out with several other girls who he gets to know well and help with their individual problems.

In the second part of the story, which starts immediately after the end of the first part, but extends into the next ten years, Tomoya and Nagisa live together as a family. Tomoya has to endure several hardships that the family has been suffering from, mainly involving Nagisa's illness. However, just after Nagisa gave birth to their first child, Ushio, she dies, leaving Tomoya to fall into a state of depression which causes Nagisa's parents, Akio and Sanae to look after Ushio. Five years later, Tomoya meets Shino Okazaki, his grandmother on his father's side. Shino explains to Tomoya about his father's past and tragedy, similar to Tomoya's current situation after Nagisa's death. After hearing that, he decides to raise Ushio and acknowledge Naoyuki as his father. Unfortunately, Ushio is struck with the same disease as Nagisa not long after this event. In the coming winter, wanting to do anything for Ushio, Tomoya brings Ushio for a trip, but Ushio fell unconscious and dies shortly after, and presumably Tomoya dies. Wanting to save themselves from this tragic fate, Ushio becomes the girl in the illusionary world, calling garbage doll (Tomoya) to collect the happiness around the city to create a miracle and save Nagisa and themselves.

Tomoya's psychology is further developed in his dreams of a bleak world called the . In the first few dreams of that kind, he sees a world which is devoid of all people except for one girl, whom is never shown in the original game but is spoken of (she is shown in the anime version). Each time he dreams, he finds out more about the world. Later on, Tomoya finds out that the girl has a special ability to fuse junk together to create new things, with which she creates a body for him. Thus he is reborn in this world, and fills time following the girl around. Tomoya conceives that only the two of them are "alive". To pass time, Tomoya and the girl try to build another doll with more junk they find, but as it has no soul, it fails to come to life. Eventually, winter sets in, and the girl becomes cold to the point where she cannot move any more. Remembering a distant world where he came from, Tomoya convinces the girl to build a ship so that the two can escape the winter and continue a happy life. However, their flight is doomed to meet tragedy.

==Sypnosis==
Tomoya Okazaki est un lycéen en troisième année. Il entretient une mauvaise relation avec son père depuis que celui-ci est devenu alcoolique, et qu'une dispute a amené son père à le blesser à l'épaule. Une distance s'est donc installée depuis longtemps entre eux deux: Tomoya préfère pour cette raison traîner hors de chez lui, et commence à être considéré comme un délinquant. 
Il n'aime pas la vie qu'il mène. Mais sa rencontre avec Nagisa va changer sa vie. Il commença alors à rêver d'un monde sombre habité seulement par une jeune fille capable de créer des objets en assemblant des ordures. Cette fille fabrique un corps pour Tomoya, et ces deux-là constituent les seuls "survivants" de ce monde.

==Personnages principaux==

'''Tomoya Okazaki'''  est le protagoniste de ''Clannad''. Il sèche les cours, et passe ses nuits dehors, ce qui lui vaut une réputation de délinquant. Depuis la mort de sa mère Atsuko dans un accident de voiture, il vit seul avec son père, avec qui il se dispute trop souvent. Joueur de Basketball, il fut contraint d'arrêter lorsque son père le blessa à l'épaule au cours d'une dispute. Depuis, il est devenu très distant avec son père. Il dégage une image de rebelle et plutôt méchante, mais possède en fait un bon cœur.

'''Nagisa Furukawa'''  est l'héroïne principale de ''Clannad''. A cause d'une maladie qui dura neuf mois, elle redouble sa 3ème année de lycée: Elle se sent seule ainsi car tous ses amis ont quitté le lycée. C'est dans ces circonstances qu'elle sympathise avec Tomoya, qu'elle rencontre le jour de la rentrée sur le chemin du lycée. Elle a le désir de recréer le club de théâtre du lycée, mais elle n'a pas vraiment confiance en elle et a souvent besoin d'aide pour se motiver.

'''Kyou Fujibayashi''' est une fille au caractère fort.
