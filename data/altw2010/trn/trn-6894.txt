'''William Roger Clemens''' (born Dayton, American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball currently a free agent.  Clemens played in the majors for 24 seasons for the Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, New York Yankees, and Houston Astros, from  to .  Clemens won seven Cy Young Awards, two more than any other pitcher.

Clemens debuted in the majors in  with the triple crown (leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts) and a Cy Young Award. 

Clemens was traded to the Randy Johnson, and Steve Carlton). Clemens played three seasons with the Houston Astros, where he won his seventh Cy Young Award. He rejoined the New York Yankees during the  season.   

Clemens was alleged by the Mitchell Report to have used anabolic steroids during his late career, but he has firmly denied the truth of such allegations.  

==Early life==
Clemens' parents separated when he was an infant. His mother soon remarried Woody Booher, whom Clemens still considers his father. Booher died when Clemens was only nine years old, and Clemens has said that the only time he ever felt jealous of other players is when he saw them in the clubhouse with their fathers.<ref name="22 Things">Story, Mark, [http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/sports/14749611.htm "22 Things You Should Know About 'Rocket' "], ''Houston, Clemens also starred in football and basketball.<ref name="22 Things" /> He was scouted by the Philadelphia Phillies and Minnesota Twins during his senior year, but opted instead to go to college.<ref></ref>

==Professional career==
===Boston Red Sox (1984-96)===
Clemens was drafted 19th overall by the World Series and earned Clemens the MVP award for the regular season. He also won the first of his seven Cy Young Awards. 

Hall of Fame slugger crack his head open to show him how valuable I was."<ref name="22 Things" /> Clemens remains the only starting pitcher since Vida Blue in  to win a league MVP award.

On strike out 20 batters in a nine-inning major league game, against the Kerry Wood and Randy Johnson have matched the total. (Johnson's 20-strikeout performance was originally catalogued separately by MLB because it occurred in the first nine innings of an extra-inning game, but has since been accepted. Tom Cheney holds the record for any game: 21 strikeouts in 16 innings.) Clemens attributes his switch from what he calls a "thrower" to a "pitcher" to the partial season Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver spent with the Red Sox in 1986. <ref>"Sports Illustrated," October 1986</ref>

Clemens accomplished the 20-strikeout feat twice, the only player ever to do so.  The second performance came more than 10 years later, on Tiger Stadium. Clemens' second 20-K day occurred in his second-to-last game as a member of the Boston Red Sox.  

Clemens recorded 192 wins for the Red Sox, tied with Cy Young for the franchise record.  No Red Sox player has worn his #21 since Clemens left the team in 1996.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1997-98)===
Notoriously, Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette said that Clemens was in the "twilight of his career" following four consecutive seasons, 1993-96, in which the pitcher was a mediocre 40-39 with few of the eye-popping statistics that had become his norm.  The Red Sox opted not to re-sign him following the 1996 season. However, the full quote from which "twilight" is excerpted was not entirely negative, and also referred to Red Sox management's stated hope that Clemens would spend his entire career with Boston.<ref></ref>

Clemens signed with the Triple Crown twice.  Some consider Clemens' tenure with the Blue Jays as his best individual seasons of his career, despite the lackluster records the Blue Jays had as a team.

In Clemens' first start in Fenway Park as a member of the Blue Jays (July 12, 1997) he pitched an inspired game, giving up only 4 hits and 1 run in 8 innings. 16 of his 24 outs were strikeouts, and every batter who faced him struck out at least once.<ref>[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B07120BOS1997.htm Retrosheet complete box score]</ref>

The emphasis on the 1996 "twilight" quote took on a life of its own following Clemens' post-Boston successes, and Duquette was vilified for letting the star pitcher go.<ref>{{cite web

===New York Yankees (1999-2003)===
Clemens was traded to the Paul O'Neill, Clemens initially wore #12, before switching mid-season to #22.

Clemens made an immediate impact on the Yankees' staff, anchoring the top of the rotation as the team went on to win a pair of World Series titles in 1999 and 2000.  During the 1999 regular season, Clemens posted a 14-10 record with a 4.6 ERA.  He logged a pair of wins in the postseason, where he pitched 7.2 innings of 1-run baseball during the Yankees' game 4 clincher over the Game 4 of the ALCS.  A seventh inning lead-off double by Seattle's Al Martin was all that prevented Clemens from throwing just the second no-hitter in postseason history (Yankee Game 5 of the 1956 World Series).

Clemens' best year with the Yankees came in 2001, when he became the first pitcher in MLB history to start a season 20-1. He finished at 20-3 and won his sixth Cy Young Award.  Clemens started for the Yankees in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he dueled Curt Schilling to a standstill after 6 innings, letting by only one run.  The Diamondbacks went on to win the game in the 9th.  

Early in , Clemens announced his retirement, effective at the end of that season. On 300th career win and 4,000th career strikeout, the only player in history to record both milestones in the same game. The 300th win came on his fourth try; the Yankee bullpen had blown his chance of a win in his previous two attempts. He became the 21st pitcher ever to record 300 wins and the third ever to record 4,000 strikeouts, joining Nolan Ryan (5,714) and Steve Carlton (4,136). Randy Johnson has since also joined the 4,000 strikeout club. His career record upon reaching the milestones was 300-155; his record at the end of the season was 310-160 with 4,099 strikeouts. Clemens finished the season with a 17-9 record and a 3.91 ERA.  

The end of Clemens' 2003 season became a series of public farewells met with appreciative cheering. His last games in each AL park were given extra attention, particularly his final regular season appearance in Fenway Park, when despite wearing the uniform of the hated arch rival, he was afforded a standing ovation by Red Sox fans as he left the field. (This spectacle was repeated when the Yankees ended up playing the Red Sox in that year's ALCS and Clemens got a second "final start" in his original stadium.) As part of a tradition of manager Joe Torre's, Clemens was chosen to manage the Yankees' last game of the regular season. Clemens made one start in the World Series against the Florida Marlins; when he left trailing 3-1 after seven innings, the Marlins left their dugout to give him a standing ovation.

===Houston Astros (2004-06)===
Clemens chose to un-retire, signing a one-year deal with his adopted hometown Randy Johnson.  In Houston, Clemens wore # 22, his number with the Yankees, partly because Pettitte chose # 21, in Clemens' honor.

Clemens again decided to put off retirement before the  season after the MLB history. It also made him the sixth-highest paid player in baseball that year.

Clemens' 2005 season ended as one of the finest he had ever posted. His 1.87 ERA was the lowest in the major leagues, the lowest of his 22-season career, and the lowest by any National Leaguer since pitching great and contemporary rival shut out nine times in Clemens' 32 starts, and failed to score in a 10th until after Clemens was out of the game.  The Astros lost five Clemens starts by scores of 1-0. In April, Clemens did not allow a run in three consecutive starts. However, the Astros lost all three of those starts by a 1-0 score in extra innings.

He has more career wins than any other right-handed pitcher of the live-ball era. On April 8, , Clemens won his first start of the season against the Cincinnati Reds, which tied him with Steve Carlton for second in wins for live-ball pitchers, and first among pitchers whose career began after World War II. However, it took him a month to surpass Carlton, as he had low run support in a string of five starts that produced one loss and four no-decisions. On May 9, he got his second win of the season against the Florida Marlins, giving him 330 for his career. Only left-hander Warren Spahn is ahead of Clemens in wins among live-ball pitchers.  Passing Carlton also gave Clemens more wins than any pitcher alive. The only current pitcher with a reasonable chance of passing Clemens in the near future is Maddux, who now has 350 wins to Clemens' 353 and is nearly four years younger. 

Clemens won an emotional start on September 15th, following his mother's death that morning<ref>usatoday.com, [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/games/2005-09-14-marlins-astros_x.htm?csp=36 Clemens wins one for his late mother], accessed January 27, 2007 </ref>.  In his final start of the 2005 season, Clemens got his 4,500th strikeout. On October 9, , Clemens made his first relief appearance since 1984, entering as a pinch hitter in the 15th, then pitching three innings to help the Astros defeat the Atlanta Braves in the longest postseason game in MLB history. The game ran 18 innings, and Clemens picked up the win.

After the NLCS victory, Clemens lasted only two innings in Game 1 of the 2005 World Series. The Astros went on to lose all four games of the franchise's first World Series to the Chicago White Sox.  A hamstring pull had hampered Clemens's performance since at least September.

The Astros declined arbitration to Clemens on December 7, , which prevented them from re-signing him before May 1, . The Astros, Rangers, Red Sox, and Yankees expressed an interest in signing him, but Clemens implied that he was finally retiring after his Team USA was eliminated by Mexico in the second round from the 2006 World Baseball Classic on March 16, 2006.<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/top/news;_ylt=Ai_ipdhobAB.ZBjP5UqlCX05nYcB?slug=ap-classic-us-mexico&prov=ap&type=lgns Yahoo! Sports - Sports News, Scores, Rumors, Fantasy Games, and more<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  However, there was no formal retirement announcement.

On May 31, 2006, following another extended period of speculation, it was announced that Clemens was coming out of retirement for the third time to pitch for the Astros for the remainder of the 2006 season. Clemens signed a contract worth $22,000,022 (his uniform number is # 22), which would have been the highest one-year deal in MLB history. But since Clemens did not play a full season, he received a prorated percentage of that: approximately $12.25 million. Clemens made his return on June 22, 2006, against the Minnesota Twins, losing to their rookie phenom, Francisco Liriano, 4-2.  For the second year in a row, his win total did not match his performance, as he finished the season with a 7-6 record, a 2.30 ERA, and a 1.04 WHIP.  However, Clemens averaged just under 6 innings in his starts and never pitched into the eighth.

===New York Yankees (2007)===
Following what was becoming familiar annual speculation, Clemens unexpectedly appeared in the owner's box at Yankee Stadium on May 6, , and made a brief statement: ''"Thank y'all. Well they came and got me out of Texas, and uhh, I can tell you its a privilege to be back. I'll be talkin' to y'all soon."'' It was simultaneously announced that Clemens had rejoined the Yankees roster<ref>Associated Press, [http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/sports/AP-BBA-Yankees-Clemens.html "Roger Clemens Is Returning to the Yankees"], ''NYTimes.com'', May 6, 2007.</ref>, agreeing to a pro-rated one year deal worth $28,000,022, or about $4.5 million per month. <ref></ref> 

Clemens made his 2007 return on June 9, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates with six innings of 3 -run, 5-hit, 2-walk, 7-strikeout pitching.  On June 21, with a single in the 5th inning against the Colorado Rockies, Clemens became the oldest New York Yankee to record a hit (44 years, 321 days). On June 24, Clemens pitched an inning in relief against the San Francisco Giants. It had been 22 years and 341 days since his previous regular-season relief appearance, the longest such gap in major league history.<ref></ref>

On July 2, Clemens collected his 350th win against the Minnesota Twins at Yankee Stadium, giving up just two hits and one run over eight innings. Clemens is one of only three pitchers to pitch his entire career in the live-ball era and reach 350 wins.  The other two are Warren Spahn (whose catcher for his 350th win was Joe Torre, Clemens' manager for his 350th), and Greg Maddux, who earned his 350th win in 2008.

After reaggravating a hamstring injury during an October 7 postseason matchup, Joe Torre removed Roger Clemens from the team's lineup. He was replaced by left-hander Ron Villone.<ref></ref>

Clemens finished the 2007 season with a record of 6-6 and a 4.15 ERA.  He started for the Yankees in two crucial late season victories against the Boston Red Sox, in which he surrendered 2 runs in 12 innings. In these two games, Clemens outpitched Red Sox pitchers Josh Beckett and Curt Schilling.

==Postseason performance==
In the 1986 ALCS, Clemens pitched poorly in the opening game, watched the Boston bullpen blow his 3-0 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 4, and then pitched a strong Game 7 to wrap up the series for Boston. The 1986 ALCS clincher was Clemens' first postseason career victory. He did not win his second until 13 years later.

After a bad start in Game 2 of the John McNamara claimed Clemens took himself out due to a blister, though Clemens strongly denies that.<ref name="slate">Nocera, Joseph, [http://www.slate.com/id/91141/ "Roger Clemens, Choke Artist"], ''Slate.com'', October 10, 2000.</ref>

Clemens most explosive postseason failure came in the second inning of the final game of the 1990 ALCS against the Oakland Athletics, when he was ejected for arguing with umpire Terry Cooney, putting a dismal stamp on an A's sweep.<ref name="slate" /> He was suspended for the first five games of the  season and fined $10,000.<ref name="library" /> Clemens had two other playoff no-decisions, in 1988 and 1995, both occurring while Boston was being swept.  Clemens's overall postseason record with Boston was 1-2 with a 3.88 ERA, and 45 strikeouts and 19 walks in 56 innings.

After surrendering the New York Yankees' only loss in the 1999 playoffs in a much-hyped contest with Red Sox ace ALCS against the Seattle Mariners: a complete game one-hit shutout with an ALCS-record 15 strikeouts.  Clemens's overall postseason record with the Yankees has been 7-4 with a 3.17 ERA, and 98 strikeouts and 35 walks in 102 innings.

'''William Roger Clemens''' (* Dayton, Ohio), Spitzname '''„The Rocket“''' ist einer der bekanntesten Pitcher der Major League Baseball. In der Saison 2007 stand er bei den New York Yankees unter Vertrag. Sein erstes Spiel in der MLB bestritt Clemens am 15. Mai 1984 für die Boston Red Sox, bei denen er 13 Spielzeiten als ''Starting Pitcher'' unter Vertrag stand.

== Karriere ==
=== Boston Red Sox (1984–1996) ===
Im Jahr 1983 wurde Clemens von den gedraftet und durchlief in der Folge zügig das Minor-League-System. Bereits am 15. Mai 1984 gab er sein Debüt in der Major League.

Mit seinen 24 Siegen als ''Starting Pitcher'' hatte Clemens großen Anteil daran, dass die Red Sox 1986 die MVP-Award der Innings 20 Schlagmänner mit einem Strikeout vom Feld zu schicken. Dieses Kunststück, welches ihm gegen die Seattle Mariners gelang konnte er zehn Jahre später (1996) gegen die Detroit Tigers sogar noch einmal wiederholen.

Obwohl Clemens Trikotnummer 21 bei den Red Sox nicht offiziell retired ist, hat sie seit dem er den Club verlassen hat kein anderer Spieler mehr getragen.

=== Toronto Blue Jays (1997–1998) ===
Nach seinem Trade zu den Blue Jays konnte Clemens in seinen beiden Spielzeiten in Kanada jeweils den Triple-Crown gewinnen.

Bei seinem ersten Heimspiel im Dress der Blue Jays machte Clemens eines seiner besten Spiele überhaupt, indem er nur vier Hits und einen einzigen Run in acht gespielten Innings zuließ. Unter den 24 Outs, die er warf, waren ganze 16 Strikeouts.

=== New York Yankees (1999–2003) ===
Der Trade zu den New York Yankees war für Clemens die Möglichkeit, endlich die World Series gewinnen zu können, was ihm schließlich in den Jahren 1999 und 2000 auch gelang.

Am 8. Juli 2000 ereignete sich ein Vorfall zwischen Clemens und dem Catcher Grand Slam geschlagen. Das erste Wiedersehen nach diesem Vorfall fand ausgerechnet in der World Series 2000 statt, welche beide New Yorker Clubs, also die Yankees als auch die Mets erreichten.

Zu Beginn des Jahres 2003 gab Clemens erstmals seinen Rücktritt vom Profisport bekannt, den er am Ende der Saison vollziehen wollte. Am 13. Juni 2003 erreichte Clemens bei Spiel gegen die St. Louis Cardinals gleich zwei wichtige Meilensteine eines Pitchers in einem Spiel. Zum einen war es der 300. Sieg in seiner Karriere und zum anderen konnte Clemens in diesem Spiel seinen 4000. Strikeout werfen.

=== Houston Astros (2004-2006) ===
Im Jahre 2004 beschloss Clemens, doch noch vom Ruhestand zurückzutreten und unterschrieb einen Einjahresvertrag bei den Houston Astros. Im Mai 2004 konnte sich Clemens mit seinem 4137. Strikeout in der ewigen Bestenliste auf Platz 2 hinter den Rekordhalter Nolan Ryan (5714 Strikeouts) setzen. Clemens kündigte an, nach der Saison 2004 zurückzutreten.

Aber auch dieser Rücktritt hatte nur kurz bestand. Die Astros boten ihm für die Saison 2005 ein Jahresgehalt von 13,5&nbsp;Mio.&nbsp;US-Dollar. Clemens forderte 22&nbsp;Mio. und am Ende einigte man sich auf einen Einjahresvertrag über 18.000.022&nbsp;US-Dollar. Dass Clemens noch längst nicht zum alten Eisen gehörte, bewies er, indem er in seinem 22. Profijahr mit 1,87 den besten ''Earned Run Average'' (ERA; durchschnittliche Punkte, die pro neun Innings an den Gegner abgegeben werden) seiner Karriere erreichte. Auch dank ihm erreichten die Astros die World Series 2005, bei der Clemens allerdings nur zwei Innings (in Spiel 1) warf. Die Astros verloren durch einen Sweep der Chicago White Sox.

Clemens wollte nach der Saison zum dritten mal seine Karriere beenden unterschrieb aber erneut einen Einjahresvertrag mit einem Gehalt von 22.000.022&nbsp;US-Dollar. Dies wäre die höchste Summe, die jemals für eine Saison in der MLB bezahlt worden ist. Wenn Clemens allerdings nicht die ganze Saison spielt erhält er nur einen Teil der Summe (etwa 12&nbsp;Mio.&nbsp;US-Dollar). Clemens kehrte am 22.&nbsp;Juni 2006 gegen die Minnesota Twins zurück auf den Hügel, verlor allerdings gegen den Rookie Francisco Liriano mit 2:4.
