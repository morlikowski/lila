'''California''' () is a state located on the West Coast of the most populous U.S. state, California's capital city is Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, and San Francisco. California is known for its varied climate and geography, as well as for its ethnically diverse population. The state is divided into 58 counties.

Before becoming a part of the United States, Alta California was colonized by the Spanish Empire, beginning in 1769. Alta California became a part of the newly independent nation of Mexico in 1821, and remained so until 1846. That year, an independent California Republic was declared. The Republic's first and only president was William B. Ide,<ref>[http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=458 ''William B. Ide Adobe SHP'']</ref> who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt. His term lasted twenty-five days and concluded when California was occupied by U.S. forces during the Mexican-American War. Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, Mexico formally ceded California to the United States. California was admitted to the Union as the 31st state on September 9, 1850. 

California is the third largest U.S. state by land area; it contains a diverse geography, which ranges from the sandy and rocky beaches of the Pacific coast, to the rugged snow-capped Sierra Nevada mountains in the east, to Central Valley, one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world and the largest of any U.S. state. The Sierra Nevada mountains contain California White Mountains are the oldest in the world; one Bristlecone pine has an age of 4,700 years.

The largest economies in the world, and were it a separate country, it would be 34<sup>th</sup> amongst the most populous countries, just behind Poland, as well as the world's sixth-largest economy.

The word ''California'' originally referred to the entire region composed of the current U.S. state of California, plus all or parts of Baja California.

The name ''California'' is most commonly believed to have derived from a storied paradise peopled by black The Exploits of Esplandian'', written as a sequel to ''García Ordóñez Rodríguez de Montalvo.<ref></ref> The kingdom of Queen Califia, according to Montalvo, was said to be a remote land inhabited by griffins and other strange beasts and rich in gold.

==Geography and environment ==

thumb|left|California's Central Valley, the agricultural hub of the state and the primary agricultural provider of the nation.

California borders the Mexican state of km²) it is the third largest state in the United States in size, after Alaska and Texas. If it were a country, California would be the 59th largest in the world, between Iraq and Paraguay.

California's geography is rich, complex, and varied. In the middle of the state lies the coastal mountain ranges in the west, the Sierra Nevada to the east, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta serves as a critical water supply hub for the state.  Water is routed through an extensive network of canals and pumps out of the delta, that traverse nearly the length of the state, including the Central Valley Project, and the State Water Project. Water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23&nbsp;million people, almost two-thirds of the state's population, and provides water to farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley.  The Channel Islands are located off the southern coast. 
thumb|left|Yosemite Valley

The Sierra Nevada (Spanish for "snowy range") include the highest peak in the contiguous forty-eight states, migratory bird habitat. In the western part of the state is Clear Lake, the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California. Though Lake Tahoe is larger, it is divided by the California/Nevada border.  The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers, including Palisade Glacier, the southernmost glacier in the United States.

thumb|upright|Rolling hills of California

About 35% of the state's total surface area is covered by forests, and California's diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state.  California contains more forestland than any other state except Alaska. In the south is a large inland salt lake, the Mojave; to the northeast of the Mojave lies Badwater Flat. The distance from the lowest point of Death Valley to the peak of Mount Whitney is less than 200&nbsp;miles (322 km). Indeed, almost all of southeastern California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer.

Along the California coast are several major metropolitan areas, including San Diego. 

California is famous for earthquakes due to a number of faults, in particular the wildfires, and volcanoes.

===Climate===

California climate varies from Mediterranean to subarctic. Much of the state has a Mediterranean climate, with cool, rainy winters and dry summers.  The cool California Current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast. Further inland, one encounters colder winters and hotter summers. 

Northern parts of the state average higher annual rainfall than the south. California's mountain ranges influence the climate as well: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a Sierra Nevada, have a mountain climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer. 

The east side of California's mountains has a drier rain shadow. The low deserts east of the southern California mountains experience hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters; the higher elevation deserts of eastern California see hot summers and cold winters. In Death Valley, the highest temperature in the Western Hemisphere, 134&nbsp;°F (56.6&nbsp;°C), was recorded July 10, 1913.

===Ecology===

Ecologically, California is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities. California is part of the Nearctic ecozone and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions.

thumb|right|200px||Calaveras Big Trees State Park
California's large number of endemic species includes relict species which have died out elsewhere, such as the Catalina Ironwood (''Lyonothamnus floribundus''). Many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation, whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac (''Ceanothus''). Many California endemics have become endangered, as urbanization, logging, overgrazing, and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat.

California boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora; the largest trees, the tallest trees, and the oldest trees. California's native grasses are perennial plants.<ref></ref><ref></ref> After European contact, these were generally replaced by invasive species of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California's hills turn a characteristic golden brown in summer.

=== Rivers ===

Arguably, the two most prominent rivers within California are the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River, which drain the Central Valley and flow to the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay. Two other important rivers are the Klamath River, in the north, and the Colorado River, on the southeast border.

==History==

Settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000 years, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian 70 distinct groups of Native Americans.  Large, settled populations lived on the coast and hunted sea mammals, fished for salmon, and gathered shellfish, while groups in the interior hunted terrestrial game and gathered nuts, acorns, and berries.  California groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands, tribes, villages, and on the resource-rich coasts, large chiefdoms, such as the Chumash, Pomo and Salinan.  Trade, intermarriage, and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups. 

The first European to explore the coast as far north as the Russian River was the Portuguese English explorer Francis Drake also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579.  Spanish traders made unintended visits with the Manila Galleons on their return trips from the Philippines beginning in 1565.  Sebastián Vizcaíno explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for New Spain.

Spanish mission in Alta California was established at San Diego in 1769.<ref>The first successful mission in chain of missions became the property of the Mexican government, and were secularized by 1832. The ranchos developed under ownership by Californios (Spanish-speaking Californians) who had received land grants and traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants.

Beginning in the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the United States and Canada began to arrive in Northern California, harbingers of the great changes that would later sweep the Mexican territory. These new arrivals used the Old Spanish Trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts surrounding California. In this period, Imperial Russia explored the California coast, and established a trading post at Fort Ross.

200px|thumb|The Bear Flag of the Republic of California

In 1846, settlers rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt. Afterwards, rebels raised the Bear Flag (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe, and the words "California Republic") at Sonoma.

However, the California Republic was to be short lived. The same year marked the outbreak of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). When Commodore John D. Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into Monterey Bay and began the military occupation of California by the United States. Northern California capitulated in less than a month to the US forces.  

Following a series of defensive battles in Southern California, including; The Siege of Los Angeles, the Battle of Dominguez Rancho, the Battle of San Pascual, the Battle of Rio San Gabriel and the Battle of La Mesa, the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed by the Californios on January 13, 1847, securing American control in California. 

Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the war, the region was divided between Mexico and the United States; the western territory of Alta California, was to become the U.S. state of California, and the Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah Territories, while the lower region of California, Baja California, remained in the possession of Mexico.

In 1848, the non-native population of California has been estimated to be no more than 15,000. But after gold was discovered, the population burgeoned with U.S. citizens, Europeans, and other immigrants during the great free state (one in which slavery was prohibited).

The seat of government for California under Mexican rule was located at Monterey from 1777 until 1835, when Mexican authorities abandoned California, leaving their missions and military forts behind.<ref></ref> In 1849, the Constitutional Convention was first held there.  Among the duties was the task of determining the location for the new State capital.  The first legislative sessions were held in San Jose (1850-1851).  Subsequent locations included Vallejo (1852-1853), and nearby Benicia (1853-1854), although these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well.  The capital has been located in Sacramento since 1854.<ref></ref>

At first, travel between California and the central and eastern parts of the United States was time-consuming and dangerous. A more direct connection came in 1869 with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad through Donner Pass in the Sierra Nevada mountains. After this rail link was established, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens came west, where new Californians were discovering that land in the state, if irrigated during the dry summer months, was extremely well-suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat and other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere.

During the early 20th century, migration to California accelerated with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the Route 66. In the period from 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the Union. From 1965 to the present, the population changed radically and became one of the most diverse in the world. The state is regarded as a world center of technology and engineering businesses, the entertainment and music industries, and of U.S. agricultural production.

==Energy==
===Resources and consumption===
California’s crude oil and  Central Valley and along the coast. California has more than one dozen of the United State’s largest geothermal and solar power potential is found in southeastern California’s deserts.
 
California is the most populous State in the Nation but its total energy demand is second to the state of country. This is in spite of the fact that more commute times are among the longest in the country.

===Petroleum===
California’s crude oil output accounts for more than one-tenth of total U.S. production. Drilling operations are concentrated primarily in Kern County and the Los Angeles basin. Although there is also substantial offshore oil and gas production, there is a  permanent moratorium on new offshore oil and gas leasing in California waters and a deferral of leasing in Federal waters. 

California ranks third in the United States in petroleum environmental regulations. 

Most California motorists are required to use a special motor gasoline blend called California Clean Burning Gasoline (CA CBG). By 2004, California completed a transition from methyl tertiary butyl-ether (MTBE) to ethanol as a gasoline oxygenate additive, making California the largest ethanol fuel market in the United States. There are four ethanol production plants in central and southern California, but most of California’s ethanol supply is transported from other states or abroad.

===Natural gas===
California pipeline from production regions in the Rocky Mountains, the Southwest, and western Canada.

===Electricity===
Natural gas-fired power plants typically account for more than one-half of State electricity generation. California is one of the largest hydroelectric power producers in the United States, and with adequate rainfall, hydroelectric power typically accounts for close to one-fifth of State electricity generation. Due to strict emission laws, only a few small coal-fired power plants operate in California. 

The "Solar One" and "Solar Two" produce 10 MW each. 

California’s two nuclear power plants account for almost one-fifth of total generation, these are:<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/at_a_glance/states/statesca.html State Nuclear Industry - California<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.energy.ca.gov/nuclear/california.html Nuclear Energy in California<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
