}}'''Clapham Junction Waterloo and Victoria.

By throughput Clapham Junction is claimed to be the busiest railway station in Britain, and even in Europe, though it is far less highly ranked by the standard measure of journeys originated at the station, as most passengers pass straight through. It is the busiest station in the UK by the number of interchanges, which accounts for 2/5 of activity at the station.

==The station==
===Services===
All services to Waterloo, and many services to Victoria and the Croydon stations pass through the junction; these include Southern services. Services from Clapham Junction also head north along the West Brompton and Kensington (Olympia), on to Willesden Junction (Watford Junction (Southern services). Services from Brighton to Manchester pass through on a scarce appearance heading up past Kensington (Olympia) (CrossCountry).

The typical off-peak (1300hrs) service from the station is: (tph = trains per hour)

The station has 16 active platforms, numbered 2 to 17, and arranged in two groups.  Platform 1, the northernmost platform, is no longer used, having no rails; portable buildings have been sited at the north-east end, and a portable building and power or signalling equipment housings at the south-west end. If the planned East London Line extension gets to Clapham Junction, it is possible that platform 1 would be used for the purpose. Platform 2, for the West London Line, and 3 to 6, for the Windsor lines, form a northern group oriented in a west-south-westerly direction, whilst platforms 7 to 17, on the South-Western and Brighton main lines, form a southern group oriented in a south-westerly direction and are separated from the northern group by a fan of a dozen or more sidings running into railway sheds to the west of the station.

The main entrance is from St. John's Hill, into a subway some 15 ft (4.6 m) wide running transversely beneath the eastern end of the 17 platforms, and on to a northern exit, which has restricted opening hours.  The subway becomes very crowded during the morning and evening rush hours: ticket barriers at the end are a particular pinch point.

A covered footbridge connects the platforms at their western end. In contrast with the width of the subway, parts of the footbridge are vast, but unfortunately the footbridge does not provide entry to or exit from the station. Network Rail announced in 2007 a package of improvements to access at Clapham Junction, including re-opening the Brighton Yard entrance on St Johns Hill and installing lifts to the platforms; the scheme is due for completion in 2009.<ref name="Improvements">[http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/BusinessPlan2007/PDF/Route%203%20South%20West%20Main%20Line.pdf Route Plans 2007 - Route 3 - South West Mainline] published by Network Rail, 2007. See page 20.</ref>

The station has limited pay-for-use toilet facilities; drinks and confectionery kiosks in the underpass, the overpass, and on some platforms; and a small shopping centre forming the St. John's Hill entrance.

===Technology===
In the recent past, in part because of the large number of platforms and trains, the station was confusing for those unfamiliar with it, who often found it difficult to establish from which platform a particular train would run. In 2003 a reasonably extensive system of electronic train information displays was installed at the entrance, in the subway and on platforms. In May 2004, the ticket machines were moved and reduced in number from six to four, only two of which take credit cards, and all of which are prone to frequent breakdown - this prompted a significant number of complaints from customers, leading to reinstallation of the two removed machines in winter 2004.  There are seven staffed ticket kiosk windows, but purchasing tickets in the morning rush hour, and from time to time through the day, tends to involve a lengthy delay. In March 2005, work began to alter the layout of the travel centre and to install a set of eight new ticket machines; these were installed in April 2006. Only two of these machines accept cash payments; the excessive queueing times for these has also provoked complaints.

===Busiest station claims===
Clapham Junction has claimed to being the busiest railway station in the United Kingdom, and on 17 June 2005 changed its signage and claim, to be the busiest in Europe. Some 2,000 trains pass though it each day, the majority of which stop. Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is the world's busiest railway station in terms of passenger numbers, and sees far more trains than Clapham Junction.

==The junction==
The station is named Clapham Junction because it forms the junction of a number of major rail lines. The name is not shared by any actual rail junction in the locality of the station. The names of the nearby rail junctions are:
* Falcon Jn (at the south end of the station, where the West London Line (WLL) joins the Brighton Slow Lines)
* Ludgate GW Jn (at the eastern end of the Windsor Line platforms with the WLL and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway)
* Latchmere Jns (where the three curves join the WLL)
* West London Jn (the junction where Eurostar empty stock leaves the Windsor Lines at to get onto the WLL)
* Pouparts Jn (where the low level and high level approaches to Victoria split)

==History==
Prior to the railway age,the area was rural and specialised in the growing of coach road from London to crossroads in the valley between St. John's and Lavender Hill.

The 19th century saw the rapid development of the railway system. The first railway through the area was the London and Southampton Railway, opened in 1838. That railway terminated at Nine Elms, near Vauxhall, about 2 km (1 mile) to the north east of the Clapham Junction site, and made no provision for a station at the site of the (by now renamed) Falcon pub.
