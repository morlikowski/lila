'''Catarman''' is a second class municipality in the province of Northern Samar, Philippines. It is the capital city of the province. According to the 2007 census, it has a population of 67,671 people in 12,437 households.  In recent years, the growth of the municipality has been rapid - new business firms mushrooming in its business district.

Catarman is on the shoulder of Samar Island. The town is in the process of renewing its image as a poor and underdeveloped town in the 1980s.  Its cityhood was put to a halt (in 2003) after the mayors of neighboring towns Mondragon and Bobon declined the Catarman mayor's offer to include the said towns under the proposed Catarman City conglomeration.

==Education==

Catarman is home to the University of Eastern Philippines, which is the biggest university (both in terms of land area and curricular offerings) in Region 8 having 3 campuses (UEP Main, Laoang and Catubig) and some extension programs scattered across the Samar Island catering to 15,000 students. It started in 1918 as the Catarman Farm School. In 1956, it was converted to Samar Institute of Technology. In order to provide a more extensive liberal education in the arts, humanities, natural and social sciences, and engineering and technology, SIT was again converted into a state university in 1964 and was named University of Eastern Philippines. At present, UEP is considered as the comprehensive state university in Eastern Visayas offering the largest number of programs in the undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate education.

Catarman has a number of secondary schools:
*'''ST. MICHAEL ACADEMY''' is the first Catholic school in the island to have been instituted. It caters only secondary courses, but is formerly catered to all levels of education. The school is run by the Congregation of the Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine of Siena, and is formerly known as St. Michael Junior College. A member of the OP-Siena Schools System, the school is known for its prestige and excellent achievements through its ages.

*'''NORTHERN SAMAR COLLEGES''' was founded in 1949 but was recognized as a private institution of higher learning in 1950. It offered both secondary and tertiary education. After the creation of the Samar Institute of Technology (now UEP) in 1957, the NSC discontinued its tertiary education offerings and retained the high school department, and was renamed Northern Samar Academy (NSA). After its reorgnization, the NSA, as a private, non-sectarian, and co-educational high school, committed itself in the delivery of quality education and was able to produce successful professionals and community leaders. In 2001, seeing the need to provide alternative tertiary and vocational education equipped with competent faculties and facilities, the NSA reopened its post high school program offerings and was renamed Northern Samar Colleges. Today, the NSC offers complete programs in preschool, elementary, high school, vocational, and tertiary education.

*'''CATARMAN NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL''' formerly Catarman Comprehensive High School is the largest secondary school in town both in population and land area.

*'''UNIVERSITY OF EASTERN PHILIPPINES LABORATORY HIGH SCHOOL''' is the secondary department of the University of Eastern Philippines. It is divided into two curricula - Science Stream (which offers advanced units in physics, chemistry, biology, maths, and genetics) and the Revised Basic Secondary Education Curriculum (the standard curriculum used in most Philippine secondary schools).  The UEPLHS is one of the most competitive secondary schools in the area - having the reputation of having a large percentage of UPCAT passers yearly, and winning academic competitions since its foundation.  It has been recognized as one of the most reputable state-run high schools in the Philippines.
