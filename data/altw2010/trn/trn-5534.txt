Iggulden's debut book was the ''''Emperor''. The series is loosely based around the life of Julius Caesar, from childhood (''The Gates of Rome'') to his eventual betrayal and death (''The Gods of War''). 

The series has been released, and well received internationally.  The film option has been sold to Spitfire Productions (an Intermedia company).

The author has indicated that in the future he may write a fifth book that deals with the events after the end of ''The Gods of War''. He mentions the possibility in the "Historical note" of the fourth book. Conn Iggulden has confirmed via email to a fan that he will indeed write a fifth book after concluding his Conqueror series.

After completing the ''Emperor'' series, Iggulden began research for his next series of books, the ''Conqueror'' series, based on the life of Genghis and Kublai Khan. His first book was available from 2007. ''Bones of the Hills'' has been confirmed as the next and third book in the Conqueror series to be released September 1, 2008.
