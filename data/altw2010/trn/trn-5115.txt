'''Quinten Hann''' (* australischer Poolbillard- und ehemaliger Snookerspieler. 

Hann startete seine Karriere als Snooker-Profi im Jahr 1995 und beendete seine Karriere vorzeitig Anfang 2006 aufgrund von Anschuldigungen von Reportern der britischen Boulevardzeitung ''The Sun'', er habe von ihnen Angebote für Spielabsprachen zum Wettbetrug angenommen. Zu zwei Anhörungen der ''World Snooker Association'' erschien er nicht und wurde in Abwesenheit für acht Jahre gesperrt. Zuletzt belegte er Platz 22 der Snookerweltrangliste. Seine größten Erfolge waren der Sieg bei der U-21-Weltmeisterschaft und das Erreichen des Halbfinals der ''Irish Masters'' im Jahr 2004. Nun strebt Hann eine Karriere auf der US-amerikanischen ''International Pool Tour'' an.

Quinten Hann galt aufgrund seines egozentrischen Wesens als Paradiesvogel bzw. als ''Enfant terrible'' der Snookerszene. Auch abseits des „grünen Tisches“ war der Australier häufig in den Schlagzeilen. Er musste sich mehrmals vor Gericht verantworten.

'''Quinten Hann''' (born WEPF World Eight-ball Champion. Prior to his eight-year ban<ref name="ban">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/4725612.stm BBC: "Guilty Hann given eight-year ban"], article on Hann's match-fixing and subsequent eight-year ban.</ref> in February 2006, he was one of the more temperamental players on the snooker circuit.

==Snooker career==
Hann was ranked in the top 16 for two seasons (2002-2003 and 2003-2004), ranked at #14 for both seasons. He has reached the quarter-finals of four ranking tournaments.

He missed several ranking events after breaking his wrist and collar bone whilst motorcycle racing in parachute jump in UK Championship.

Renowned for his volatile temper, Hann incurred the wrath of several other players throughout the course of his career. The first notable incidence of this occurred during the second round of the 2001 Grand Prix, where Hann repeatedly made offensive gestures towards both the spectators and his opponent, Anthony Hamilton. The latter showed no visible annoyance during the match itself, and went on to defeat Hann 5-3. In the post-match interview, however, the normally mild-mannered Hamilton was furious with his opponent, accusing him of bad sportsmanship and complaining not only about his behaviour towards the spectators but also his tactics. A number of times during the match Hann smashed the cue ball into the pack of reds at the beginning of each frame, spreading the reds over the table and consequently making breakbuilding difficult for both players, a tactic which was described by BBC commentator Clive Everton as bringing the sport into disrepute.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/in_depth/2000/uk_championship_snooker/1036217.stm BBC: "High, wide and Hann-some"], article discussing Hann's personality</ref> Although Hann later apologised to Hamilton for his behaviour in the match, he nevertheless continued to use this tactic to slow down faster opponents over the next couple of years. 

More recently, in the World Championships, he was rebuked for making threatening comments to Mark King stood in for Hicks at a charity boxing match with Hann which the latter won.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/funny_old_game/3797515.stm BBC: "Hann triumphs in Pot Whack"], Hann winning the boxing match with Mark King.</ref> Hann also fought rules footballers; but he had his nose broken, with Magee winning in three rounds.<ref name="accidents" />

In the China Open earlier that year.<ref name="cue">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/4467219.stm "Crucible Diary - Day Five"], day five of the 2005 World Championship including Hann's borrowed cue and hangover.</ref> The original cue was eventually retrieved just before the World Championship but was found to be damaged and was therefore not usable. Having borrowed a friend's cue, he decided against practising, and instead went out drinking.<ref name="cue" /> He played his first round match against Peter Ebdon hungover, and rather predictably lost the match by 10 frames to 2. When asked about the defeat to Ebdon, Hann said: "I played poorly, but to be honest, that wasn't because of the cue. I was planning to go out the night before the match, drink a couple of beers. When I found out my cue was missing, a couple of beers became a lot of beers." The fact that the first session was a morning session made it worse.

==Departure from snooker==
Hann is known in snooker for his "bad-boy" image, and in 2002 he was tried in the UK for allegedly raping a woman while both were intoxicated, but was acquitted.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2083990.stm BBC: "Snooker player cleared of rape"], article on Hann's rape allegations.
