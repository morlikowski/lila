==History==
Choudwar once served as the capital for the Somakuli Keshari Kings of Orissa. Eight prominent Siva pithas  were established by the Keshari dynasty in the vicinity of Choudwar, which are now in ruins. Tradition holds that it was the capital for Virat, the brother-in-law of Kichaka. Additionally, the five Pandava brothers, with their consort Draupadi, took shelter in Choudwar in their secret exile.

There are several schools which have been educating students according to the guidelines of the government of Orissa:

==Economy==
Some of the current and former industrial employers in the town are 
	
*Libra Carpets
*Orissa Textile Mills (OTM)
*Aviation Research Centre (ARC)
*Indian Charge Chrome Ltd (ICCL)
*Ballarpur Paper Industries Limited (BILT)

The Libra Carpets organization was functional until early the early 1990s as an EOU (Export-Oriented Unit). Plans are currently underway to revive the organization.

After being functional for more than three decades, Orissa Textile Mills had to shut down its operations owing to mishandling of company funds. It was an Orissa state government-owned company. With a work force of over 500, OTM was effective in providing clothing for much of India and it garnered several awards. Now, though production is drastically down, some officials still reside in company-provided quarters.

Spread across a wide area towards one end of the town is the ARC, where a part of the central government engages in aviation research and development activities.

With Kalinga tubes winding up its production units at Choudwar in the early 1980s, Dr. Bansidhar Panda, a prominent industrialist, had taken over the equipment to recreate the current ICCL (established in 1983) as a unit of Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys (IMFA). The Industry here is responsible for the production of Charge Chrome. At Choudwar, ICCL has an independent 108 MW coal-based Captive Power Plant unit to meet the power requirements of the two industries. ICCL sprang up as a 100% EOU and has kept with the times in achieving the requisite ISO 9001:2000 certifications. November 26 every year is celebrated as Foundation Day, which is the Birthday of the Founder chairman.ICCL has now been merged with IMFA, and the establishment is now Choudwar Division of IMFA Ltd.
