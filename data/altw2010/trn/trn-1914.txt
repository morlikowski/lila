'''L'Académie française''', or the '''French Academy''', is the pre-eminent French learned body on matters pertaining to the King Louis XIII. Suppressed in 1793 during the Napoleon Bonaparte (the Académie considers itself to have been suspended, not suppressed, during the revolution). It is the oldest of the five ''académies'' of the Institut de France.

The Académie consists of forty members, known as ''immortels'' (immortals). New members are elected by the members of the Académie itself. Académicians hold office for life, but they may be removed for misconduct. The body has the task of acting as an official authority on the language; it is charged with publishing an official dictionary of the language. Its rulings, however, are only advisory; not binding on either the public or the government. 

==History==
thumb|right|250px|Cardinal Richelieu was responsible for the establishment of the Académie française.
The Académie's origins lie in an informal group that grew out of the salons held at the Parlement de Paris on 10 July 1637. The Académie française was responsible for the regulation of French grammar, spelling, and literature. 

During the King Louis XVIII came to the throne in 1816, each class regained the title of "Académie"; accordingly, the second class of the Institut became the Académie française. Since 1816, the existence of the Académie française has been uninterrupted.

The King Louis XIV took over the function when Séguier died in 1672; since then, the French head of state has always served as the Académie's protector. From 1672 to 1805, the official meetings of the Académie were held at the Louvre; since 1805, the Académie française has met at the Collège des Quatre Nations (now known as the Palais de l'Institut). The remaining académies of the Institut de France also meet at the Palais de l'Institut.

==Membership==
The Académie française has forty seats, each of which is assigned a separate number. Candidatures are made to a seat, not to the Académie: if several seats are vacant, a candidate may apply separately for each. Since a newly elected member has to eulogise his predecessor when elected, it has happened that people refused to apply for certain seats because they disliked the predecessor too much.

Members are known as ''les immortels'' (the immortals) because of the motto, ''À l'immortalité'' ("To immortality"), that appears on the official seal of the body granted by Cardinal Richelieu. One of the ''immortels'' is chosen by his or her counterparts to be the Académie's Perpetual Secretary; the Perpetual Secretary serves for life, or until resignation. The Académie may, furthermore, appoint a former Perpetual Secretary to the office of Honorary Perpetual Secretary. The most senior member, by date of election, is the Dean of the Académie. 

New members are elected by the Académie itself (the original members were appointed). When a seat falls vacant, a person may apply to the Secretary if they wish to become a candidate. Alternatively, the existing members may nominate other candidates. A candidate is elected only if he or she receives the votes of a majority of members voting; the eulogise the member being replaced, and then listen to a speech made by one of the Academicians. Eight days thereafter, a public reception is held, during which the new member makes a speech thanking his counterparts for his election. A case happened of a member (Georges de Porto-Riche) not being received because the eulogy he made of his predecessor was not considered satisfactory by the commission of reading of the Académie, and he refused to rewrite it. Georges Clemenceau refused to be received because he feared that he might be received by his enemy Raymond Poincaré.

Members remain in the Académie for life. However, the body may expel an academician for grave misconduct. The first expulsion came in 1638, when Second World War; Vichy regime. In total, twenty members have been expelled from the Académie.

There have been a total of 710 ''immortels'', of whom four have been women (the first woman, Roman Catholic clergymen. Five French heads of state (Louis, duc de Broglie, Charles, baron de Montesquieu, Louis Pasteur, Henri Poincaré, and Voltaire.

Many notable French writers have not become members of the Académie française. In 1855, the writer Arsène Houssaye devised the expression "forty-first seat" for deserving individuals who were never elected to the Académie, either because their candidacies were rejected, because they were never candidates, or because they died before appropriate vacancies arose. Notable figures in French literature who never became academicians include Jean Jacques Rousseau,  Honoré de Balzac, René Descartes, Denis Diderot, Gustave Flaubert, Molière, Marcel Proust, Jules Verne, and Émile Zola. 

The official uniform of an academician is known as ''l'habit vert'', or the green habit. The ''habit vert'', worn at the Académie's foreign ceremonies, was first adopted during Napoleon Bonaparte's reorganisation of the Institut de France. It consists of a long black coat and black feathered cocked hat (officially called a ''bicorne''), each heavily embroidered with golden-green leaf motifs, together with black trousers or skirt. Furthermore, members receive a ceremonial sword (''l'épée''), except Academicians who are women or clergymen, who do not receive swords.

==Functions==
The Académie is France's official authority on the usages, vocabulary, and grammar of the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal power &mdash; sometimes, even governmental authorities disregard the Académie's rulings. The Académie publishes a dictionary of the French language, known as the ''Dictionnaire de l'Académie française'', which is regarded as official in France. A special Commission composed of several (but not all) of the members of the Académie undertakes the compilation of the work. The Académie has completed eight editions of the dictionary, which have been published in 1694, 1718, 1740, 1762, 1798, 1835, 1878, and 1935. It continues work on the ninth edition, of which the first volume (''A'' to ''Enzyme'') appeared in 1992, and the second volume (''Éocène'' to ''Mappemonde'') in 2000. In 1778, the Académie attempted to compile a "historical dictionary" of the French language; this idea, however, was later abandoned, the work never progressing past the letter&nbsp;''A''.

As English media,<!-- Wow, that does not represent a neutral point of view at all --> the Académie has tried to prevent the anglicisation of the French language. For example, the Académie has recommended, with mixed success, that some loanwords from English (such as ''walkman'', ''software'' and ''email'') be avoided, in favour of words derived from French (''baladeur'', ''logiciel'', and ''courriel'' respectively). Moreover, the Académie has worked to modernise French orthography. The body, however, has sometimes been criticised for behaving in an excessively conservative fashion. A recent controversy involved the  officialisation of feminine equivalents for the names of several professions. For instance, in 1997, Lionel Jospin's government began using the feminine noun "''la ministre''" to refer to a female minister, following the official practice of Canada, Belgium and Switzerland and a common, though until then unofficial, practice in France. The Académie, however, insisted on the traditional use of the masculine noun, "''le ministre''," for a minister of either gender. Use of either form remains controversial.
