Upon discovery of a shard of what could be the voiced by B-movie queen Julie Strain who is also Eastman's wife). She is described by Tyler as "a 6-foot bitch with a talking rock", the sole survivor enraged by Tyler's careless rampage. She vows to avenge her family and kill Tyler before he reaches the fountain&mdash;unaware that her sister Kerrie (Sonja Ball) is actually still alive. She is aided by a mysterious alien named Odin (Billy Idol), Zeek (a.k.a. the talking rock (who always refers to Julie as "soft one")) and reluctantly by Germaine, a former member of Tyler's highjacked crew left abandoned after he attempted to protect Kerrie, Julie's Sister.

Their search takes them to a space station that appears to be a hot bed of sleaze and depravity.  After Tyler almost rapes a waitress in a strip club, Julie intervenes and attempts to kill him.  However, Tyler uses a serum his doctor created to immediately regenerate even his most fatal injuries.  At that point, he blows up the club with grenades.

Julie then tracks Tyler to a desert planet where he discovers a war-like race of reptilian beings.  He challenges their leader to a deathmatch in which he is almost killed, and wins by throwing the leader into the lava pit, making him the reptiles' new lord.
