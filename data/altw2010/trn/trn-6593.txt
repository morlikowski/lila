thumb|ჯეი-ზი
'''შონ კარტერი''', იგივე Jigga, იგივე Jay-Z, დაიბადა და გაიზარდა ბრუკლინში. იგი იზრდებდოდა მამის გარეშე და ახლოს მეგობრობდა Notorious BIG-სთან მის გარდაცვალებამდე. 1996 წელს Jay-Z-ის შეეძლო უკვე წარედგინა პირველი ალბომი, მაგრამ არც თუ ადვილი გამოდგა გამოენახა საერთო ენა რეპ-ლეიბლებთან. საბოლოოდ ჯიგამ და მისმა მეგობრებმა: დეიმონ დაშმა და კარიმ „Biggs“ ბურკმა მიიღეს თამამი და სარისკო გადაწყვეტილება:გაეკეთებინათ საკუთარი სტუდია. ამგვარად ჩამოყალიბდა RoC-A-Fella Records. ამის შემდეგ სამეულმა ბაზარზე გამოუშვა Jay-Z-ს სადებიუტო ალბომი „Reasonable Doubt“, რომელმაც ყოველგვარ მოლოდინს გადააჭარბა:პლატინა და მესამე ადგილი ტოპ 200 ჟურნალ ბილბორდში. ასევე ეს ალბომი აღიარეს მსოფლიო ჰიპ-ჰოპის კლასიკად.

მეორე ალბომი „In My Lifetime, Vol.1“ გაცილებით უფრო წარმატებული აღმოჩნდა კომერციული თვალსაზრისით. ჯიგა სახელს იხვეჭს, იგი მილიონიბით ადამიანის ყურადღაბის იქცევს. შემდეგი ალბომი „Vol.2: Hard Knock Life“ჯიგასთვის ბევრად უფრო წარმატებული აღმოჩნდა პირველი ადგილი ჰიტ-პარად ბილბოარდში და 5 მილიონზე მეტი ამ ალბომის გაყიდვა დაწყებული 1998 წლიდან, მას სუპერვარსკლავის სახელს უხვეჭს.
შემდეგ ალბომში „Vol.3: Life and Times of S.Carter“ Jay-Z აღწერს თავის ცხოვრებას:სიგარების მოწევა 100 დოლარიანი კუპიურებეს მოკიდებით, კოლექციური ღვინოები, ძვირად ღირებული ქალები და ა. შ. ამ ალბომში მონაწილეობას იღებენ ისეთი ვარსკლავები როგორიცაა Dr.Dre,Mariah Carey და Beanie Sigel.
როკაფელას უფროსობა პუბლიკას თავისი არტისტების ახალ ალბომებს სთავაზობს რომელთა შორისაცააა: Beanie Sigel, Memphis Bleek და Amil.დეიმონ დაშის და ჯეიზის ყურადღაბას იქცევს მაშინ არც თუ პოპულარული პროდუსერები :Neptunes, Just Blaze და Kanye West.
როკაფელას ოჯახმა კიდევ ერთი დარტყმა განახორციელა. გამოვიდა ჯეიზის მორიგი ალბომი Dynasty Roc la Familia, რომელმაც ერთ კვირაში თითქმის ოქროს სტატუსს მიაღწია. მაგრამ ეს წარმატება არავის აღარ უკვირდა. დგებოდა მომავალი წელი ე. ი. ჯეიზის მორიგი ალბომი.
გავიდა წელი და Jay-Z-მ მორიგი ალბომი „Blueprint“ გამოსცა, რომელიც ყოველნაირად წააგავდა მის პირველ ნამუშევარს „REASONABLE DOUBT-ს“. „დიახ, მე დავუბრუნდი ჩემს ფესვებს ხალხო და რატომაც არ შეიძენთ ამ ალბომს“-მიმართა ჯეიზიმ ხალხს. დიახ იგი მართლა გავდა მის პირველ ალბომს მაგრამ მან უფრო დიდი სახელი მოიხვეჭა. ტრეკებმა „Girls, Girls, Girls“, „Izzo (H. O.V. A.)“ 24 საათი რადიოებსა და ტელევიზიებში ტრიალებდა. ასევე ამ ალბომში შედიოდა დაუვიწყარი „Takeover“ სადაც იგი NAS-ს არც თუ კარკად მოიხსენიებს. ამ ომის მიზეზი იყო თუ ვინ არის ბრუკლინში მთავრი. Takeover-ს მოჰყვა ასევე NAS-ის ტრეკი სადაც Jay-Z-ის ცუდად მოიხსენიებს. საბოლოოდ Jay-Z უფრო ძლიერი აღმოჩნდა და მან 2-1 გაიმარჯვა. ეს პატარა რეპ ომის მაგვარი რაღაცა ხვევნა-კოცნით დამთავრდა. საბოლოოდ NAS-მა გადააკეთა თავისი ბიფი და შეცვალა ჯეიზის საქებარი სიტყვებით.
ამის შემდეგ Jay-Z-მ ნამდვილი ალბომი თუ სასწაული გამოსცა. ალბომი სახელად „Blueprint2: The Gift And the Curse“ რომელიც 2 დისკად იყო გაყოფილი და შედიოდა 25 ტრეკი(110 წუთი!!!).
ჯეიზიმ „The Black Album“-ის გამოშვების შემდეგ ყველას თავზარი დასცა. მან განაცხადა, რომ სცენას თავს ანებებს. მაგრამ ამ ალბომის შემდეგ მან ჯერ R.KELLY-სთან, ხოლო შემდეგ LINKIN PARK-თან გამოუშვა ალბომები.
Jay-Z დღესდღეობით ერთ-ერთი ყველაზე წარმატებული და პოპულარული ადამიანია მსოფლიოში. იგი ერთ-ერთი ყველაზე უზარმაზარი და წარმატებული რეპ ლეიბლის, def jam-ის, პრეზიდენტია. ეს ის ლეიბლია რომელმაც არ მიიღო მისი სადებიუტო ალბომი. მას აქვს ასევე ფეხსაცმლის თავისი ხაზი(rebook-თან ერთად), ელიტალური კლუბების პრეზიდენტია და ასევე მან შეიძინა NBA -ს გუნდი NEW JERSEY NETS-ი.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Originally from Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of AZ, until it was closed down. After that he attended George Westinghouse Information Technology High School in Downtown Brooklyn, with fellow rappers The Notorious B.I.G. and Busta Rhymes, and Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey, but did not graduate.<ref>[http://www.celebritywonder.com/html/jay-z.html Jay-Z Picture, Profile, Gossip, and News at CelebrityWonder.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He claims to have been caught up in selling drugs, to which he refers in his music.<ref name="aboutjayz"/>

According to his mother Gloria Carter, a young Jay-Z used to wake his siblings up at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table. Eventually, she bought him a DMX. On top of that, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony member Bizzy Bone was snatched by his employer and taken to New York to battle Jay, Bizzy reportedly was victorious in the battle .

In his neighborhood, Carter was known as "Jazzy", a nickname that eventually developed into his stage name, "Jay-Z". The moniker is also a homage to his musical mentor J/Z subway lines that have a stop at Marcy Avenue in Brooklyn.<ref name="allmusicbio"/>

Jay-Z can be heard on several of Jaz-O's early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including "The Originators" and "Hawaiian Sophie".  He also collaborated with DMX Q-Man and Ja Rule and Shazim Hasan in 1995. His first official rap single was called "I Can't Get With That" which he also released a music video for.

==Music career==
===''Reasonable Doubt'' (1996)===

From the beginning of his professional recording career, when no major label gave him a record deal, Priority to distribute his material, Jay-Z released his 1996 debut album ''Clark Kent and a notable appearance by ''Billboard'' 200, the album was a critical success.<ref name="allmusicbio"/>

===''In My Lifetime, Vol. 1'' (1997)===

After reaching a new distribution deal with Def Jam in 1997, Jay-Z released his follow-up ''Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs, it sold better than his previous effort. Jay-Z later explained that the album was made during one of the worst periods of his life.  He was reeling from the death of his close friend Ski. Jay-Z mentioned on the CenterStage'' show that if he could do one thing in his career over, it would be ''Vol. 1'', claiming that "it [the cd] was ''this'' close to being a classic, but I put like, a few songs on there that ruined it."  Two examples of what he was referring to are "I Know What Girls Like" and "Bad Boy beatmakers and criticized as a commercialization of his sound.  Like its predecessor, ''In My Lifetime, Vol. 1'' also earned Platinum status in the United States.

===''Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life'' (1998)===

1998's ''Nigga What, Nigga Who" which featured Amil too. ''Vol. 2'' would eventually become Jay-Z's most commercially successful album; it was certified 5x platinum in the United States and has to date sold over 8 million worldwide. The album went on to win a Grammy Award, although Jay-Z boycotted the ceremony protesting DMX's failure to garner a Grammy nomination.

===''Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter'' (1999)===

In 1999, Jay-Z released ''Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter''. Despite continued criticism for his increasingly pop-oriented sound,<ref>[http://www.thejayztour.com/biography.html Jay-Z biography.]</ref> the album proved to be successful and went platinum three times and sold over 5.6 million records worldwide. Through his lyricism, he was able to retain respect from some of his die-hard fans. ''Vol. 3'' is remembered for its smash hit, "Big Pimpin'" (feat. UGK). By this time, Jay-Z was seen as a hip-hop figurehead both by hardcore fans and by the hip-hop industry due to his lyrics and his high album sales. 

===''The Dynasty: Roc La Familia'' (2000)===

The subject of much criticism, praise, popularity, condemnation, and discussion, Jay-Z decided to begin developing other artists.  Around 2000, he and Damon Dash signed various artists (including "Dynasty" members Amil, Beanie Sigel and Memphis Bleek) and began introducing them to the public. He next appeared on ''The Dynasty: Roc La Familia'', which was intended as a compilation album to introduce these new artists, though the album had Jay-Z's name on it to strengthen market recognition and by extension, sales. This strategy worked to an extent - ''The Dynasty: Roc La Familia'' sold over 2 million units in the U.S. alone.

===''The Blueprint'' (2001)===

2001's ''The Source'' magazine. Released on terrorist attacks that same day. ''The Blueprint'' was applauded for its production and the balance of "mainstream" and "hardcore" rap, receiving recognition from both audiences. Prodigy of meager album sales and her weight gain.

===''The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse'' (2002)===

Jay-Z's next solo album was 2002's 4 million (U.S. only) selling ''The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse'', a double-album. It was later reissued in a single-disc version, ''The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse'', such as "Stop", "La La La (Excuse Me Again)", "What They Gonna Do, Part II" and "Beware" produced by and featuring Panjabi MC.<!--The first, second, and fourth songs listed here don't appear in the track listing of the The Blueprint 2.1 article.-->

===Rivalry with Nas===

Tension between the two supposedly dates as far back as 1996, when Nas refused to make a guest appearance on Jay-Z's debut album ''Reasonable Doubt''. However, the relationship between the two rappers remained peaceful (Jay-Z even giving a shoutout to Nas in his album liner notes),<ref></ref> and the tension did not escalate to full-blown rivalry until after the death of the Notorious B.I.G. The position of favorite rapper in New York seemed vacant after the death of Biggie, and fans were eager to see who would take over.

The dispute involved many of the rappers, especially associates at Def Jam (of which Jay-Z was president and CEO), he also featured on Nas's first Def Jam album - "Hip Hop Is Dead" where he does a song with Nas called "Black Republican." The rivalry also impacted their careers critically and commercially. The battle was significant in that it revived the trend of using 'beefs' as a source for publicity and promotion for hip hop artists, originally unpopular following the tragic deaths of Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., now prevalent within the hip hop community.

===''The Black Album'' (2003)===

Jay-Z toured with The Black Album''. He worked with several producers including Ether" and other detractors, as Jay-Z raps, "I'm not a biter I'm a writer for myself and others/I say a Big verse I'm only biggin' up my brother."  During that same year, Jay-Z supplied new rhymes on a remix of The Black Album has sold 3 million copies in the US.

In 2004, there was a runaway hit Black Album'' vocals were blended with instrumentals sampled exclusively from White Album'' (which subsequently embroiled the DJ in a lawsuit that was later dropped with EMI, the owners of the Beatles' work). This was made possible by an a cappella version of the "Black Album" that Jay-Z released with the specific intent for others to mix. The success of ''The Grey Album'' led to a rainbow of ''Black Album'' remix projects including ''The Red Album'', ''The Blue Album'' and so forth.

===''Collision Course'' (2004)===

Also in 2004, Jay-Z collaborated with rock group Collision Course, and contained a six track EP, as well as a ''making of'' DVD. Some of the mash ups tracks were entitled "Dirt Off Your Shoulder/Lying From You", "Jigga What/Faint", and "Numb/Encore". "Numb/Encore" went on to win a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, and was also performed with Linkin Park live at the Grammys, with a special appearance by Paul McCartney, who added verses from his song ''Yesterday''. The EP sold over two million copies in the US alone.

===Retirement===
On Fade to Black''. This concert was his "retirement party". All proceeds went to charity. Other performers included collaborators like Foxy Brown, Pharrell and R. Kelly with special appearances by Voletta Wallace and Afeni Shakur; the mothers of The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur respectively.

While Jay-Z had attested to a retirement from making new studio albums, various side projects and appearances soon followed.  Included in these were a greatest hits record, mash-up projects and concert appearances with R. Kelly, Linkin Park and Phish.

Jay-Z was the executive producer of Fort Minor's debut album ''The Rising Tied''. Mike Shinoda got together with Jay-Z himself, as well as his Linkin Park bandmate Brad Delson, and they went over what tracks they thought should make the album.

==="I Declare War" concert===
Having been such a visible artist in the late 1990s through the early 2000s, Jay-Z has been the subject of more rap-related controversy than most artists in mainstream hip-hop. Some of these have been resolved, some are ongoing, and some have simply dissipated. 

On The Game and Cam'ron never materialized. 

The theme of the concert was Jay-Z's position as President and CEO of Def Jam, complete with an on-stage mock-up of the  Diddy.

At the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many arguments to rest to the surprise of hip-hop fans. Instead of declaring war, he declared that he was the "United Nations of this rap shit". The most significant development in this show was closure to the infamous hip hop rivalry between Jay-Z and Nas. The two former rivals shook hands and shared the stage together to perform Jay-Z's "Dead Presidents" blended with Nas's song "The World is Yours" from which "Dead Presidents" had sampled the vocals on the chorus. Nas's verses were rapped over the "Dead Presidents" beat in the vein of a mix song done by DJ Statik Selektah. Nas also performed songs of his own later in the show.

Disagreements between other artists were also brought to a close (or put on hold) at the Powerhouse show. The event brought together for the first time in years, Diddy and The LOX, both having had a long-standing animosity due to a contract agreement and the latter's departure from Bad Boy Entertainment. Shortly after the concert, the altercation was fully rectified.

The event also saw the return of Beanie Sigel from incarceration. There had been some speculation that Beanie Sigel was going to depart from Roc-A-Fella Records, but this concert proved otherwise. Beanie and The LOX's Jadakiss also officially ended their own argument when they, Jay-Z, the rest of the LOX and Sauce Money (who had been thought to have some animosity towards Jay-Z, but this was also untrue) all performed the song "Reservoir Dogs".

===''Kingdom Come'' (2006)===

Jay-Z returned with his comeback album on Kingdom Come''.<ref></ref> Jay-Z's comeback single, "Friday'', ''The Italian Job''). The album features producers such as Just Blaze, Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, Dr. Dre and Coldplay's Chris Martin (single entitled "Beach Chair").<ref name="sfgate"></ref><ref name="mtvnews"></ref>
This album has already sold 2 million copies in the U.S. alone. Jay-Z made a guest appearance on the Fall Out Boy album Infinity On High.
In June 2007, Jay-Z got number one song on the Umbrella with Rihanna becoming his first number one since Crazy in Love with Beyoncé.
Umbrella was at #1 for 7 weeks on the Hot 100.
Jay-Z appeared on rapper T.I.'s album T.I. vs. T.I.P. on the song "Watch What You Say to Me".

===''American Gangster'' (2007)===

Jay-Z released his tenth album entitled ''American Gangster'' on film, he was heavily inspired to create a new "concept" album that depicts his experiences as a street-hustler.<ref name="newyorktimes"></ref> 
This album will not be the film's official soundtrack, even though it will be distributed by Def Jam.<ref name="hiphopdx"></ref>
According to the XXL Magazine, which features Jay-Z on the cover, he gave further detail into "American Gangster." Jay-Z's "American Gangster" depicts his life in correlation to the movie American Gangster. Jay-Z reports:

<blockquote>"When I saw the movie, the way Denzel portrayed the character, you know, we never seen a black guy ascend this high in a movie before, to being over the mob. So immediately that struck with me. Like, the success of it all. [...] I took that emotion and pulled it into my song. So it's my own movie. I call it an indie film now – that's my new shit. It's the indie-film version of American Gangster."</blockquote> 

At the start of the album's first single, "Blue Magic," Jay-Z offers a dealer's manifesto while making references to political figures of the late 1980s with the lyric: "Blame Reagan for making me to into a monster, blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra, I ran contraband that they sponsored, before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert.<ref>[http://media.www.jhunewsletter.com/media/storage/paper932/news/2007/11/15/ArtsEntertainment/New-Vibrations-3105603.shtml  Johns Hopkins Newsletter: New Vibrations]</ref>"  Also notable about the "Blue Magic" music video was Jay-Z flashing 500 euro notes, in what Harvard Business School professor Rawi Abdelal has called a "turning point in American pop culture's response to globalization".
