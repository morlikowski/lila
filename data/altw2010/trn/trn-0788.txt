Termin '''kryminologia''' pochodzi od łacińskiego słowa ''crimen'' (przestępstwo) oraz greckiego ''logos'' (nauka).
'''Kryminologia''' zajmuje się osobą sprawcy przestępstwa, przyczynami jego czynu i warunkami społecznymi, w jakich go dokonał.

Za twórcę kryminologii uważa się włoskiego lekarza, antropologiczną zakładającą istnienie "przestępcy z urodzenia" . C. Lombroso zawzięcie odwiedzał znane więzienia, by wnikliwie obserwując twarze, sylwetki i dłonie aresztantów, stworzyć wykaz fizycznych cech wspólnych łączących kryminalistów. W wyniku prowadzonych badań doszedł on do wniosku, że na podstawie wyglądu można rozpoznać potencjalnego i rzeczywistego przestępcę. Stworzony przez niego wzorzec przestępcy stosowano ze zmiennym powodzeniem do początku lat dwudziestych XX w. Według Lombroso twarz przestępcy charakteryzują silnie zarysowane łuki brwiowe, kości policzkowe, brak delikatnych rysów nosa i ust, twarz brzydka, budząca odrazę, czoło cofnięte (jak u neandertalczyka), silna budowa kośćca itp. 

Kryminologia – to nauka społeczna zajmująca się badaniem i gromadzeniem całościowej wiedzy na temat przestępstwa jako pewnej szczególnej formy zachowania dewiacyjnego, przestępczości jako pewnego zjawiska społecznego, a także osoby sprawcy przestępstwa jak również ofiary przestępstwa, a także instytucji i mechanizmów kontrolnych, jakie tworzą społeczeństwa w celu zapobiegania i zwalczania przestępczości (Błachut, Gaberle, Krajewski).

Współczesna '''kryminologia''' bazuje na naukach takich, jak nieodróżnianie dobra od zła i in.) oraz zewnętrzne (brak środków do życia, wyobcowanie ze środowiska i próba powrotu do niego z jakimś efektownym czynem - młodzież, frustracja sytuacją własną lub bliskich, społeczne przyzwolenie otoczenia na czyn zabroniony jakiejś subkulturowej grupy itp.).

W ustaleniu kryminologicznego obrazu sprawcy pomocna jest także kryminalistyka, technika śledcza.

'''Criminology''' is the social-scientific study of sociologists and psychologists, as well as on writings in law. An important way to analyze data is to look at quantitative methods in criminology.  In 1885, Italian law professor Raffaele Garofalo coined the term "criminology" (in Italian, ''criminologia'').  The French anthropologist Paul Topinard used it for the first time in French (''criminologie'') around the same time.<ref></ref>

==Schools of thought==
In the mid-18th century, criminology arose as social philosophers gave thought to crime and concepts of law. Over time, several schools of thought have developed.

===Classical school===
The Classical School, which developed in the mid 18th century, was based on utilitarian philosophy.  On Crimes and Punishments'' (1763-64), legal reforms, the legal system in the United States.

===Positivist school===
The Positivist School presumes that criminal behaviour is caused by internal and external factors outside of the individual's control. The scientific method was introduced and applied to study human behavior.  Positivism can be broken up into three segments which include biological, psychological and social positivism.

atavistic" criminal tendencies. This approach, influenced by the earlier theory of phrenology and by Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution, has been superseded.  Enrico Ferri, a student of Lombroso, believed that social as well as biological factors played a role, and held the view that criminals should not be held responsible for the factors causing their criminality were beyond their control.  Criminologists have since rejected Lombroso's biological theories, with control groups not used in his studies.<ref name="siegel-p139"></ref>  

Lombroso's Italian school was rivalled, in France, by organicist position <ref name=Renneville/>. Furthermore, Lacassagne criticized the lack of efficiency of recidivists") for example by supporting the 1895 law on penal colonies or opposing the abolition of death penalty in 1906 <ref name=Renneville/>. 

Robert Hare. He also based his model on early parental B. F. Skinner (1938), Albert Bandura (1973), and the topic of "nature vs. nurture".) 

Sociological positivism postulates that societal factors such as statistical analysis to gain insight into relationship between sociological factors.  He found that age, gender, poverty, education, and alcohol consumption were important factors related to crime.<ref></ref>  
Rawson W. Rawson utilized ethnographic approach to address social questions and poverty, and presented his studies in ''London Labour and the London Poor''.<ref></ref>  Emile Durkheim viewed crime as an inevitable aspect of society, with uneven distribution of wealth and other differences among people.

===Chicago School===
The Chicago School arose in the early twentieth century, through the work of Robert Ezra Park, urban sociologists at concentric zones that often exist as cities grow, including the "zone in transition" which was identified as most volatile and subject to disorder.  In the 1940s, Henry McKay and Clifford R. Shaw focused on juvenile delinquents, finding that they were concentrated in the zone of transition.  

Chicago School sociologists adopted a social ecology approach to studying cities, and postulated that urban neighborhoods with high levels of poverty often experience breakdown in the social structure and institutions such as family and schools.  This results in social disorganization, which reduces the ability of these institutions to control behavior and creates an environment ripe for deviant behavior.

Other researchers suggested an added social-psychological link.  Edwin Sutherland suggested that people learn criminal behavior from older, more experienced criminals that they may associate with.

==Theories of crime==
Theoretical perspectives used in criminology include functionalism, interactionism, Marxism, econometrics, systems theory, postmodernism, etc.

===Social structure theories===
====Social disorganization (neighborhoods)====
heterogeneity.<ref name="bursik-1988"/> With high turnover, informal social structure often fails to develop, which in turn makes it difficult to maintain social order in a community.

====Social ecology====
Since the 1970s, social ecology studies have built on the social disorganization theories.  Many studies have found that crime rates are associated with poverty, disorder, high numbers of abandoned buildings, and other signs of community deterioration.<ref name="bursik-1988"/><ref></ref>  As working and middle class people leave deteriorating neighborhoods, the most disadvantaged portions of the population may remain.  William Julius Wilson suggested a poverty "concentration effect", which may cause neighborhoods to be isolated from the mainstream of society and become prone to violence.

====Strain theory (social class)====
Strain theory, (also known as Mertonian Anomie), advanced by American sociologist Robert Merton, suggests that mainstream Durkheim.  Merton saw the term as meaning a deviant subcultures (gang members, "hobos": urban homeless drunks and drug abusers).<ref></ref>

====Subcultural theory====

Following on from the Chicago School and Strain Theory, and also drawing on Edwin H. Sutherland's idea of differential association, subcultural theorists focused on small cultural groups fragmenting away from the mainstream to form their own values and meanings about life. 

Freud's social norms of the middle class.<ref></ref>  Some youth, especially from poorer areas where opportunities are scarce, might adopt social norms specific to those places which may include "toughness" and disrespect for authority.  Criminal acts may result when youths conform to norms of the deviant subculture.<ref></ref>

Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin suggested that delinquency can result from differential opportunity for lower class youth.<ref name="cloward"></ref>  Such youths may be tempted to take up criminal activities, choosing an illegitimate path that provides them more lucrative economic benefits than conventional, over legal options such as minimum wage-paying jobs available to them.<ref name="cloward"/> 

British subcultural theorists focused more heavily on the issue of class, where some criminal activities were seen as 'imaginary solutions' to the problem of belonging to a subordinate class. A further study by the Chicago school looked at gangs and the influence of the interaction of gang leaders under the observation of adults.

===Individual theories===
====Trait theories====

Biosocial and psychological trait theories have emerged in modern criminology, as scientific knowledge of aggressive behavior, and possible influence of Environmental contamination, particularly lead levels, and links to aggressive behavior is another research focus of biosocial theorists.

At the other side of the spectrum, criminologist Lonnie Athens developed a theory about how a process of brutalization by parents or peers that usually occurs in childhood results in violent crimes in adulthood. Richard Rhodes' ''Why They Kill'' describes Athens' observations about domestic and societal violence in the criminals' backgrounds. Both Athens and Rhodes reject the genetic inheritance theories.<ref>{{cite book
