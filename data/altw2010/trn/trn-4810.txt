'''''Il signore e la signora Smith''''' è un film diretto dal regista Alfred Hitchcock.

==Trama==

David (Robert Montgomery) e Ann Smith (Carole Lombard) sono sposati felicemente da circa tre anni. Lui è un avvocato e lei un'intelligente ed indipendente giovane donna. I due coniugi hanno un sistema particolare per risolvere le crisi familiari: seguendo scrupolosamente un rigido decalogo (che prevede, per esempio, che nessuno dei due si allontani da casa dopo un litigio, anzi, che marito e moglie si isolino dal resto del mondo e cerchino di risolvere insieme i loro problemi) affrontano le crisi e le superano brillantemente. A seguito di una di queste "terapie", che si era dilungata per qualche giorno, David Smith torna in ufficio, dove riceve la visita di un notaio (che in seguito incontra anche Ann). L'uomo gli rivela che, a causa di un vizio di forma, il loro matrimonio non è più valido e che quindi dovrebbero celebrarlo di nuovo.

==Plot==
Ann Smith (Carole Lombard) and her lawyer husband David (Robert Montgomery) discover that they are not actually married. This gives them second thoughts as to whether they should stay together or not. Gene Raymond stars as a friend and colleague of David who begins to woo Ann.

Ann and David Smith are a happily married couple living in New York. One morning, Ann asks David if he had to do it over again, would he marry her? To her shock, he answers he wouldn't. Later that day, they both separately find out that, due to a complication when they married three years ago, they are in fact not legally married. Ann does not mention this to David, and thinks he will remarry her that very night after he takes her out to a romantic dinner. When this does not happen, she angrily kicks David out of their home.
David spends the night at his club, where a friend advises him to just wait a day, and then come back home. But when David drops by after work, Ann announces behind a closed door that she is not married to David, and has no intention of ever marrying him.

An angry and dishearted David takes to following Ann around, in the process interrupting a date and getting her fired from her job. A friend and co-worker of David, Jeff, played by Gene Raymond, tells David he will talk to Ann and persuade her to remarry David. But when David shows up later that evening, he finds that Jeff has instead arranged a date with Ann the following night. David arranges a blind date at the same restaurant, but his date is vulgar and rude. In the end, he makes a total fool of himself – and in front of Ann, no less! 
Later, Ann and Jeff go to the world fair, but become stuck on a ride and are forced to sit through several hours of rain many feet up in the air.

Ann and Jeff begin to date seriously, and Ann even meets Jeff's parents, an affair that quickly becomes awkward when David barges in. To escape, Ann and Jeff decide to take a vacation with Jeff's parents at a skiing resort – the same that Ann and David had earlier been planning to holiday at. Upon arriving at the resort, they find that David has rented a cabin right next to them, but when confronted, David simply faints. David spends the next few hours pretending to be sick and delirious whilst Ann fawns over him, but when Ann finds him out, she yells at him and leaves. Ann then loudly stages a one-way pretend conversation with Jeff in order for David to see they are very serious about each other. This falls through when David storms in to find her talking to thin air. In the end, Ann and David, once the picture of a happy couple, are screaming bloody murder at each other when Jeff walks in. Ann then attacks Jeff for not beating up David, and Jeff and his parents leave in a huff.

Ann, alone at last, struggles with her skis until David offers to help her, then lifts up her legs so that she cannot get up. When Ann yells at him, he just bends down and kisses her, silencing her rants.
