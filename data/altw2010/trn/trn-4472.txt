'''Ingel''' on ladinakeelsest sõnast ''angelus'', mis tuleneb omakorda kreekakeelsest sõnast ''&#7940;&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;'' [angelos], mis tähendab sõnumitooja, saadik (kirjutatuna "gg" hääldatakse kreeka keeles nagu "ng"). Heebrea keeles lähim sõna ingli kohta on ''&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498;'' [mal'ach], mis tähendab samuti sõnumitoojat.

An '''Angel''' is a transcendental being found in many religions.  Although the nature of angels and the tasks given to them vary from tradition to tradition, in Christianity, Judaism and Islam, they typically act as messengers from God.  Other roles in religious traditions include acting as warrior or guard; the concept of a "guardian angel" is popular in modern Western culture.  Angels are usually viewed as emanations of a supreme divine being, sent to do the tasks of that being.  Traditions vary as to whether angels have free will or are merely extensions of the supreme being's will.  While the appearance of angels also varies, many views of angels give them a human shape.

==Etymology==
The word "angel" in English (from Old English and German ''Engel''), French (from Old French ''angele''), Spanish, and many other Romance languages are derived from the Latin ''angelus'', itself derived from  Koine Greek: άγγελος, ''angelos'', "messenger" (pl. άγγελοι).<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=angel&searchmode=none angel in Online Etymological Dictionary</ref> The ultimate etymology of that word in Greek is uncertain.<ref>Frisk, Griechisches Etymologisches Woerterbuch "Da das ganz unsicher ist, bleibt diese Etymologie sehr fraglich." [http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=leiden&morpho=0&basename=\data\ie\frisk&first=101]</ref>

In Hebrew & Arabic the primary term for "angel" is "''מַלְאָךְ), "''malaika''", or "''consonantal root l-'-k (ל-א-ך), meaning "to send."  This root is attested in Hebrew only in this noun and in the noun "Melakha" (מְלָאכָה), meaning "work".  Other words referring to angels include כרוב ''kruv''<ref>p.664, Jastrow</ref> describing young children, from which the English word "cherub" is derived.  Another Hebrew term is ''Gil-Gulim,'' meaning "revolving," and angels are sometimes depicted as wheels with wings.  Derived from this is the Hebrew term "Gal-Gal," "the rotation of fortune, change."<ref>Bava Batra 16b</ref>

==Judaic beliefs==
The Bible, Oral Law, Merkabah tradition. Jewish angelology is far from systematic, and the purpose, nature and personalities of individual angels and the heavenly host as a whole varies greatly across historical eras, texts, genres and traditions.<ref name = "jpmmbk">[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1521&letter=A&search=angels|The Jewish Encyclopedia, accessed Feb. 15, 2008]</ref>

The Bible uses the terms מלאך אלהים (<i>melakh Elohim</i>; messenger of God), מלאך יהוה (<i>melakh Adonai</i>; messenger of the Lord), בני אלוהים (<i>b'nai Elohim</i>; sons of God) and הקודשים (<i>ha-qodeshim</i>; the holy ones) to refer to beings traditionally interpreted as angels. Other terms are used in later texts, such as העוליונים (the upper ones). Daniel is the first biblical figure to refer to individual angels by name.<ref name = "jpmmbk"/>

In post-Biblical Judaism, certain angels came to take on a particular significance and developed unique personalities and roles. Though these Kabbalist mysticism and often serves as a scribe. He is briefly mentioned in the Talmud,<ref>Sanhedrin 38b and Avodah Zerah 3b.</ref> and figures prominently in Merkabah mystical texts. Michael, who serves as a warrior and advocate for Israel () is looked upon particularly fondly. Gabriel is mentioned in the Book of Daniel () and briefly in the Talmud,<ref>cf. Sanhedrin 95b</ref> as well as many Merkabah mystical texts.  

===Maimonides and rationalism===

In the rationalist view of angels that is accepted by many Jews.

The rationalist view of angels, as held by Maimonides, Gersonides, Samuel Ibn Tibbon, etc., states that God's actions are never mediated by a violation of the laws of nature. Rather, all such interactions are by way of angels. Even this can be highly misleading: Maimonides harshly states that the average person's understanding of the term "angel" is ignorant in the extreme.

Rather, according to Maimonides, the wise man understands that what the Bible and Talmud refer to as "angels" are actually metaphors for laws of nature, or the principles by which the universe operates. This is explained in his ''Guide of the Perplexed'' II:4 and II:6, and differs from the more widespread perception of angels in the Torah.

==Zoroastrianism==

In Zoroastrianism there are different angel-like animals. For example, each person has one guardian angel, called Fravashi. They patronize human beings and other creatures, and also manifest God’s energy. The Amesha Spentas have often been regarded as angels, although they don't convey messages,<ref name = "AZ">Lewis, James R., Oliver, Evelyn Dorothy, Sisung Kelle S. (Editor) (1996), ''Angels A to Z'', Entry: '''Zoroastrianism''', pp. 425-427, Visible Ink Press, ISBN 0-7876-0652-9</ref> but are rather emanations of Ahura Mazda ("Wise Lord", God); they initially appear in an abstract fashion and then later became personalized, associated with diverse aspects of the divine creation.<ref>Darmesteter, James (1880)(translator), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe04/sbe0405.htm ''The Zend Avesta, Part I]: Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 4'', pp. lx-lxxii, Oxford University Press, 1880, at [http://www.sacred-texts.com sacred-texts.com]</ref>

==Latter-day Saint beliefs==

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (generally called "Mormons") views angels as the messengers of God sent to mankind to deliver messages, minister to humanity, teach doctrines of salvation, call mankind to repentance, give priesthood keys, save individuals in perilous times, and guide mankind.<ref name="Mormon Doctrine"> page 36. , Deseret (1966) God's messengers, those individuals whom he sends (often from his personal presence in the eternal worlds), to deliver his messages (Luke 1:11-38); to minister to his children (Acts 10:1-8, 30-32); to teach them the doctrines of salvation (Mosiah 3); to call them to repentance (Moro. 7:31); to give them priesthood and keys (D. & C. 13; 128:20-21); to save them in perilous circumstances (1 Ne. 3:29-31; Dan. 6:22); to guide them in the performance of his work (Gen. 24: 7); to gather his elect in the last days (Matt. 24:31); to perform all needful things relative to his work (Moro. 7:29-33) — such messengers are called angels.</ref>

Joseph Smith, Jr. described his first alleged angelic encounter thus ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_h/1/31-33#31 Joseph Smith History 1:30-33]):

<blockquote>
"While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.

"He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and neck were also bare. I could discover that he had no other clothing on but this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his bosom.

"Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked upon him, I was afraid; but the fear soon left me."
</blockquote>

People who claimed to have received a visit by an angel include Martin Harris. Although Cowdery, Whitmer, and Harris all eventually became disaffected with Smith and left the church, none of them retracted their statement that they had seen and conversed with an angel of the Lord, and indeed, even defended their claim of angelic visitation to their deaths.  Countless other Latter-day Saints, both in the early movement and modern church, claimed or have claimed to have seen angels.

The majority of the angelic visitations in the early Moroni, the Book of Mormon prophet Peter, James, and John.  Later, at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery claimed to have been visited by Jesus, and subsequently by Moses, Elias, and Elijah (see [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/110/ D&C 110]).

Latter-day Saints also believe that Michael the Archangel was Adam (the first man) when he was mortal, and that Gabriel lived on the earth as Noah.

==Other religions==
The Etruscans depicted winged beings - benevolent psychopompian personal guardians with wings- called "Vanths."

Angel-like beings called  Tenshi appear in Japanese mythology.

There are a number of books describing encounters with angels or angel-like beings.

===Bahá'í===
An angel, often termed a "Maiden of Heaven", also appears in Bahá'í literature. Bahá'ís generally see her as a symbol of the holy spirit, the spirit of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation, or even as his "higher self". Bahá'u'lláh taught that his ministry began when he was visited by a Maiden of Heaven while incarcerated in a dungeon of Tehran. While always depicted as desirable and attractive, she also appears as a transcendent spiritual figure, and sexual desire is understood to be a metaphor for spiritual longing. While other angels appear in Bahá'u'lláh's works, they are generally depicted as the personification of a divine virtue, such as trustworthiness.

'Abdu'l-Bahá also defined angels as "those holy souls who have severed attachment to the earthly world, who are free from the fetters of self and passion and who have attached their hearts to the divine realm and the merciful kingdom".<ref></ref>

Furthermore, he said that people can be angels in this world:

<blockquote>"Ye are the angels, if your feet be firm, your spirits rejoiced, your secret thoughts pure, your eyes consoled, your ears opened, your breasts dilated with joy, and your souls gladdened, and if you arise to assist the Covenant, to resist dissension and to be attracted to the Effulgence!"<ref></ref></blockquote>

===Hinduism===

Hinduism also acknowledges the existence of higher world angelic beings. The Sanskrit word used is deva ('being of light'). Devas reside in the higher Antarloka, or the astral plane, and are usually the astral forms of people who are dead, and presently in between births. In other words, devas are the spirits of those who have passed, and reside in the Antarloka (also known as the Devaloka), until they either take on another physical body or ascend to higher worlds. The devas, or angels, are not so much worshiped, but looked at as inner-plane helpers, guiding each person along throughout life. Each person is said to have many, as many as thousands, looking after them. Incidentally, the Antarloka is also the realm throughout which we travel and stay during our sleeping hours.

Hindu scriptures and sages tell us that the entire purpose of devas' involvement with us, is to help both us and them evolve spiritually. It is the inner-plane duty of these beings of light to help unfold and work out the karma of people living in physical bodies. Many Hindus view the devas as very real beings, not mere symbols or concepts.
