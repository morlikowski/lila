'''Эфе́с''' (, , ) — древний Малой Азии, при впадении реки Каистр (совр. Турции). В настоящее время археологическая зона Эфеса, размером более десяти километров, находится в окрестности города Сельчук, Турция. В музее Сельчука собраны уникальные находки из эфесских храмов.

Город был заложен на берегу Эгейского моря, тем самым, был торговли. После землетрясения море отошло, опустившись на 57 км от берега моря.

Своей славой Эфес в большой степени обязан местному Артемидою. Поклонение богине идет с незапамятных времен, но строительство посвященного ей храма, одного из семи чудес света, началось в первой половине VI в. до н. э..

Римской империи по размеру и значению после Рима.

В 1869 г. английскими учеными были произведены первые археологические раскопки основанного Лисимахом города на горе, в результате которых миру была открыта красота античного города.

Остатки древнего Эфеса скрыты под почти непроходимым болотом.

== Легенда о основании города ==
Согласно легенде, Дельфийского оракула приказ — основать новый город. Место для нового города ему должны были указать Эгейского моря и высадился на берегу прекрасной бухты. Как раз в это время местные рыбаки жарили рыбу. От искры, которая вылетела из костра, загорелся куст, из которого выскочил потревоженный кабан. Здесь и был заложен город.

Дикий кабан стал символом города, где ему был установлен памятник.

Во время строительства города Андроклу пришлось встретиться с воинственным племенем амазонок, в одну из которых, Эфесию (что переводится как ''желанная''), он влюбился. В честь неё и был назван город. Позднее почти все амазонки стали женами греков-поселенцев.

== История ==

Город основан между XVI—XI&nbsp;вв.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. как ионическая колония греками-ионийцами из Афин.

В VII&nbsp;в.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. аристократическая форма правления в Эфесе сменилась тиранией, а в VI&nbsp;в.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. город был завоёван лидийским царем храм Артемиды. В Британском музее находятся колонны главного 546&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. Крез потерпел поражение от царя Персии Кира, Эфес вошёл в состав Персидского государства.

Во время восстания ионийцев 499&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. Эфес сначала присоединился к восставшим, но впоследствии вернулся под власть Персии и принимал участие на её стороне в греко-персидских войнах.

Около 470&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. афинянину Кимону удалось вернуть Эфесу свободу, после чего город вошёл в Делосский союз.

Когда началась 431—404&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э.) между Афинами и Спартой, Эфес оставался на стороне Афин, но около 412&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. присоединился к общему восстанию подконтрольных Афинам государств и стал союзником Спарты.

В 401&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. Эфес поддержал восстание Кира Младшего против его брата, персидского царя Артаксеркса.

После 386&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. город снова завоевали персы.

В 356&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. храм Артемиды был сожжен 334&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э.

эпидемией. Но жители города не хотели покидать свои дома. Тогда Лисимах приказал перекрыть доступ к пресной воде жителям старого города, что вынудило их переселиться на новые места.

Эфес поочередно пребывал под властью Египта и Сирии, пока в 189&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. одержав победу над Антиохом Великим, римляне не передали его пергамскому царю Евмену II, а в 133&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. город вошёл в состав Римского государства.

В 88&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. город присоединился к антиримскому восстанию городов Малой Азии, которое возглавил царь Понта Митридат, но уже в 86&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э. Эфес вернулся под власть Рима, а через два года город обложил тяжелой данью Сулла.

Во время гражданской войны в Риме, которая последовала после убийства Цезаря в 44&nbsp;г.&nbsp;до&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э., дань с Эфеса получали обе стороны, но при Августе город стал фактически столицей римской провинции Азия и со временем превратился в один из самых красивых городов Римской империи, пока его не разорили 262&nbsp;г.&nbsp;н.&nbsp;э..

На протяжении долгих столетий средневековья город, который подвергался бесчисленным набегам арабов и пиратов, был не более, чем деревня. В начале правления Османской империи Эфес был предан полному забвению.

Эфес христианской эпохи знаменит тем, что его посетил третий Вселенский собор.

В 35 г. «из занимавшихся чародейством довольно многие (Ефесяне), собравши книги свои (после проповедей Павла) сожгли пред всеми; и сложили цены их, и оказалось их на пятьдесят тысяч драхм (огромная библиотека!)»<ref>Деяния 19.19</ref>

Здесь проповедовал Иисуса Христа. Здесь же была построена первая в мире церковь, освящённая во имя Матери Божьей.

'''Ephesus''' (Hittite '''Apasa'''; Turkish '''Efes''') was a city of ancient Anatolia. During the period known as Classical Greece it was located in Ionia, where the Cayster River (''Küçük Menderes'') flows into the Aegean Sea. It belonged to the Ionian League. 

Ephesus hosted one of the Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.</ref> It is also the site of a large gladiator graveyard.

The city was famed for the Temple of Artemis (completed around 550 BC), and both were destroyed by the Goths in 263. The emperor Constantine I rebuilt much of the city and erected a new public bath. The town was again partially destroyed by an earthquake in 614. The importance of the city as a commercial centre declined as the harbour slowly filled with silt from the river.

Today's archaeological site lies 3 kilometers south of the Selçuk district of İzmir Province, Turkey. The ruins of Ephesus are a favorite international and local tourist attraction, partly owing to their easy accessibility from Adnan Menderes Airport and via the port of Kuşadası.

==History==
===Neolithic age===

The area surrounding  Ephesus was already inhabited during the Neolithic Age (about 6000 BC) as was revealed by the excavations at the nearby ''hoyuk'' (artificial mounds) of Arvalya and Cukurici.<ref>[http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/archives.php?id=1331 New findings push back estimated age of Ephesus] ''Turkish Daily News'' 1996-10-29</ref>

===Bronze age===
Excavations in recent years have unearthed settlements from the early Mycenaean era (1500-1400 BC) with ceramic pots was discovered close to the ruins of the basilica of St. John. <ref name="C. Özgünel"></ref> This was the period of the Mycenaean Expansion when the ''Achaioi'' (as they were called by Homer) settled in Ahhiyawa during the 14th and the 13th centuries BC. Scholars believe that Ephesus was founded on the settlement of Apasa (or ''Abasa''), a Bronze Age-city noted in 14th century BC Hittite sources as in the land of Ahhiyawa. <!--- Ahhiyawa was one of several (semi-)independent states surrounding the Hittite state ---> <!--- Arzawa, another independent state, was in southern Anatolia ---> <ref name= "Akurgal"></ref>

=== Dark age ===

The city of ''Ephesus'' itself was founded as an Attic-Ionian colony in the Lelegian inhabitants of the city and united his people with the remainder. He was a successful warrior and, as king, he was able to join the twelve cities of Ionia together into the Ionian League. During his reign the city began to prosper. He died in a battle against the Carians when he came to the aid of Priene, another city of the Ionian League. <ref name="Pausanius"></ref> Androklos and his dog are depicted on the Hadrian temple frieze, dating from the second century. Later, Greek historians such as Pausanias, Strabo and the poet Kallinos, and the historian Herodotos however reassigned the city's mythological foundation to Ephos, queen of the Amazons. 

The Greek goddess Pausanias (4.31.8). Pausanius mentions that the temple was built by Ephesus, son of the river god Caystrus. <ref> [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1133.html Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology] </ref> before the arrival of the Ionians. Of this structure, scarcely a trace remains.

=== Archaic period===
About 650 BC Ephesus was attacked by Cimmerians who razed the city, including the temple of Artemis. A few small Cimmerian artifacts can be seen at the archaeological museum of Ephese.

When the Cimmerians had been driven away, the city was ruled by a series of tyrants. After a revolt by the people, Ephesus was ruled by a council called the ''Kuretes''. The city prospered again, producing a number of important historical figures, such as the Soranus and Rufus.

About 560 BC Ephesus was conquered by the  Lydians under the mighty king Croesus. He treated the inhabitants with respect, despite ruling harshly, and even became the main contributor to the construction of the temple of Artemis.<ref>{{cite book

Croesus made the populations of the different settlements around Ephesus regroup (''synoikismos'') in the vicinity of the Temple of Artemis, enlarging the city.

Later in the same century, the Lydians under Croesus invaded Persia.  The Ionians refused a peace offer from Cyrus the Great, siding with the Lydians instead.  After the Persians defeated Croesus the Ionians offered to make peace but Cyrus insisted that they surrender and become part of the empire.<ref>Herodotus i. 141</ref>  They were defeated by the Persian army commander Harpagos in 547 BC. The Persians then incorporated the Greek cities of Asia Minor into the Achaemenid Empire. Those cities were then ruled by satraps.

=== Classical period ===
Ephesus continued to prosper. But when taxes continued to be raised under Cambyses II and Darius, the Ephesians participated in the Ionian Revolt against Persian rule in the Battle of Ephesus (498 BC), an event which instigated the Greco-Persian wars. In 479 BC, the Ionians, together with Athens and Sparta, were able to oust the Persians from Anatolia. In 478 BC, the Ionian cities entered with Athens and Sparta the Delian League against the Persians. Ephesus did not contribute ships, but only participated with financial support by offering the treasure of Apollo to the goddess Athena, protector of Athens.

During the Peloponnesian War, Ephesus was first allied to Athens but sided in a later phase, called the Decelean War, or the Ionian War with Sparta, which also had received the support of the Persians. As a result, the rule over the kingdoms of Anatolia was ceded again to Persia.

These wars didn't affect much the daily life in Ephesus. In those times, Ephesus was surprisingly modern in their social relations. They allowed strangers to integrate. Education was much valued. Through the cult of Artemis, the city also became a bastion of women's rights. Ephesus even had its female artists. In later times Pliny mentions having seen at Ephesus a representation of the goddess Diana by Timarata, the daughter of a painter.

In 356 BC the temple of Artemis was burnt down, according to legend, by a lunatic called Herostratus. By coincidence, this was the night that Alexander the Great was born. The inhabitants of Ephesus started at once with the restoration and even planning a larger and grander temple.

===Hellenistic period ===
When Alexander the Great defeated the Persian forces at the Battle of Granicus in 334 BC, the Greek cities of Asia Minor were liberated. The pro-Persian tyrant Syrpax and his family were stoned to death and Alexander was greeted warmly in Ephesus when he entered it in triumph. When he saw that the temple of Artemis was not yet finished, he proposed to finance the temple and have his name as an inscription of the front. But the inhabitants of Ephesus refused, claiming that it was not fitting for a god to build a temple for another god. After the death of Alexander in 323 BC, Ephesus came under the rule of Lysimachus, one of Alexander's generals, in 290 BC.

As the river Cayster was silting up the harbour, the resulting marshes were the cause of malaria and many deaths among the inhabitants. The people of Ephesus were forced to move to a new settlement 2 kilometers further on, when the king flooded the old city by blocking the sewers. <ref name="Strabo"></ref> This settlement was called after the king's second wife Arsinoe II of Egypt. After Lysimachus had destroyed the nearby cities of Lebedos and Colophon in 292 BC, he relocated their inhabitants to the new city. The architectural layout of the city would remain unchanged for the next 500 years.

Ephesus revolted after the treacherous death of Agathocles, giving the Syrian king Seleucus I Nicator an opportunity for removing and killing Lysimachus, his last rival, at the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BC. After the death of Lysimachos the town took again the name of Ephesus.

Thus Ephese became part of the Seleucid Empire. After the murder on king Antiochus II Theos and his Egyptian wife, pharao Ptolemy III invaded the Seleucid Empire and the Egyptian fleet swept the coast of Asia Minor. Ephesus came under Egyptian rule between 263-197 BC. 

When the Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great tried to regain the Greek cities of Asia Minor, he came in conflict with Rome. After a series of battles, he was defeated by Scipio Asiaticus at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC. As a result, Ephesus came under the rule of the Attalid king of Pergamon Eumenes II (197-133 BC). When his grandson Attalus III died without male children of his own, he left his kingdom to the Roman Republic.

===Roman Period===
Ephesus became subject of the Mithridates the Great, king of Pontus, when he conquered Western Anatolia. This led to the Asiatic Vespers, the slaughter of 80,000 Roman citizens in Asia Minor, or any person who spoke with a Latin accent. Many had lived in Ephesus. But when they saw how badly the people of Chios had been treated by Zenobius, a general of Mithridates, they refused entry to his army. Zenobius was invited into the city to visit Philopoemen (the father of Monima, the favorite wife of Mithridates) and the overseer of Ephesus. As the people expected nothing good of him, they threw him into prison and murdered him. Mithridates took revenge and inflicted terrible punishments. However, the Greek cities were given freedom and several substantial rights. Ephesus became, for a short time, self-governing. When Mithridates was defeated in the First Mithridatic War by the Roman consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Ephesus came back under Roman rule in 86 BC. Sulla imposed a huge indemnity, along with five years of back taxes, which left Asian cities heavily in debt for a long time to come. <ref name="Mithridatic War"></ref>

When proconsular Asia, which covered the western part of Asia Minor. Ephesus entered an era of prosperity. It became the seat of the governor, growing into a metropolis and a major center of commerce. It was second in importance and size only to Rome. <ref> Strabo . Geography (volume 1-7) 14.1.24. Cambridge: Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press </ref> Ephesus has been estimated to be in the range of 400,000 to 500,000 inhabitants in the year 100, making it the largest city in Roman Asia and of the day. Ephesus was at its peak during the first and second century AD.

The city was famed for the Diana) <ref> [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Turkey/_Periods/Greek/_Texts/LETGKB/Ephesus*.html accessed September 14, 2007]</ref>, who had her chief shrine there, the Library of Celsus, and its theatre, which was capable of holding 25,000 spectators. This open-air theater was used initially for drama, but during later Roman times gladiatorial combats were also held on its stage, with the first archaeological evidence of a gladiator graveyard found in May 2007.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6614479.stm http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6614479.stm]</ref> The population of  Ephesus also had several major bath complexes, built at various points while the city was under Roman rule. The city had one of the most advanced aqueduct systems in the ancient world, with multiple aqueducts of various sizes to supply different areas of the city, including 4 major aqueducts.

The city and the temple were destroyed by the Goths in 263. This marked the decline of the splendour of the city.

=== Byzantine era (395-1071)===
Ephesus remained the most important city of the Flavius Arcadius raised the level of the street between the theatre and the harbour. The basilica of St. John was built during the reign of emperor Justinian I in the sixth century.

The town was again partially destroyed by an earthquake in 614.

The importance of the city as a commercial centre declined as the harbour slowly filled with silt from the river (today, Küçük Menderes) despite repeated dredges during the city's history.<ref>[http://lexicorient.com/e.o/ephesus.htm accessed September 24, 2007]</ref>  (Today, the harbor is 5 kilometers inland).  The loss of its harbor caused Ephesus to lose its access to the Aegean Sea, which was important for trade. People started leaving the lowland of the city for the surrounding hills. The ruins of the temples were used as building blocks for new homes. Marble sculptures were ground to powder to make lime for plaster.
