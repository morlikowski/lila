'''City of Wakefield''' er et administrativt distrikt med status som ''city'' i West Yorkshire i England. Det har navn etter administrasjonssenteret Wakefield, men dekker også andre byer. 

Området var tidligere preget av kullgruvedrift. I storstreiken begynte i 1984 hadde tallet sunket til 15. Da gruveindustrien ble privatisert i 1994 var det bare to igjen, ''Prince of Wales'' i Pontefract og ''Kellingley'' i Knottingley. Pontefract-gruven stengte i 2002, og ''Kellingley'' er dermed den eneste som fortsatt er i drift pr. 2006.

Til tross for nedleggelsen av gruvene har store deler av distriktet klart seg nokså godt økonomisk, takket være boomen i 1980- og 1990-årene, men var pr. 2006 under det nasjonale gjennomsnittet. Den østlige delen, som er lengt unna Leeds, er generelt dårligere stilt enn den vestlige.

'''City of Wakefield''' is a local government district of city and Normanton, largest city in the European Union, but people in the other towns mentioned usually identify with that town rather than Wakefield, and Wakefield is not particularly well known nationally.

As recently as 2001, the Labour Party held more seats here than anywhere else in the country, but there has been a large swing against Labour in recent years; it only won 13 out of 21 seats in 2006.  The district is mainly made out of old coal-mining towns, although other industries include 1984 Strike began this had decreased to 15, however it still had more colleries than another district in the country. At the time of privatisation in November 1994, only two remained: the ''Prince of Wales'' at Pontefract, which closed in 2002, and ''Kellingley'' at Knottingley which is now the sole remainder of the industry that once dominated the district.  Most of the district's pits had been very hardline during the 1984 strike.

In recent years, the economic and physical condition of several of the former mining towns and villages in Wakefield District have started to improve due to the booming economy of Leeds - and an increase in numbers of commuters to the city from the sub-region - and a recognition of undeveloped assets. For instance Castleford, to the North East of Wakefield is seeing extensive development and investment because of the natural asset of its outlook on to the River Aire, its easy access to the national motorway network and the availability of former mining land for house-building. In Ossett, house prices have risen from an average of £50,000 in 1998 to £130,000 in 2003.

The district has only small proportion of ethnic minorities, and most of the settlements outside of the town of Wakefield are almost entirely White.  Crime is generally lower in this district than in the rest of West Yorkshire.  Although unemployment was amongst the highest in the country for most of the 1980s and 1990s, Wakefield District now has below-average unemployment. The "Wakefield East" ward had 4.7% unemployment in May 2005 (source: Office for National Statistics) - which was more than 1% higher than any other ward.  The eastern half of the district remains considerably less prosperous than the western half, with several deprived wards.  Other problems typical of such an area include rates of suicide that are consistently amongst the highest in the country and a [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20040201/ai_n12886027 heroin problem that saw addiction rise by an incredible 3361%] between 2000 and 2004.

A decision was made, in 2004, to transfer the district's extensive council housing to Wakefield and District Housing (WDH), an 'independent' housing association, who would be more efficient with repairs and maintaining decent accommodation; as council housing represented almost 30% of the district, this was the second-largest stock transfer in British history.  WDH are investing over £700m to regenerate the District and working with partners, such as WMDC, are investing in new housing within the District.

==Local Government==
The former Borough of Wakefield was raised to city status by letters patent in 1888.  It became a county borough in 1913, taking it out of the jurisdiction of the West Riding County Council.

The present boundaries were set in 1974 by the West Riding Normanton and Stanley, along with Wakefield Rural District and parts of Hemsworth Rural District and Osgoldcross Rural District.  The new metropolitan district's city status was reconfirmed by letters patent in 1974.

The Council's main headquarters are County Hall, originally built for the West Riding County Council and acquired by Wakefield in 1989.

==2006 Local government election==

The district is divided into 21 wards and each is represented on the district council by three councillors. Each councillor is elected on a first past the post basis, normally for a four-year period which is staggered with the other councillors of that ward so that only one councillor per ward is up for election at any one time. Exceptions to this include by-elections and ward boundary changes.

The city was the safest Labour council in England in 2003, but there has been a huge swing against Labour in recent years.  The Labour Party now has a majority of just one.  The situation is identical in neighbouring Barnsley, where Labour have also been reduced to a majority of one.

The table below summarises the results of the 2006 local government election. Each party is ordered by number of votes registered.
