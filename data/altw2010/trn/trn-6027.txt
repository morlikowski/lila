'''''Indestructible''''' è il sesto album dei Rancid, pubblicato il 19 agosto 2003.

==Il disco==
Il disco segna un ritorno del gruppo, ripercorrendo tutte le sonorità già sperimentate nei precedenti lavori: dallo hardcore di "''Out of control''". Come è loro abitudine, anche in Indestructible, le canzoni sono ispirate da avventure ed esperienze personali (basti pensare alla tragica "''Otherside''", dedicata al fratello scomparso di Lars, o a "Tropical London", che parla della separazione di Tim Armstrong dalla moglie Brody Dalle) o, come sempre scritte in viaggio lungo l'America ("''Memphis''")

'''''Indestructible''''' is the sixth Rancid, released on August 19, 2003 (see 2003 in music). On vinyl, it is also a double album. Despite critical acclaim, the band was criticized by many fans for ''Indestructible'''s poppier sound. It reached #15 on the charts, making it Rancid's highest charting album so far.

''Indestructible'' was not Rancid's final album. The band went on hiatus in this album's follow-up, making it seem possible that ''Indestructible'' could be Rancid's last recording with him.

==Writing and production==

After a break in 2001, Rancid returned to the studio with co-producer Brett Gurewitz in 2002, to record their next album. Work on it was meant a year long for the band. Most notably, finishing up the album was extremely stressful for all of the members of Rancid.

==Delay of release==
The album was delayed several times before its official release. First scheduled for release was summer/fall 2002, then early 2003, mid-2003 and now August 19, 2003. One of the reasons why ''Indestructible'' had yet to be released was their various other activities. Singer/guitarist album with his then-new side project Transplants and second guitarist album with Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards.

==Track listing==
*All songs by Armstrong and Frederiksen except where noted.
