'''Tritó''' ( en grec Τρίτων) és el satèl·lit més gran de Neptú. Va ser descobert per William Lassell el 1846, només 17 dies després del descobriment del planeta. També se l'anomena '''Neptú I'''.

És un cos esfèric rocós de 2.707 km de diàmetre. És, per tant, molt més gran que els altres satèl·lits neptunians (el segon és Proteu amb només 418 km). Orbita a 354.760 km de Neptú (i es troba a 4.500 milions de quilòmetres de la Terra).

Ha estat visitat per una sola nau espacial, la Voyager 2, el 25 d'agost de 1989. Gairebé tot el que sabem de Tritó és gràcies a aquest encontre.

== Nom ==
Deu el seu nom al déu Tritó de la Neptú en la Hiperió, Ariel i Umbriel). Durant molts anys el nom Tritó no va ser gaire utilitzat i en la literatura especialitzada se l'anomenava simplement "el satèl·lit de Neptú". Va ser, probablement, el descobriment d'un segon satèl·lit neptunià el Nereida, el que va precipitar l'adopció de Tritó com a nom oficial del satèl·lit.

== Característiques físiques ==
Tritó està desfigurat per violentes erupcions volcàniques i la seva superfície s'ha congelat i fos repetidament, quedant així solcada d'una intrincada xarxa d'enormes cadenes muntanyoses, valls i falles. També hi ha extenses regions planes cobertes de gels, i en general, conté molt pocs cràters visibles; això indica que la superfície és relativament jove. La seva densitat (2.061 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) és lleugerament més alta que la dels satèl·lits gelats de Saturn (com per exemple, Rea) suggerint una composició de 25% gel d'aigua i la resta material rocós. Es desconeix com és l'hemisferi nord (no estava iluminat quan va passar la Voyager 2) però gairebé tot l'hemisferi sud està cobert per un casquet de nitrogen i metà congelats.

Possiblement siga l'astre més fred del Plutó de 44 K. Això és degut, en part, al seu alt albedo (0,756) cosa que significa que poca de la llum solar que li arriba és absorbida.

La característica més interessant (i totalment inesperada) de Tritó són els seus volcans de gel. El material en erupció probablement sigui nitrogen líquid o compostos de metà. L'energia per a les erupcions la proporciona l'escalfament estacional del Sol.

La atmosfera (0,01 mbar), composta principalment per nitrogen amb una petita quantitat de metà, que s'estén fins als 10 km d'altura.

== Característiques orbitals ==

L'retrògrada. És l'únic dels grans satèl·lits que orbita en sentit contrari a la rotació del seu seu planeta. Alguns altres petits satèl·lits de Júpiter, Saturn i Urà també ho fan, però el més gran de tots ells, Febe té un diàmetre de només 220 km. A causa de la seva òrbita retrògrada, les forces de marea entre Neptú i Tritó extreuen energia de Tritó reduint el radi de la seva òrbita. En un futur molt llunyà Tritó acabarà trencant-se (potser formant un anell) o bé s'estrellarà contra Neptú.

'''Triton''' (, or as in Greek ''Τρίτων),''<ref></ref> is the largest  moon of the retrograde orbit, which is an orbit in the opposite direction to its planet's rotation. At 2,700&nbsp;km in diameter, it is the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System. Triton comprises more than 99.5% of all the mass known to orbit Neptune, including the planet's rings and twelve other known moons. It is also more massive than all the Solar System's 159 known smaller moons combined.

Because of its retrograde orbit (unique for an object of its size) and similar composition to Pluto, Triton is thought to have been captured from the Kuiper belt.<ref name="Agnor06"/> Triton consists of a crust of frozen nitrogen over an icy mantle believed to cover a substantial core of rock and metal.<ref name=book /> The core makes up two-thirds of its total mass. Triton has a mean density of 2.061&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup><ref name="SSD" /> and is composed of approximately 15–35% water ice.<ref name= book />

Triton is one of the few moons in the Solar System known to be geologically active. Its crust is dotted with geysers believed to erupt nitrogen.<ref name=solarsystemexploration>{{cite web

==Orbit and rotation==
Triton is unique among all large moons in the Solar System for its retrograde orbit around its planet (''i.e.'', it orbits in a direction opposite to the planet's rotation). Most of the outer Phoebe) has only 8% of the diameter (and 0.03% of the mass) of Triton.  

Triton's axis of rotation is also unusual, tilted 157 degrees with respect to Neptune's axis, which is in turn inclined 30 degrees from the plane of Neptune's orbit.<ref name=inclin /> The net result of these two axial tilts is that Triton's rotational axis lies in the plane of Neptune's orbit, and hence during Neptune's year each pole points almost directly toward the Sun, much like Uranus'. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the sun, probably resulting in radical seasonal changes as one pole then the other moves into the sunlight. 
The proximity of such a large moon to Neptune has resulted in tidal deceleration, which has altered the moon's orbit and rotation through gravitational interaction.

Triton's revolution around Neptune has become a nearly perfect circle with an eccentricity of almost zero. However, viscoelastic damping from tides alone are not believed to be capable of circularizing Triton's orbit in the time since the origin of the system, and gas drag from a prograde debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role.<ref name=inclin /> Tidal interactions have also meant that Triton's already close orbit to Neptune is slowly decaying further, and predictions are that, some 3.6&nbsp;billion years from now, Triton will pass within Neptune's Roche limit.<ref name="Chyba">{{cite journal

==Capture==
thumb|250 px|The [[Kuiper belt, from which Triton is believed to have originated]]
Moons in retrograde orbits cannot have formed out of the same region of the AU from the Sun. Believed to be the point of origin for the majority of short-period comets observed from Earth, it is also home to several large, planet-like bodies including Pluto, which is now recognized as the largest in a population of Kuiper belt objects (the Plutinos) locked in orbital step with Neptune. Triton is only slightly larger than Pluto and nearly identical in composition, which has led to the hypothesis that the two share a common origin.<ref name="Cruikshank2004">{{cite journal

The proposed capture of Triton may explain several features of the Neptunian system including the extremely eccentric orbit of Neptune's moon Nereid and the scarcity of moons as compared to the other gas giants.  Triton's initially eccentric orbit would have intersected irregular moons and disrupted those of smaller natural moons, dispersing them through gravitational interactions.<ref name=inclin /> 

The circularization of Triton's eccentric post-capture orbit would have resulted in heating of the moon by tidal forces. These would have kept Triton liquid for a billion years, which is supported by evidence of differentiation in the moon's interior.<ref name=solarsystemexploration/> 

There are two ways which Triton's capture may have occurred. In order to be gravitationally captured by a planet, a moon must be slowed down by losing energy. An early theory of how Triton may have been slowed was by collision with another object, either one that happened to be passing by Neptune (which is unlikely), or a moon or proto-moon in orbit around Neptune (which is more likely).<ref name= book /> Another hypothesis suggests that, before its capture, Triton may have had a massive companion similar to Pluto's moon Charon with which it formed a binary. When the binary encountered Neptune, Triton's companion was expelled, providing the required mechanism to capture Triton in an orbit around the planet. This hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence, including binaries being very common among the large Kuiper belt objects.<ref name=binary>{{cite web

==Surface features==
All detailed knowledge of the surface of Triton was acquired in a single encounter by the ''Voyager 2'' spacecraft in 1989.  The 40% of Triton's surface imaged by ''Voyager'' revealed rocky outcrops,  canyons and icy melt, mainly frozen methane. Triton is relatively flat; its observed topography never varies beyond a kilometer.<ref name=book>{{cite book

===Cryovolcanism===

Triton is geologically active; its surface is young and has relatively few impact craters. When the ''Voyager 2'' probe studied Triton, it observed numerous icy volcanoes or geysers erupting liquid nitrogen, dust, or methane compounds from beneath the surface in plumes up to 8&nbsp;km high.<ref name=voyager/>  Although Triton is made of various ices, its subsurface processes are similar to those that produce volcanoes and rift valleys on Earth, but with water and ammonia lavas as opposed to liquid rock.<ref name= book /> 

The volcanic activity is thought to be driven by seasonal heating from the Sun, unlike the tidal heating responsible for the volcanoes of Io.<ref name=nature /> Solar heat is trapped under surface nitrogen ice, which creates a form of "solid greenhouse effect", slowly heating the subsurface until nitrogen beneath evaporates and erupts through the crust.<ref name=book /> Between 1977 and the ''Voyager'' flyby in 1989, Triton shifted from a reddish colour, similar to Pluto, to a far paler hue, suggesting that cryovolcanism in the intervening decade had covered older reddish material with lighter nitrogen frosts.<ref name= book />

Triton's entire surface is cut by complex valleys and ridges, probably the result of tectonics and icy Hili and Mahilani are two candidate Zulu water sprite and a Io, and Enceladus as one of the few worlds of the Solar System with current known volcanic activity.<ref> {{cite journal
