'''Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton''', CVO, OBE (furthest south latitude at 88°23'S, 97&nbsp;nautical miles (180&nbsp;km), from the South Pole. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for the Parliament of the United Kingdom and was involved in various business ventures aimed at raising revenue for his polar explorations.

Shackleton is most noteworthy for leading the unsuccessful Endurance Expedition", between 1914 and 1916. Although Shackleton failed to achieve his goal of crossing the Antarctic continent on foot, he demonstrated the qualities of leadership for which he is best remembered when the expedition ship ''Endurance'' became trapped in the ice and was destroyed.  Shackleton, known by his contemporaries as "the Boss", led his men to refuge on Elephant Island before heading across  of the Southern Ocean to South Georgia, in an open boat with five other men. Upon reaching the remote island, Shackleton and two others crossed severe, mountainous terrain to reach a whaling station, from which he was able eventually to rescue his men on Elephant Island. All the men on ''Endurance'' survived their ordeal after spending 22&nbsp;months in the Antarctic, although three men of the supporting Ross Sea Party lost their lives.

Shackleton was a key figure in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration alongside Roald Amundsen, Douglas Mawson, and Robert Falcon Scott, each of whom is famed for exploits that captured the public imagination.  In recent times, he has become known for his leadership skills, and is the topic of many books and films that focus on the explorer's ability to lead men through challenging conditions.

===Childhood===
Ernest Shackleton was born on 15 February 1874, in Kilkea near Athy, County Kildare, Ireland, about   from Dublin. Ernest's father, Henry, and mother, Henrietta Letitia Sophia Gavan, were of Anglo-Irish ancestry.<ref> [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/shackleton_ernest.shtml Ernest Shackleton], ''BBC Historic Figures'' </ref> <ref> James A. Goodlad, [http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/scotia/gooant/gooant03.htm Scotland and the Antarctic], Section 3: Scott, Shackleton and Amundsen. ''Royal Scottish Geographical Society.'' ISBN 0-904049-04-3 </ref> Ernest was the second of their ten children and the first of two sons.<ref name="Johnson_9&ndash;12">Johnson, pp. 9&ndash;12</ref> In childhood he was described as "bright, good-natured,... and confident".<ref name="Huntford_7&ndash;11">Huntford, pp. 7&ndash;11</ref> In 1880, at six years old, Ernest moved to Dublin with his father, who was studying medicine.<ref name="Johnson_9&ndash;12"/> Four years later, the family moved from Ireland to Sydenham in suburban London to seek a better income and because their Anglo-Irish ancestry made them afraid to stay in Ireland after the  assassination of Lord Frederick Cavendish by Irish nationalists.<ref name="Mill"/> 

Ernest was schooled by a governess until the age of 11, when he entered Fir Lodge Preparatory School in West Hill, and was educated from ages 13 to 16 at public school for boys.<ref name="Mill"/> The young Shackleton did not distinguish himself as a scholar and was said to have been "bored" by his studies.<ref name = "Huntford_7&ndash;11"/> He was quoted later as saying:

 

In his final term at the college, however, he was able to achieve fifth place in his class of thirty-one.<ref name="Mill">Mill, pp.&nbsp;24, 72–80, 104–115, 150</ref>  Furthermore, from early childhood Shackleton was a voracious reader, which sparked a passion for adventure .<ref name="Kimmel">Kimmell, pp.&nbsp;4–5</ref>

===Maritime career===
At 16, Shackleton embarked on his career by joining the merchant marine. He chose this path for two reasons. Firstly, the fee to join a Royal Navy cadet ship was too expensive, and secondly, his father was able to procure him employment at the North Western Shipping Company aboard the sailing vessel ''Hoghton Tower''.<ref name="Huntford_7&ndash;11">Huntford, p. 11</ref> This position allowed Shackleton to experience life at sea without the strictness of the Navy. Hence, the young man formed acquaintances with a variety of people—"officer, engineers, and apprentices alike."<ref name="Perkins">Perkins, p. 89</ref> Following his initial voyage, Ernest agreed to a four-year apprenticeship, and in 1896 passed his examinations for First Mate. Two years later, at the age of 24, he became a Master Mariner, which entitled him to a ship of his own, should the opportunity arise.<ref name="Kimmel"/>

In 1900, while serving as Third Officer aboard the troopship ''Tintagel Castle'',  Shackleton met Cedric Longstaff, son of the Antarctic expedition donor Llewellyn Longstaff.<ref name="Huntford_25&ndash;29">Huntford, pp. 25&ndash;29</ref> Shackleton used this acquaintance to procure an interview with Longstaff senior, with a view to obtaining a place on Robert Falcon Scott's forthcoming expedition to the Antarctic, which was then being organised. Longstaff, impressed by Shackleton's keenness, recommended him to Sir Clements Markham, the expedition's overlord.<ref name="Huntford_25&ndash;29">Huntford, p. 29</ref>  Shackleton was soon accepted as a member of the National Antarctic Expedition.<ref name="Johnson_24&ndash;26">Johnson, pp. 24&ndash;26</ref> He was also commissioned Sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve.<ref>Huntford, p. 42</ref>

==Expedition years==
===''Discovery'' Expedition (1901–02)===

thumb|right|250px|''Discovery''
The British National Antarctic Expedition, also known as the Discovery Expedition after the ship RRS ''Discovery'' (1901–04), was led by Robert Falcon Scott with the purpose of undertaking scientific research and exploration along the coast of the Ross Sea in Antarctica.<ref>Fisher, pp.19&ndash;20</ref> It was the first time Scott had led an expedition, and his command experience in the Royal Navy ran to a brief spell in charge of a Torpedo Boat in 1893, which he managed to run aground.<ref>Crane, p. 50</ref><ref name="Speake">Speake, p.&nbsp;1072,1079</ref> Shackleton was assigned the duty of outfitting ''Discovery'' for the expedition.<ref name="Johnson_24&ndash;26"/> Scott and Shackleton had different backgrounds, with Scott having trained in the Royal Navy and preferring strict discipline. As a result, the relationship between Scott and Shackleton was tense.<ref name="Way"/>

''Discovery'' departed London on Edward Wilson, assistant surgeon and vertebrate zoologist, on a southern journey to achieve the highest possible latitude.<ref> This march was not a serious attempt on the farthest south at  on 31 December 1902, but were unable to continue southward because of terrain, severe conditions, and the onset of scurvy. Shackleton also suffered from heart and lung ailments.<ref name="Mill"/><ref name="Way">Caparrell&nbsp;&&nbsp;Morrell, pages&nbsp;30,31,32,42,53,61,89,91,141.</ref> Notably, they were  from the Pole and  farther south than any human had previously travelled.<ref name="Preston">Preston, pp.&nbsp;60–68</ref>

Shackleton was sent home by Scott aboard the relief ship ''Morning'' because of illness, even though he had almost fully recovered.<ref name="Mill"/> rations during marches and required naval discipline, having the crew mop the decks despite the water freezing immediately.<ref name="Preston"/><ref name="Way"/> Diana Preston quotes a story told years later by Albert Armitage, the expedition's second-in-command, that when Scott was confronted by the ship's doctor with evidence that Shackleton was not particularly sick he said, "If he does not go back sick he will go back in disgrace." There is no evidence of this beyond Armitage's word, the accusations, Preston asserts, of a bitter man.<ref name="Preston"/> Scott's biographer Ranulph Fiennes claims that there is little evidence that the two were unfriendly and that Shackleton was indeed sent home because he was ill. Regardless, Shackleton and Scott continued on friendly terms in subsequent correspondence, although the ''Discovery'' experience is described as a  "defining moment of Shackleton's life" and profoundly disappointing.<ref name="Way"/><ref name="Speake"/> Though they were publicly amicable, Shackleton and Scott continued to rival one another's exploits and compete for monetary resources and staff throughout their lives.<ref name="Way"/>

===Between the ''Discovery'' and ''Nimrod'' expeditions===
thumb|left|Ernest Shackleton's wife, Emily Dorman (Lady Shackleton)
Shackleton left ''The Discovery'' on Sir John Murray, president of the Sir Joseph Hooker, a botanist from Sir James Clark Ross's 1839&ndash;43 Antarctic expedition.  They presented him as the first "praiseworthy" person to return from the Discovery Expedition.<ref name="Mill"/> <ref>Eight ''Discovery'' crew members had exercised their right to return on the ''Morning'' after the one year's Antarctic service for which they had signed. It is not clear why this should exclude them from being praiseworthy.</ref>  Additionally, Shackleton noticed that Londoners had an unquenchable desire for his tales of the Antarctic, which helped him lay the groundwork for further expeditions.  

In search of regular employment, Shackleton applied for a commission in the Royal Navy but despite the sponsorship of Nordenskiöld Antarctic Expedition.<ref>Fisher, p. 78</ref>. He was then offered, and accepted, the secretaryship of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society.<ref name="Mill"/> On 9 April 1904 he married 35-year-old Emily Mary Dorman, with whom he shared a love of literature, particularly Robert Browning. The marriage produced three children.<ref>The youngest of Shackleton's children, Edward, became in due course a Member of the British Parliament and later was appointed to a life peerage as Lord Shackleton</ref> Shackleton wrote long letters to his wife during his explorations, but also engaged in several extramarital affairs, including one with the American actress Rosalind Chetwynd.<ref name="Way"/><ref>{{Citation

In 1905 Shackleton became a shareholder in a speculative company that aimed to make a fortune transporting Russian troops home from the Far East. Despite his assurances to Emily that "we are practically sure of the contract" nothing came of this scheme.<ref>Fisher, pp. 97&ndash;98</ref> He also ventured into politics, unsuccessfully standing in the 1906 General Election as the Dundee.<ref>He finished fourth of five candidates, with 3,865&nbsp;votes to the victor's 9,276. Morrell, p.&nbsp;32</ref> Meantime he had taken a job with wealthy Clydside industrialist William Beardmore (later Lord Invernairn), with a roving commission which involved interviewing prospective clients and entertaining Beardmore's business friends.<ref>Fisher, p. 99</ref>  Shackleton by this time, however,  was making no secret of his ambition to return to Antarctica at the head of his own expedition. 

Beardmore was sufficiently impressed with Shackleton to offer financial support,<ref>Beardmore's help took the form of guaranteeing a loan at Clydesdale Bank, for £7,000 (2008 equivalent approx. £350,000), not through an outright gift. Riffenburgh, p. 106</ref>  but other donations proved hard to come by. Nevertheless, in February 1907 Shackleton presented his plans for an Antarctic expedition to the Royal Geographic Society, the details of which, under the name British Antarctic Expedition, were published in the Royal Society's newsletter, ''Geographic Journal''.<ref name="Mill"/> The aim was the conquest of both the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. Shackleton then worked hard to persuade others of his wealthy friends and acquaintances to contribute, including Sir Phillip Lee Brocklehurst, who subscribed £2,000 (2008 equivalent £100,000) to secure a place on the expedition,<ref>Riffenburgh, p. 108</ref>  author Campbell Mackellar, and Guinness baron Lord Iveagh whose contribution was secured less than two weeks before the departure of the expedition ship ''Nimrod''.<ref>Riffenburgh, p. 130</ref>

===''Nimrod'' Expedition (1907–09) ===

To conserve coal, the ship was towed  by ''Koonya'' to the Antarctic ice.<ref name="Rubin">Rubin, pp. 42&ndash;55</ref>  Shackleton arranged for the expense to be split between the Barrier on 21 January 1908 it was found the former Barrier Inlet had expanded to a large bay&mdash;the Bay of Whales&mdash;and that ice conditions precluded a safe base there. A search for an anchorage at King Edward VII Land proved equally fruitless, so Shackleton was forced to break his undertaking to Scott and establish his winter quarters in McMurdo Sound.  As ''Discovery'''s old base  was inaccessible because of sea ice, Shackleton's base was eventually established at Cape Royds, about  north of the planned site.<ref name="Rubin"/> The party was in high spirits despite difficult conditions and the sickness of some crew members. Shackleton's inclusive leadership style built strong cameraderie, and it was during this voyage that he acquired his nickname "The Boss".<ref name="Way"/>

The South Pole was not attained, but on farthest south latitude of , a point only  from the Pole.<ref>Shackleton: ''Heart of the Antarctic'', p. 210. The distance from the Pole is commonly given as 97 or 98 miles, this being the distance in nautical miles.</ref>  The South Pole party also discovered the Beardmore Glacier route (named after Shackleton's patron) to the South Polar Plateau, and were the first persons to set foot on the plateau.<ref name="Rubin"/> They arrived back at McMurdo Sound after subsisting on half-rations for much of the perilous return journey; at one point the Boss gave the one biscuit allotted for the day to Frank Wild.<ref name="Mill"/> The expedition's other accomplishments included the first ascent of Mount Erebus, and a journey to the approximate location of the  South Magnetic Pole, reached on 16 January 1909 by Edgeworth David, Douglas Mawson, and Alistair MacKay.  

Shackleton returned to the knighted.<ref name="Mill"/> Soon after, he published a book about ''Nimrod'''s expedition titled ''The Heart of the Antarctic''.<ref>Shackleton,&nbsp;''Heart of the Antarctic...'',&nbsp;p.&nbsp;Front&nbsp;Cover</ref> Regarding the failure to reach the South Pole, Shackleton remarked to his wife: "Better a live donkey than a dead lion."<ref>Peter,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;347</ref>

===''Endurance'' Expedition (1914–16)===

Although Roald Amundsen reached the South Pole in 1911, public interest in the Antarctic continued. From early 1913 onwards Shackleton sought financial backing from donors to enable him to launch his Dame Janet Stancomb-Wills, an undisclosed sum.<ref>Huntford, p. 362 and pp. 375&ndash;77</ref> In due course Shackleton would acknowledge the generosity of these private donors by naming geographical features after them, including the Caird Coast and the Stancomb-Wills Promontory<ref name="Shackleton_South">Shackleton</ref> 

Interest in the expedition was enormous: Shackleton received more than 5,000&nbsp;applications for participation. Fifty-six men were finally chosen and divided into two groups for the two expedition ships: ''Endurance'' for the Weddell Sea team and ''Aurora'' for the Ross Sea party.<ref name="Shackleton_South"/> He chose people he considered the most qualified candidates, either from his personal experience&mdash;eight came from the ''Nimrod'' expedition&mdash;or on the recommendation of his colleagues. Shackleton's interviewing methods sometimes seemed eccentric; he believed that character and temperament were as important as technical ability,<ref>Huntford, p. 386</ref> and might ask unconventional questions. Thus physicist Reginald James was asked if he could sing;<ref name = "Fisher_311&ndash;15">Fisher, p. 312</ref> others were accepted on sight because Shackleton liked the look of them, or after the briefest of interrogations.<ref name = "Fisher_311&ndash;15">Fisher, pp. 313&ndash;15</ref> This means of selection was meant to ensure compatibility and camaraderie during the difficult journey ahead. Shackleton also loosened some traditional hierarchies, expecting all men, including the scientists, to take their share of ship's chores, even tasks such as scrubbing the decks.<ref name="Way"/> 

''Endurance'' left Plymouth for the Antarctic on 8 August 1914.<ref name="Shackleton_South"/> After stops at Buenos Aires and South Georgia she departed for the Weddell Sea on 5 December. As the ship moved southward  early ice was encountered, which slowed progress.  Deep in the Weddell Sea conditions gradually grew worse until, on 17 January 1915, ''Endurance'' became frozen fast in an ice floe, and on 24 February, realising that she would not now break free until the following spring, Shackleton ordered the ship wintered.<ref>Frank Worsley, captain of ''Endurance'', later wrote in ''Shackleton's Boat Journey'' that after the ship had initially become surrounded by ice, gales from the northeast swept the pack ice from the area from which they had come solidly around the ship.</ref><ref name="Shackleton_South"/> 

In May, the Antarctic sun set for the last time before winter.  When spring arrived, however, the breaking of the ice and subsequent movement of giant ice floes splintered the ship's hull.<ref name="Worsley_Endurance">Worsley (1999), ''Endurance: An Epic of Polar Adventure''</ref> Although ''Endurance'' withstood considerable stress, on 24 October she was forced against a large floe, and water began pouring in. After a few days, on 27 October, with the position at 69°05'S, 51°30'W, Shackleton gave the abandon-ship order and the men, provisions and equipment were transferred to the ice. Mrs. Chippy, the beloved cat of the carpenter, Harry McNish, and the youngest of the pups born during the expedition were shot soon afterwards because Shackleton did not think they would survive the prolonged ordeal ahead.<ref>Huntford, p. 458</ref> On 21 November 1915, the wreck finally slipped beneath the ice.<ref name="Shackleton_South"/>

Sir '''Ernest Henry Shackleton''' (anglo-irlandais devenu célèbre pour ses expéditions dans l'Antarctique au début du .

== Jeunesse ==
Ernest Henry Shackleton est né le 15 février 1874, à Kilkea, en Irlande, deuxième enfant d'une famille qui en comptera 10 (huit filles et deux garçons). Il entre dans la marine marchande à 17 ans et effectue de nombreux voyages en mer à bord d'un trois-mâts britannique. Il obtient son brevet de lieutenant à 24 ans.

== Les expéditions en Antarctique ==
=== L'expédition Discovery (1901-1904) ===
thumb|150px|right|En tenue d'explorateur, en 1916

En 1901, il embarque pour la première fois avec Robert Falcon Scott et le docteur Edward Wilson pour une expédition dans l'Antarctique. En novembre 1902, ils franchissent la latitude la plus australe jamais atteinte par l'homme, 82°16 Sud. Atteint par le scorbut, il est renvoyé par Scott à Londres et doit renoncer provisoirement à ses rêves d'explorateur. 

=== L'expédition Nimrod (1907-1909) ===

Aguerri par l'expédition précédente, il monte sa propre expédition, et, le 7 août 1907, il part à nouveau vers l'Antarctique, qu'il atteint au début de l'année 1908. Après de nombreux efforts, l'expédition atteint, le 9 janvier 1909, la latitude record de 88°23 Sud, mais ses membres sont contraints de faire demi-tour, à seulement 180 km du pôle Sud. Après avoir effectué une traversée à pied de près de 3 000 km dans l'Antarctique, il retourne une nouvelle fois vers le Royaume-Uni. Le pôle Sud est conquis le 14 décembre 1911 par Roald Amundsen.

À son retour à Londres, Shackleton est anobli par le roi.

=== L'expédition Endurance (1914-1917) ===
thumb|right|La statue de Shackleton créée par Charles Sargeant Jagger qui orne la facade de la ''[[Royal Geographical Society'' dans le quartier de Kensington à Londres.]]

Shackleton, déçu, décide, à titre de défi, de tenter une traversée du continent Antarctique à pied, en passant par le pôle, soit 3 300 km de marche. Avec 27 hommes, il quitte le Endurance''. Parmi les membres de l'expédition figurent Aurora'', qui a été affrété pour récupérer les membres de l'expédition à son arrivée de l'autre côté du continent Antarctique, ne dispose pas d'une équipe aussi soudée et emmenée par un leader aussi charismatique. Ayant perdu trois hommes (dont le capitaine) après que l'Aurora ait rompu ses amarres dans le Erebus dans l'île de Ross. 

Après avoir sauvé les naufragés de l'''Endurance'', sir Ernest Shackleton retourne secourir ces dix hommes qu'il espère retrouver vivants après le séjour d'une année que ceux-ci ont passé sous le toit de l'ancienne cabane de Scott. Seuls sept d'entre eux ont survécu grâce à la viande de phoque et de manchot et à quelques provisions restées dans cette hutte.

À son retour au Royaume-Uni, le 29 mai 1917, Shackleton, malgré ses exploits héroïques, n'est pas accueilli en héros car, lui dit-on, les véritables héros sont au front. On était alors en pleine Première Guerre mondiale.

=== L'expédition Shackleton-Rowett (1921-1922) ===

À la fin de l'année 1921, Shackleton retourna en Worsley, pour faire des relevés de cartes et des observations scientifiques. Il ne reviendra jamais de ce dernier voyage. Le soir même de son arrivée en Géorgie du Sud, le 5 janvier 1922, Shackleton, qui souffrait depuis des années d'insuffisances cardiaques, fut victime d'une crise cardiaque en pleine nuit, dans son lit, veillé par les deux médecins de l’''Endurance'' qui faisaient partie de l'expédition.
