金庸小說中的'''郭靖'''，於1200年10月出生，1273年1月31日逝世，是《射雕英雄傳》的男主角和《神雕俠侶》中的重要角色之一。他雖然生性單純，但他不但重情重義、勤奮、愛國愛民，而且天生一副俠義心腸、武功蓋世和用兵如神，是金庸小說中最受歡迎的男主角之一。

==生平==
===《射鵰英雄傳》===
郭靖早年在蒙古部落成長，除江南七怪的武藝外，也習得一身射箭、搏擊術（桃花島時與歐陽克對戰，曾不經意在落敗時使出蒙古摔角），結識成吉思汗鐵木真四子拖雷，並結拜為義兄弟；後來在中原結識黃蓉，並在機緣巧合之下習得降龍十八掌、九陰真經、空明拳和雙手互搏這四套絕世武功，令他在故事後段成為了絕頂高手，並在第二次華山論劍和「東邪」黃藥師及「北丐」洪七公打成平手；他曾用岳飛在《武穆遺書》的兵法為鐵木真的西征立下不少汗馬功勞；而《射鵰英雄傳》的結尾，正是郭靖陪伴鐵木真在西夏一帶打獵射鵰，鐵木真年老力衰，崩於金帳時口中念念不忘郭靖對他說的「英雄」。

===《神鵰俠侶》===
雖然郭靖在小說中並非主角，但他仍然扮演舉足輕重的角色。小說中的郭靖爲人忠厚穩重，憂國憂民，而且武藝高強，多次令強敵武林數一數二的絕頂高手。其座右銘「俠之大者，爲國爲民」道出了他一生爲之奮鬥的目標。此外，他在小說中亦是護國將軍，善於調兵遣將，多年來和妻子武林的景仰，不過卻成為了蒙古人的眼中釘。小說男主角楊過稱呼郭靖為「郭伯伯」，但楊過卻誤以為他是殺父仇人。郭靖在《神鵰俠侶》結尾時成爲「天下五絕」之一，傳承師父「北丐」洪七公的北位，是爲「'''北俠'''」。

===《倚天屠龍記》===
金庸在小說中略表了郭黃夫婦後事。在襄陽快要失守時，他和黃蓉請人製造倚天劍和屠龍刀，把武功秘笈和兵書藏於其中，並交給郭襄和郭破虜。「城破，郭黃夫婦亡」，亂世英雄不得其終。

==Character Description==
'''Guo Jing''' is described in the story as having thick eyebrows and large eyes, of sturdy and strong stature, and a complexion that is somewhere between dark and fair. He is frequently described as "dumb", "slow", and inarticulate, thereby the complete opposite of his love interest, the clever and witty Huang Rong. 

His most distinguishing feature, apart from his slowness, is his constant strife for moral rectitude (almost to a fault as shown in how far he was willing to punish his own daughter in the Han boy in the Legend of the Condor Heroes, he considered personal loyalty to be the highest virtues. In the Return of the Condor Heroes, the now matured and intelligent Guo Jing was very devoted to serving the people of his birth country.

==Guo Jing's Martial Arts==
By the time he reached middle age, Guo Jing was among the most accomplished and powerful martial artists of his era.  He had a broad and deep body of martial arts skills that was unsurpassed among the martial artists of the Central Plains.  At the end of ''The Return of the Condor Heroes'', he takes his place among the five great martial artists, known as ''Northern Hero'' (Bei Xia, 北俠), the successor of his teacher ''Northern Beggar'', Hong Qigong (北丐, 洪七公), for his years of devotion in defending the Song Dynasty. His repertoire included:

===Mongolian Archery and Wrestling===

Guo Jing was among the finest archers in the Mongol Empire, having trained with the great Mongolian archer and military leader Jebe for over a decade. Guo Jing famously shot down two eagles (since condors don't exist in China) with a single arrow during his youth in Mongolia.  He was also an accomplished wrestler in the Mongolian style of wrestling.

===Martial arts of the Jiangnan Qi Guai (江南七怪武功)===

Guo Jing's first introduction to the martial arts of his Chinese homeland came from the Jiangnan Qi Guai (''lit. "Jiangnan's Seven Freaks"'') - seven martial artists from the southern Chinese city of Jiaxing who located Guo Jing at the age of six and trained him in their various martial arts so that when Guo Jing turned eighteen years of age, he could compete against Yang Kang (楊康), the student of Quanzhen Taoist Qiu Chuji (丘處機).  The Jiangnan Qi Guai were not elite martial artists, but their early training provided Guo Jing with a good foundation for the more advanced martial arts he would learn later in his life.

===Quanzhen Pai Wu Gong (Quanzhen Sect Martial Arts) (全真派武功)===

Quanzhen Sect elders Ma Yu (馬鈺), Qiu Chuji (丘處機), and Wang Chuyi (王處一) taught Guo Jing various aspects of the Quanzhen Sect's martial arts, such as their ''qigong'' (氣功) techniques. He was also able to grasp the essence of the famed ''Big Dipper Formation'' after reading the 9 Yin Manual and watching the formation used in real combat.

The famous and fearsomely powerful martial art of the waijia or external style martial art in the world, being unmatched in its sheer power. ''Xianglong Shi Ba Zhang'' became Guo Jing's most powerful martial art skill and his default fighting technique.

===Kongming Quan (Vacant Fist) (七十二路空明拳) ===

These skills were taught to Guo Jing by his sworn brother Zhou Botong (周伯通) at Peach Blossom Island (桃花島). ''Kongming Quan'' gave Guo Jing an alternate attacking skill to ''Xianglong Shi Ba Zhang.'' The novel also describes this attack as the polar opposite of ''Xianglong Shi Ba Zhang'', being the epitome of the neijia martial arts, unmatched in subtlety and yet equal to the ''Xianglong Shi Ba Zhang'' in power and ingenuity of style. 

=== Shuang Shou Hu Bo (Technique of Ambidexterity)(雙手互搏)===
Zhou Botong also taught Guo Jing the skills of ''Shuang Shou Hu Bo'' at Peach Blossom Island. This enabled Guo Jing to simultaneously use a different martial art with each arm, often bewildering and overwhelming his enemies in the process. This also means that fighting him is akin to battling 2 opponents at the same time, effectively increasing his combat prowess, even though he is not necessarily more powerful.
