'''-{zh-hans:太平间; zh-hant:太平間; zh-hk:殮房; zh-sg:停尸间;}-'''，又稱-{zh-hans:'''停尸房'''、'''殓房'''; zh-hant:'''停屍房'''、'''殮房'''; zh-hk:'''停屍間'''、'''太平間'''; zh-sg:'''太平间'''、'''殓房''';}-、'''陈尸所'''、'''往生室'''，是離世之後，遺體很少立即火化，而是會在殮房停放上兩、三天，原因：
* 給予後人有充足的時間安排葬禮儀式。
* 以確定死者不會突然復活，然後才落葬。
* 死者身份不明，需要家属验尸或DNA指纹分析。
* 死因不明，家属要求病理学医师验尸。
* 警方需要死因调查。
* 当地风俗要求特别手续，如僵化或尸体防腐。

殮房的停屍間有些是有雪櫃的。太平間的工作人員對屍體不一定會妥善處理，有時甚至傳出姦屍的事故，被稱為戀屍癖<ref>[http://discovery.qihoo.com/article/q6934215,f73cff,.html 关于恋尸癖的科学认识]</ref>。

A '''morgue''' or '''mortuary''' is a building or room (as in a hospital) used for the storage of human remains.

''Morgue'' is predominantly used in British hospitals to enable discussion in front of patients.  The term ''morgue'' is derived from French ''morguer'', which means 'to look at solemnly, to defy'. The term was first used to describe the inner wicket of a prison, where prisoners were kept for some time, during which the jailers and turnkeys would spend time looking at the prisoners so that they would be able to recognize them. Relating to dead people, the name was first given to a building in Paris, which, in the middle of the fifth century, was part of the Châtelet and was used for the keeping and identification of unknown corpses. 

The person responsible for handling and washing the bodies is the Diener.

Probably because it is in a sense where the dead bodies are kept, the term '''morgue''' is also used in the United States to refer to the room in which newspaper or magazine publishers keep their back issues and other historical references.

Morgue - Morgue or mortuary cold chamber
There are two types of mortuary cold chambers:

*Morgue - Positive temperature
+2/+4 °C which is the most usual for keeping the bodies a few days or a few weeks, but does not prevent decomposition of the corpse, which continues, albeit at a slow rate.

*Morgue - Negative temperature
-15°C/-25 °C which is usual in forensic institutes, especially for bodies which have not yet been identified. At these temperatures, the body is completely frozen and decomposition totally halted.

The mortuary cold chamber is used to keep the deceased as long as is necessary for identification purposes, ''post-postmortem'' examination, or while awaiting burial.
