'''F/A-18 Hornet''', (MiG-29K Fulcrum-D'dir.

C, D, E ve F olmak üzere 4 türevi bulunmaktadır. Uçak iki motorludur. Uçakta C v E modelinde tek, D ve F modelinde iki mürettebat vardır.

''F/A-18 Hornet'' tek ve iki kişilik , iki motorlu, çok görevli bir av/saldırı uçağı olup kara üslerinden veya uçak gemilerinden hareket edebilir. ''F/A-18'' değişik görevleri yerine getirebilir; bunların içinde hava üstünlük, refakat, düşman savunmalarını susturma, keşif, ileri hat hava kontrolu, yakın ve derin hava desteği, gündüz ve gece saldırı söylenebilir. ''Hornet''ler F-4 Phantom II av, A-7 Corsair hafif taarruz ve A-6 Intruderların yerini almıştır (bu uçaklar 1990’da emekliye ayrılmıştır). 

''YF-17''’nin konfigurasyonu muhafaza edilmesine rağmen ''F-18'' yepyeni bir uçak olmuştur. Tek kişilik av ve saldırı görev yeteneklerini yerine getirebilmek için dijital bilgisayarlardaki son teknolojik gelişmelerden yararlanılmıştır. Katod tüplü göstergeleri içeren kokpit ekranları, simulatörlerde pilotların tamamen gelişmesini sağlayan uygun kumanda teknikleri ile belirtilen görevleri yerine getirebilecek tek kişilik uygulama gerçekleştirilmiştir. 

Tek kişilik ''F/A-18A'' ile iki kişilik ''F/A-18B'' 1983’de hizmete girmiştir. A ve B modellerinin başarılı 400 uçaklık uygulamasından sonra  Donanma gelişmiş modeller olan ''F/A-18C'' (tek kişilik) ve ''F/A-18D'' (iki kişilik) modelleri 1987’den itibaren teslim almaya başlamıştır. Bu “Hornet”ler AMRAAM orta menzilli havadan havaya gelişmiş füze sistemleri ve havadan karaya Maverick füzelerini taşıyabiliyordu. İki yıl sonra da bu uçakların gece görev yetenekleri geliştirildi. 

Çok görevli ''F/A-18E/F Super Hornet''kombat yetenekleri ispatlanmış olan ''F/A-18C/D''’nin geliştirilmiş bir modelidir. Emekliye ayrılmış ''A-6'' ile kıyaslanabilecek tarzda filo komutanına menzil, dayanıklılık ve silah çeşitliliği sunabilmektedir. Yeni modeller öncekilerden 1,28 metra daha uzundur, %25 daha geniş kanat alanına sahiptir ve %33 daha fazla dahili yakıt taşıyabilmektedir. Bu da ona menzilde %41, havada kalmada %50 artma sağlamaktadır. İki adet ilave silah istasyonuna sahiptir. Bu da havadan havaya ve havadan karaya silah yükünde esneklik sağlamaktadır. Ayrıca JDAM ve JSOW gibi akıllı mühimmat da taşıyabilmektedir. 

''Super Hornet'' yaklaşık 8.050 kg yükü onbir harici istasyonda taşıyabilmektedir. Her türlü hava şartlarında görev yapabilen “havadan havaya” radara, güdümlü ve klasik silahların hassas sevki için kontrol sistemlerine sahiptir. Uçakta iki kanat ucu istasyonu, yakıt tankları veya havadan karaya füzeler için her kanat altında dört istasyon, Sparrow’lar veya algılayıcılar için gövde altında kenarlarda iki istasyon ve bir de gövde altında ortada yakıt tankı veya havadan karaya silahlar için bir istasyon bulunmaktadır. Gövde içinde, burun kısmında da bir adet 20mm M61A1 Vulcan top vardır. 

İki adet general Electric ''F414 turbofan'' kullanılarak motor itiş gücü 159,59kN’dan 195,30kN’a çıkartılmıştır. ''F/A-18C/D''’lerde düşük görüntülenme teknolojisi uygulanmakla birlikte ''F/A-18E/F''’lerde hayatta kalabilme olanaklarının optimizasyonu ön plana alınarak dizayn edilmiştir. F-18 hizmete girdiğinden bu yana 15 dünya rekoru kırmıştır.

The U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, the Hornet is also used by the air forces of several other nations.  It has been the aerial demonstration aircraft for the U.S. Navy's suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), interdiction, reconnaissance. Its versatility and reliability have proven it to be a valuable carrier asset, though it has been criticized for its lack of range and payload compared to its contemporaries.<ref name=FedAmSci/> 

The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is a distinct, evolutionary upgrade to the F/A-18 designed to serve a complementary role with Hornets in the U.S. Navy.<ref name="NavySuper"></ref>

==Development==
===Origins===
Development of the F/A-18 came as a result of the U.S. Navy's Naval Fighter-Attack, Experimental (VFAX) program to procure a multirole aircraft to replace the A-4 Skyhawk, the A-7 Corsair II, remaining F-4 Phantom IIs and to complement the F-14 Tomcat. Vice Admiral Kent Lee, then head of Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), was the lead advocate for the VFAX against strong opposition from many Navy officers, including Vice Admiral William D. Houser, deputy chief of naval operations for air warfare - the highest ranking naval aviator.<ref name="Kelly"> Kelly, Orr. ''Hornet: the Inside Story of the F/A-18''. Novato, California: Presido Press, 1990. ISBN 0-89141-344-8.</ref> 

thumb|right|The [[YF-17 Cobra was navalized and developed into the F/A-18.]]

In August 1973, Congress mandated that the Navy pursue a lower-cost alternative to the F-14. YF-16 and YF-17.<ref name="NavyHistoryHornet"></ref>  The Air Force competition specified a day fighter with no strike capability. In May 1974, the House Armed Services Committee redirected $34 million from the VFAX to a new program, the Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF),<ref name="NavyHistoryHornet"/> intended to make maximum use of the technology developed for the LWF program.<ref name="Jenkins_p19"/>

===Redesigning the YF-17===

Though the YF-16 won the LWF competition, the Navy was skeptical that an aircraft with one engine and narrow landing gear could be easily or economically adapted to carrier service, and refused to adopt an F-16 derivative. The Navy fought for and won permission to develop an aircraft based on the YF-17.  Since the LWF did not share the design requirements of the VFAX, the Navy asked McDonnell Douglas and Northrop to design a new aircraft around the configuration and design principles of the YF-17. The new aircraft, designated the F-18, shared not a single essential dimension or primary structure with the YF-17. Secretary of the Navy W. Graham Claytor announced on 1 March 1977 that the name of the aircraft would be "Hornet".<ref name="Jenkins_p19"/>

Northrop had enlisted the aid of McDonnell Douglas as a secondary contractor on the NACF proposal to capitalize on the latter's extensive experience in building carrier aircraft, including the highly successful F-4 Phantom II. On the F-18, the two companies agreed to split the parts manufacture evenly, with McDonnell Douglas completing the final assembly, representing ~20% of the work. McDonnell Douglas built the wings, stabilators, and forward fuselage; Northrop built the center and aft fuselage and vertical stabilizers. McDonnell Douglas was the prime contractor for the naval versions.<ref name="NavyHistoryHornet"/> Northrop would become the prime contractor and take over final assembly for the F-18L land-based version which Northrop hoped to sell on the export market.<ref name="Jenkins_p19"/>

The F-18, initially known as McDonnell Douglas Model 267, was drastically modified from the YF-17 while retaining the same basic configuration. For carrier operations, the airframe, undercarriage, and arrestor hook were strengthened, folding wings and catapult attachments were added, and the landing gear widened.<ref name="Jenkins_p22">Jenkins 2000, p. 22-26.</ref> To meet Navy range and reserves requirements, McDonnell increased fuel capacity by , with the enlargement of the dorsal spine and the addition of a 96 gallon fuel cell to each wing (the YF-17 had dry wings). Most visibly, a "snag" was added to the leading edge of the wings and stabilators to prevent a flutter discovered in the F-15 stabilator. The wings and stabilators were enlarged, the aft fuselage widened by , and the engines canted outward at the front. These changes added  to the gross weight, bringing it to . The computer-assisted control system of the YF-17 was replaced with a wholly digital fly-by-wire system with quadruple-redundancy, the first to be installed in a production fighter.<ref name="Jenkins_p22"/>

The original plan specified acquiring 780 total of three closely related models: the single seat F-18A fighter and A-18A attack aircraft, differing only in avionics, and the dual-seat TF-18A, which retained full mission capability of the F-18,<ref name=FedAmSci/> except with a reduced fuel load. With redesign of the stores stations and improvements in avionics and multifunction displays, it became possible to combine the A-18A and F-18A into one aircraft.<ref name="Jenkins_p19"/> Starting in 1980, the aircraft began being referred to as the F/A-18A, and the designation was officially announced on 1 April 1984. The TF-18A was redesignated F/A-18B.<ref name="Jenkins_p19"/><ref name=FedAmSci />

===Northrop's F-18L===
Northrop developed the F-18L as a potential export aircraft. Since it did not have to be strengthened for carrier service, it was expected to be lighter and better performing<ref>http://home.att.net/~jbaugher4/f18_9.html</ref>, and a strong competitor to the F-16 Fighting Falcon then being offered to American allies. The F-18L was  (approximately 30%) lighter than the F/A-18A, due to a lighter landing gear, removal of the wing folding mechanism, and reduced part thickness in areas. Though the aircraft retained a lightened arresting hook, the most obvious external difference was the removal of the "snags" on the leading edge of the wings and stabilators. It still retained 71% commonality with the F/A-18 by parts weight, and 90% of the high-value systems, including the avionics, radar, and ECM suite, though alternatives were offered. Unlike the F/A-18, the F-18L carried no fuel in its wings and lacked weapons stations on the intakes.  It had three underwing pylons on each side instead.<ref name="Jenkins_p26">Jenkins 2000, p. 26-29.</ref>

The partnership between the McDonnell Douglas and Northrop soured over competition for foreign sales for the two models. Northrop felt that McDonnell Douglas would put the F/A-18 in direct competition with the F-18L. In October 1979, Northrop filed a series of lawsuits charging that McDonnell was using Northrop technology developed for the F-18L for foreign sales in violation of their agreement, and asked for a moratorium on foreign sales of the Hornet via McDonnell Douglas. The case was resolved in 1985 when McDonnell agreed to pay Northrop $50 million for complete rights to the design, without any admission of wrongdoing. By then Northrop had ceased work on the F-18L, and most export orders were captured by the F-16 or the F/A-18.<ref name="Jenkins_p26"/>

===Into production===

During flight testing, the snag on the leading edge of the stabilators was filled in, and the gap between the Leading edge extensions (LEX) and the fuselage mostly filled in. The gap, called the boundary layer air discharge (BLAD) slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack. However, they also generated a great deal of parasitic drag, worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to bleed air from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme aerodynamic loads, resulting in a momentary grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened.  Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers.  This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect.<ref name="Jenkins_p35">Jenkins 2000, p. 35.</ref>

The first production F/A-18A flew on 12 April 1980.  After a production run of 380 F/A-18As<ref name="BoeingMilestones"/> (including the nine assigned to flight systems development), manufacture shifted to the F/A-18C in September 1987.<ref name=FedAmSci/> 

==Design==
thumb|right|A Hornet doing a high-g pull-up during an air show. The high angle of attack causes powerful [[wingtip vortices|vortices to form at the leading edge extensions.]]

The F/A-18 is a twin engine, mid-wing, multi-mission tactical aircraft. It is superbly maneuverable, owing to its good thrust to weight ratio, digital fly-by-wire control system, and leading edge extensions (LEX). The LEX allow the Hornet to remain controllable at high angles of attack. This is because the LEX produce powerful vortices over the wings, creating turbulent airflow over the wings and thus delaying or eliminating the aerodynamic separation responsible for stall, allowing the Hornet's wings to generate lift several times the aircraft's weight, despite high angles of attack. The Hornet is therefore capable of extremely tight turns over a large range of speeds.

Canted vertical stabilizers are another distinguishing design element, and among the other design characteristics that enable the Hornet's excellent high angle-of-attack capability include oversized horizontal stabilators, oversized trailing edge flaps that operate as flaperons, large full-length leading-edge flaps, and flight control computer programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right.  The Hornet's normally high angle-of-attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV). NASA used the F-18 HARV to demonstrate flight handling characteristics at high angle-of-attack (alpha) of 65-70 degrees using thrust vectoring vanes.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-002-DFRC.html F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) fact sheet], NASA/Dryden Flight Research Center.</ref> F/A-18 stabilators were also used as canards on NASA's F-15S/MTD.

The Hornet was among the first aircraft to heavily utilize multi-function displays, which at the switch of a button allow the pilot to perform either fighter or attack roles or both. This "force multiplier" capability gives the operational commander more flexibility in employing tactical aircraft in a rapidly changing battle scenario. It was the first Navy aircraft to incorporate a digital multiplex avionics bus, enabling easy upgrades.<ref name=FedAmSci></ref>

The Hornet is also notable for having been designed with maintenance in mind, and as a result has required far less downtime than its heavier counterparts, the F-14 Tomcat and the A-6 Intruder. Its mean time between failure is three times greater than any other Navy strike aircraft, and requires half the maintenance time.<ref name=FedAmSci/> For example, whereas replacing the engine on the A-4 Skyhawk required removing the aircraft's tail, the engine on the Hornet is attached at only three points and can be directly removed without excessive disassembly.  An experienced maintenance crew can remove and replace an F/A-18 engine in only a couple of hours.

The F404-GE-400 or F404-GE-402 engines powering the Hornet were also innovative in that they were designed with operability, reliability, and maintainability first. The result is an engine that, while unexceptional on paper in terms of rated performance, demonstrates exceptional robustness under a variety of conditions and is resistant to stall and flameout. By contrast, the F-14A were notoriously prone to compressor stall and flameout under certain flight conditions.

The engine air inlets of the Hornet, like that of the F-16, are "fixed", while those of the F-4, F-14, and F-15 have variable geometry or variable ramp engine air inlets. The variable geometry enables high-speed aircraft to keep the velocity of the air reaching the engine below supersonic. This is one speed limiting factor in the Hornet design. Instead, the Hornet uses bleed air vents on the inboard surface of the engine air intake ducts to slow and reduce the amount of air reaching the engine. While not as effective as variable geometry, the bleed air technique functions well enough to achieve near Mach 2 speeds, which is within the designed mission requirements. The less sophisticated design is also more robust.

Because it was designed as a light multirole aircraft to complement the specialized F-14 and A-6 airframes, it had a relatively low internal fuel fraction. That is, its internal fuel capacity is small relative to its take-off weight, at around 23%. Most aircraft of its class have a fuel fraction between .30 to .35. This situation was exacerbated by the addition of new avionics over its lifespan, further reducing the fuel fraction.  This lead to 330-gallon external tanks being a common sight on F/A-18s, with the centerline and inner wings stations (numbered 3, 5 and 7) being plumbed to transfer fuel.

===Design evolution===
In the 1990s, the US Navy faced the need to replace its aging F-35C Lightning II, which will primarily replace F/A-18A-D Hornets.

==Operational history==
===United States===
====Entry into service====
thumb|right|F/A 18 Hornets on the [[flight deck of the ''Nimitz''-class ''Harry S. Truman'']]

McDonnell Douglas rolled out the first F/A-18A on NAS Pax River,<ref name=FedAmSci/> instead of near the site of manufacture, and involving Navy test pilots instead of contractor pilots much earlier in the process. 

In March 1979, Lt Cdr John Padgett became the first Navy pilot to fly the F/A-18.<ref name="Jenkins_p29">Jenkins 2000, p. 29.</ref> In all, nine F/A-18As and two F/A-18Bs were assigned to flight systems development. 

thumb|left|An F/A-18 taking off from [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63)|USS ''Kitty Hawk''.]]

Following trials and operational testing by VX-4 and VX-5, Hornets began to fill the Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRS) A-7Es, respectively.<ref name=FedAmSci/> 

The initial fleet reports were complimentary, indicating that the Hornet was extraordinarily reliable, a major change from its predecessor, the F-4J.<ref name="Jenkins"/>  Other squadrons that switched to F/A-18 are VFA-146 "Blue diamonds", and VFA-147 "Argonauts".  In January 1985, the VFA-131 Wildcats moved from Naval Air Station Lemoore to Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida, and became the Atlantic Fleet’s first F/A-18 squadron.

thumb|right|The [[Blue Angels' #6 F/A-18A.]]

The US Navy's aerobatic team switched to the F/A-18 Hornet in 1986,<ref name="BoeingMilestones"/> when it replaced the VIPs, but can also fill in for other aircraft in the squadron in a normal show if the need arises.

====Into combat====

The F/A-18 first saw combat action in April 1986, when VFA-131 Hornets from USS ''Coral Sea'' flew SEAD missions against Libyan air defenses during Operation Prairie Fire and an attack on Benghazi as part of Operation El Dorado Canyon.<ref name="Jenkins">Jenkins 2000.</ref>

During the first North Persian Gulf after a successful mission to Iraq.

F/A-18 pilots were credited with two kills during the Gulf War, both MiG-21s.<ref> Miller, David. ''The Illustrated Directory of Modern Weapons''. St. Paul, Minnesota: MBI Publishing Company, 2002. ISBN 0-7603-1346-6.</ref> On the first day of the war, U.S. Navy pilots Lieutenant Nick Mongilio and Lieutenant Commander (now Rear Admiral) Mark Fox were sent from the USS ''Saratoga'' in the Red Sea to bomb an airfield in southwestern Iraq.  While enroute, they were warned by an E-2C of approaching MiG-21 aircraft. The Hornets shot down two MiGs and resumed their bombing run, each carrying four 2,000 lb bombs, before returning to ''Saratoga''.  Mongilio and Fox become the first pilots to register air-to-air kills while still completing their original air-to-ground mission.<ref name="BoeingMilestones"/><ref name=FedAmSci/>  The Hornet's survivability was demonstrated when a Hornet took hits in both engines and flew  back to base.  It was repaired and flying within a few days.  Overall during the Gulf War, F/A-18s flew 4,551 sorties with ten Hornets damaged including the two losses previously mentioned.<ref name="Jenkins_p72">Jenkins 2000, p. 72.</ref>

As the A-6 Intruder was retired in the 1990s, its role was filled by the F/A-18. The F/A-18 demonstrated its versatility and reliability during Operation Desert Storm, shooting down enemy fighters and subsequently bombing enemy targets with the same aircraft on the same mission. It broke records for tactical aircraft in availability, reliability, and maintainability.

Both U.S. Navy F/A-18A/C models and Marine F/A-18A/C/D models were used continuously in Operation Southern Watch and over Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s. U.S. Navy Hornets flew in Operation Enduring Freedom from carriers operating in the North Arabian Sea. Both the F/A-18A/C and newer F/A-18E/F variants were used in Operation Iraqi Freedom, operating from aircraft carriers. Later in the conflict USMC A+, C, and primarily D models operated from bases within Iraq. An F/A-18C was accidentally downed in a Friendly Fire incident by a Patriot missile early in the conflict, and two others collided over Iraq in May 2005. In January 2007, two Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets collided in mid-air and crashed in the Persian Gulf.[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/07/world/main3683082.shtml]  On June 13, 2008, an F/A-18C Hornet collided with an F-5 Tiger over northern Nevada's high desert, killing its pilot. Both pilots of the F-5 were injured, but managed to parachute to safety.<ref>Associated Press.

===Non-US service===

Though Navy aircraft have not historically sold well on the export market, the F/A-18 has been purchased and is in operation with a number of foreign air services. Export Hornets are typically similar to U.S. models of a similar manufacture date. Since none of the customers operate aircraft carriers, all export models have been sold without the automatic carrier landing system, and Australia further removed the catapult attachment on the nose gear.<ref name="Jenkins"/>  Except for Canada, all export customers purchased their Hornets through the U.S. Navy, via the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Program, where the Navy acts as the purchasing manager but incurs no financial gain or loss. Canada ordered its planes directly from the manufacturer.

====Australia====

The Royal Australian Air Force purchased 57 F/A-18A fighters and 18 F/A-18B two-seat trainers, with 71 in service, and 4 lost to crashes.<ref>{{cite web | last = Crick | first = Darren  | coauthors =

In 2001, Australia deployed four aircraft to 75 Squadron deployed 14 F/A-18s to Qatar as part of Operation Falconer.

====Canada====
right|thumb|[[Canadian CF-18A Hornet off the coast of Hawaii.  Note the 'false cockpit' painted on the underside of the aircraft, intended to confuse enemy pilots during dogfights.]]

Canada was the first export customer for the Hornet, replacing the CF-104 Starfighter (air recce & strike, Germany), the CF-101 Voodoo (air interception, Canada) and the CF-116 Freedom Fighter (ground attack, Canada).  The CF-188A/CF-18A) and 40 B models (designation CF-188B/CF-18B).  

In 1991, Canada committed 26 CF-18s to the Gulf War, based in Qatar. In June 1999, with 18 CF-18s were deployed to Aviano AB, Italy, and they participated in both the air-to-ground and air-to-air roles in the former Yugoslavia.

The fighters are undergoing an avionics and structural upgrade program to extend service to 2020,<ref name="Jenkins"/> upgrading F-18A and F-18B to F/A-18C and D standard. A total of 80 CF-18s, consisting of 62 single-seat and 18 dual-seat models were selected from the fleet for the upgrade program.  As of 2003, Canada has 123 in service with 15 losses.<ref name="Senior">Senior, Tim. ''F/A-18 Hornet, The AirForces Monthly book of'', AirForces Monthly, 2003. ISBN 0-946219-69-9.</ref>

====Finland====

The Finnish Air Force (''Suomen Ilmavoimat'') has 63 F-18C/Ds. Delivery started on June 7 1995. One fighter was destroyed in a mid-air collision in 2001.<ref name="BoeingMilestones"/>

The Finnish F-18C includes the ASPJ (Airborne-Self-Protection-Jammer) jamming Pod ALQ-165 that was cancelled on original US Navy orders. The US Navy later included the ALQ-165 on their Super Hornet (F-18E/F) procurement. The Finnish Hornets were initially to be used only for air defense, however, their electronics suite allows them to take on air-to-ground roles.

====Kuwait====
The Kuwait Air Force (''Al Quwwat Aj Jawwaiya Al Kuwaitiya'')] has 32 F/A-18C and F/A-18D Hornets.<ref name="Senior"/>  These aircraft were pre-ordered before the Iraqi invasion of August 1990.  Delivery of the fighters started on 8 October 1991.<ref name="BoeingMilestones"/>  The F/A-18C/Ds replaced A-4KU Skyhawk.

====Malaysia====
The Royal Malaysian Air Force (''Tentera Udara Diraja Malaysia'') has eight F/A-18Ds.<ref name="Boeing1997"></ref>

====Spain====
thumb|right|[[Spain|Spanish EF-18.]]

The Spanish Air Force (Ejercito del Aire) ordered 60 EF-18A model and 12 EF-18B model Hornets (the "E" standing for "España", Spain), named respectively as C.15 and CE.15 by Spanish AF.<ref name="Senior"/>  Delivery of the Spanish version started on November 22 1985.<ref name="BoeingMilestones"/> Currently all of these planes have been upgraded to F-18A+/B+ standard, close to F/A-18C/D (plus version includes later mission and armament computers, databuses, data-storage set, new wiring, pylon modifications and software, new capabilities as AN/AAS-38B NITE Hawk targeting FLIR pods). 

In 1995 Spain obtained 24 ex-USN F/A-18A Hornets, with six more on option.  The first six were delivered in December 1995.  Prior to delivery, they were modified with F404 engines and other Spanish-specified modifications. This was the first sale of USN surplus Hornets.
