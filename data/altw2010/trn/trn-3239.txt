'''Quebec''' ( or ), in French, '''''Québec''''' (<ref name="EFname"/>) is a province in the central part of French-speaking population and the only one whose sole French at the provincial level. Other elements of French tradition, such as the civil law legal system, also remain strong in Quebec.

Nationalism plays a large role in the politics of the province, with all three major provincial political parties seeking greater autonomy and recognition of the Quebec people as a nation.<ref></ref> Sovereigntist governments held referendums on independence in 1980 and 1995, and the symbolic motion recognizing the "Québécois as a nation within Canada".<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Quebec is administrative division; only the territory of Nunavut is larger. It is bordered to the west by the province of Ontario, James Bay and Hudson Bay, to the north by Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay, to the east by the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick. It is bordered on the south by the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York.  It also shares maritime borders with Nunavut, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. 

Quebec is the second most populated province, behind Ontario. Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the English-speaking communities and English-language institutions are concentrated in Montreal but are also significantly present in the Aboriginal peoples.

While the province's substantial natural resources have long been the mainstay of its economy, sectors of the knowledge economy such as aerospace, information and communication technologies, biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industry also play leading roles.<ref></ref>

==Etymology and boundary changes==
left|thumb|150px|[[Samuel de Champlain, Father of New France]]
The name "Quebec", which comes from the Algonquin word '''kepék''' meaning "(it) narrows", originally referred to the area around Quebec City where the Saint Lawrence River narrows to a cliff-lined gap. Early variations in the spelling of the name included ''Québecq'' (Levasseur, 1601) and ''Kébec'' (Lescarbot 1609).<ref>Afable, Patricia O. and Madison S. Beeler (1996). "Place Names". In "Languages", ed. Ives Goddard. Vol. 17 of ''Handbook of North American Indians'', ed. William C. Sturtevant. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 191</ref> French explorer Samuel de Champlain chose the name ''Québec'' in 1608 for the colonial outpost he would use as the administrative seat for the French colony of New France.<ref></ref>

The Province of Quebec was founded in the Treaty of Paris formally transferred the French colony of Canada<ref>"his Most Christian Majesty cedes and guaranties to his said Britannick Majesty, in full right, Canada, with all its dependencies, as well as the island of Cape Breton, and all the other islands and coasts in the gulph and river of St. Lawrence, and in general, every thing that depends on the said countries, lands, islands, and coasts, with the sovereignty, property, possession, and all rights acquired by treaty, or otherwise, which the Most Christian King and the Crown of France have had till now over the said countries, lands, islands, places, coasts, and their inhabitants" – [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_%281763%29 ''Treaty of Paris''], 1763</ref> to Britain after the Confederation in 1867. Each became one of the first four provinces. 

In 1870, Canada purchased Library of the Parliament of Canada, [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp412-e.htm#B].</ref> In 1898, the Canadian Parliament passed the first Quebec Boundary Extension Act that expanded the provincial boundaries northward to include the lands of the Quebec Boundaries Extension Act of 1912 that added the northernmost lands of the aboriginal officially disputes this boundary.

== Geography ==

right|200px|thumb|Map of Quebec.

The province occupies a vast territory (nearly three times the size of Mont D'Iberville, located on the border with Newfoundland and Labrador in the northeastern part of the province.

The Saint Lawrence River is one of the worlds largest sustaining large inland Atlantic ports at Montreal (the province's largest city), French exploration and settlement in the 17th and 18th centuries. Since 1959, the Lower Saint Lawrence (''Bas-Saint-Laurent''), Lower North Shore (''Côte-Nord''), and Gaspé (Gaspésie) regions of the province.

More than 90% of Quebec's territory lies within the pulp and paper and Cree, Radisson to service the massive Laurentians, a mountain range just north of Montreal and Quebec City that attracts local and international tourists to ski hills and lakeside resorts.

The Beauce region, and on to the Gaspé Peninsula, where they disappear into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This region sustains a mix of forestry, industry, and tourism based on its natural resources and landscape.

===Climate===
Quebec has three main climate regions. Southern and western Quebec, including most of the major population centres, have a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification ''Dfb'') with warm, humid summers and long, cold winters. The main climatic influences are from western and northern Canada which move eastward and from the southern and central United States that move northward. Because of the influence of both storm systems from the core of North America and the Atlantic Ocean, precipitation is abundant throughout the year, with most areas receiving more than 100&nbsp;centimetres(40 in) of precipitation, including over 300&nbsp;centimetres (120 in) of snow in many areas. During the summer, severe weather patterns (such as tornadoes and severe thunderstorms) occasionally occur.

Most of central Quebec has a subarctic climate (Köppen ''Dfc''). Winters are long and among the coldest in eastern Canada, while summers are warm but very short because of the higher latitude and the greater influence of Arctic air masses. Precipitation is also somewhat less than farther south, except at some of the higher elevations.

The northern regions of Quebec have an arctic climate (Köppen ''ET''), with very cold winters and short, much cooler summers. The primary influences in this region are the Arctic Ocean currents (such as the Labrador Current) and continental air masses from the High Arctic.

==History==

===First Nations===
At the time of first European contact and later colonization, Algonquian, Iroquoian and Abenaki). St. Lawrence Iroquoians lived more settled lives, planting squash and maize in the fertile soils of St. Lawrence Valley. The Inuit continue to fish and hunt whale and seal in the harsh Arctic climate along the coasts of Hudson and Ungava Bay. These people traded fur and food and sometimes warred with each other.

===Early European exploration===
Basque whalers and fishermen traded furs with Saguenay natives throughout the 16th century.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0000550 Basques], The Canadian Encyclopedia</ref>

The first French explorer to reach Quebec was Jacques Cartier, who planted a cross in 1534 at either Gaspé or at Old Fort Bay on the Lower North Shore. He sailed into the St. Lawrence River in 1535 and established an ill-fated colony near present-day Quebec City at the site of Stadacona, an Iroquoian village.

===New France===

Samuel de Champlain was part of a 1603 expedition from France that travelled into the St. Lawrence River. In 1608, he returned as head of an exploration party and founded Quebec City with the intention of making the area part of the French colonial empire. Champlain's ''Habitation de Quebec'', built as a permanent fur trading outpost, was where he would forge a trading, and ultimately a military alliance, with the Algonquin and Huron nations. Natives traded their furs for many French goods such as metal objects, guns, alcohol, and clothing.

Hélène Desportes, born July 7, 1620, to the French European descent born in Quebec.

From Quebec, voyageurs and Catholic missionaries used river Radisson and Groseilliers 1659–60), La Salle 1682), as well as the de la Verendrye 1734–1738). 

After 1627, King seigneurial system and forbade settlement in Trois-Rivières (Laviolette) and Montréal or Ville-Marie (Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve and Jeanne Mance) to convert New France's Huron and Algonkian allies to Catholicism. The seigneurial system of governing New France also encouraged immigration from the motherland.

New France became a Royal Province in 1663 under King Sovereign Council that included intendant settlement and colonization in New France, including the arrival of les "Filles du Roi". The population grew from about 3,000 to 60,000 people between 1666 and 1760.<ref>[http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/98-187-XIE/pop.htm Estimated population of Canada, 1605 to present]</ref> Colonists built farms on the banks of St. Lawrence River and called themselves "Canadiens" or "Habitants". The colony's total population was limited, however, by a winter climate significantly harsher than that found in France; by the spread of diseases; and by the refusal of the French crown to allow Huguenots, or French Protestants, to settle there. The population of New France lagged far behind that of the Thirteen Colonies to the south, leaving it vulnerable to attack.

===Conquest of New France===
In 1753 France began building a series of forts in the British Pittsburgh) in the Ohio Valley in an attempt to enforce the British claim to the territory. This frontier battle set the stage for the British mounted an attack on New France by sea and took the French fort at Louisbourg. 

On Province of Quebec.

In 1774, fearful that the French-speaking population of Quebec (as the colony was called) would side with the rebels of the Thirteen Colonies to the south, the British Parliament passed the Guy Carleton, played an important role in convincing London to drop the assimilation scheme, but the looming American revolt was certainly a factor. Through the Quebec Act, the Quebec people obtained their first Charter of Rights, which paved the way to later official recognition of the French language and civil law and sanctioned freedom of religion, allowing the Roman Catholic Church to remain. It also restored the Ohio Valley to Quebec, reserving the territory for the fur trade.

The act, designed to placate one North American colony, had the opposite effect among its neighbors to the south. The Quebec Act was among the 1775 invasion by the American battle at Quebec City.

===Revolutionary War===
When the American army came to Quebec they found many sympathetic supporters. According to Baby, Tachereau and Williams, as many as 747 people in Quebec took up active service with the Americans, most notably Clément Gosselin of the 2nd Canadian Regiment.

The 2nd Canadian Regiment fought at the Battle of Brandywine in 1777. The 1st Canadian Regiment under James Livingston served at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777.

At the end of the war, 50,000 Loyalists came to Canada and settled amongst a population of 90,000 French people. 

The American Revolutionary War was ultimately successful in winning independence for the Thirteen Colonies. In the Treaty of Paris (1783), the British ceded their territory south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States of America.

===''Patriotes''' Rebellion in Lower and Upper Canada===

Like their counterparts in Upper Canada, in 1837 English and French speaking residents of Lower Canada, led by Louis-Joseph Papineau and Robert Nelson, formed an armed resistance group to seek an end to British colonial rule. They made a Declaration of Rights with equality for all citizens without discrimination and a Declaration of Independence in 1838. Their actions resulted in rebellions in both Lower and Upper Canada. An unprepared British Army had to raise a local militia force, and the rebel forces were soon defeated after having scored a victory in Saint-Denis, Quebec, east of Montreal. The British army also burned the Church of St-Eustache, killing the rebels who were hiding within it.  The bullet and cannonball marks on the walls of the church are still visible to this day.

=== Act of Union ===
After the rebellions, Lord Durham was asked to undertake a study and prepare a report on the matter and to offer a solution for the British Parliament to assess.

The final report recommended that the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada be united, and that the French speaking population of Lower Canada be assimilated into British culture. Following Durham's Report, the British government merged the two colonial provinces into one Act of Union.

However, the political union proved contentious. Reformers in both Canada West (formerly Upper Canada) and Canada East (formerly Lower Canada) worked to repeal limitations on the use of the French language in the Legislature. The two colonies remained distinct in administration, election, and law.

In 1848, Baldwin and LaFontaine, allies and leaders of the Reformist party, were asked by Lord Elgin to form an administration together under the new policy of responsible government.  The French language subsequently regained legal status in the Legislature.

=== Canadian Confederation ===
In the 1860s, the delegates from the colonies of British North America (Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland) met in a series of conferences to discuss self-governing status for a new confederation.

The first Quebec Conference in Quebec City which led to a delegation going to London, England, to put forth a proposal for a national union.

As a result of those deliberations, in 1867 the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the British North America Act, providing for the Confederation of most of these provinces.

The former Province of Canada was divided into its two previous parts as the provinces of Ontario (Upper Canada) and Quebec (Lower Canada).
* Dominion of Canada.
* Prince Edward Island joined in 1873 and the Dominion of Newfoundland entered the Confederation in 1949.

===Quiet Revolution===

The conservative government of Union Nationale dominated Quebec politics from 1944 to 1960 with the support of the Liberals. The Quiet Revolution was a period of dramatic social and political change that saw the decline of Anglo supremacy in the Quebec economy, the decline of the Roman Catholic Church's influence, the pro-sovereignty movement under former Liberal minister René Lévesque.

Beginning in 1963, a terrorist group that became known as the Bourassa will have to face reality; 100,000 revolutionary workers, armed and organized."

At the request of Premier Robert Bourassa, Prime Minister Minister of Justice of Canada, reported that 497 persons had been arrested throughout Canada under the War Measures Act,<ref>Susan Munroe, [http://canadaonline.about.com/cs/octobercrisis/a/octobercrisistl.htm October Crisis Timeline], Canada Online. Retrieved 21 January 2008.</ref> of whom 435 had been released. The other 62 were charged, of which 32 were crimes of such seriousness that a Quebec Superior Court judge refused them bail. The crisis ended a few weeks after the death of Pierre Laporte at the hands of his captors. The fallout of the crisis marked the zenith and twilight of the FLQ which lost membership and public support. 

In 1977, the newly elected Parti Québécois government of René Lévesque introduced the Charter of the French Language. Often known as Bill 101, it defined French as the only official language of Quebec in areas of provincial jurisdiction.

===Parti Québécois and constitutional crisis===
Lévesque and his party had run in the 1970 and 1973 Quebec elections under a platform of separating Quebec from the rest of Canada. The party failed to win control of Quebec's National Assembly both times — though its share of the vote increased from 23% to 30% — and Lévesque was defeated both times in the riding he contested. In the 1976 election, he softened his message by promising a referendum (plebiscite) on sovereignty-association rather than outright separation, by which Quebec would have independence in most government functions but share some other ones, such as a common currency, with Canada. On November 15, 1976, Lévesque and the Parti Québécois won control of the provincial government for the first time. The question of sovereignty-association was placed before the voters in the 1980 Quebec referendum. During the campaign, Pierre Trudeau promised that a vote for the "no" side was a vote for reforming Canada. Trudeau advocated the patriation of Canada's Constitution from the United Kingdom. The existing constitutional document, the British North America Act, could only be amended by the United Kingdom Parliament upon a request by the Canadian parliament.

Sixty percent of the Quebec electorate voted against the proposition. Polls showed that the overwhelming majority of English and immigrant Quebecers voted against, and that French Quebecers were almost equally divided, with older voters less in favour and younger voters more in favour. After his loss in the referendum, Lévesque went back to Ottawa to start negotiating a new constitution with Trudeau, his minister of Justice Jean Chrétien and the nine other provincial premiers. Lévesque insisted Quebec be able to veto any future constitutional amendments. The negotiations quickly reached a stand-still. 

Then on the night of "Kitchen Accord") Federal Justice Minister Jean Chrétien<!--not PM Trudeau, as erroneously reported here before. PM Trudeau had simply pointed out to the provinces that had held out with Lévesque that he had been individually negotiating with Lévesque, against the terms of the agreement between all the hold-out provinces--> met with all of the provincial premiers except René Lévesque to sign the document that would eventually become the new Canadian constitution. The next morning, they presented the "fait accompli" to Lévesque. Lévesque refused to sign the document and returned to Quebec. In 1982, Trudeau had the new constitution approved by the British Parliament, with Quebec's signature still missing (a situation that persists to this day). The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed Trudeau's assertion that every province's approval is not required to amend the constitution.

In subsequent years, two attempts were made to gain Quebec's approval of the constitution. The first was the Newfoundland premier Quebec Liberal Party that led to the formation of the new Action Démocratique (Democratic Action) party led by Mario Dumont and Jean Allaire.

On second referendum on sovereignty took place. This time, it was rejected by a slim majority (50.6% NO to 49.4% YES); a clear majority of French-speaking Quebecers voted in favour of sovereignty.

The referendum was enshrouded in controversy. Federalists complained that an unusually high number of ballots had been rejected in pro-federalist areas, notably in the largely Jewish and Greek riding of Chomedey (11.7 % or 5,500 of its ballots were spoiled, compared to 750 or 1.7% in the general election of 1994) although Quebec's chief electoral officer found no evidence of outright fraud. The federal government was accused of not respecting provincial laws with regard to spending during referendums (leading to a corruption scandal that would become public a decade later, greatly damaging the Liberal Party's standing), and of having accelerated the naturalization of immigrants in Quebec before the referendum in order that they could vote, as naturalized citizens were believed more likely to vote no. (43,850 immigrants were naturalized in 1995, whereas the average number between 1988 and 1998 was 21,733.)

The same night of the referendum, an angry Jacques Parizeau, then premier and leader of the "Yes" side, declared that the loss was because of "money and the ethnic vote". Parizeau resigned over public outrage and as per his commitment to do so in case of a loss. Lucien Bouchard became Quebec's new premier in his place.

Federalists accused the sovereignist side of asking a vague, overly complicated question on the ballot. Its English text read as follows:
<blockquote>
''Do you agree that Québec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of Québec and of the agreement signed on June 12, 1995?''
</blockquote>
After winning the next election, Bouchard retired from politics in 2001. Quebec Liberal Party and 2007 general election and the Parti Québécois becoming the third opposition party, behind the Action Démocratique. The PQ has promised to hold another referendum should it return to government.

===Quebec as a nation===
Given the province's heritage and the preponderance of French (unique among the Canadian provinces), there is an ongoing debate in Canada regarding the status of Quebec and its people (wholly or partially).  Prior attempts to amend the Canadian constitution to acknowledge Quebec as a 'Prime Minister Jean Chrétien would later endorse recognition of Quebec as a "unique society"[http://www.exec.gov.nl.ca/currentevents/unity/unityr1.htm].  On October 30, 2003, the National Assembly of Quebec voted unanimously to affirm "that the Quebecers form a nation".<ref></ref>
On House of Commons passed a motion moved by Prime Minister Stephen Harper declaring that "this House recognize[s] that the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada."<ref>[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=hansard&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1&DocId=2544166&File=0#SOB-1798651 Hansard; 39th Parliament, 1st Session; No. 087; November 27, 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061128.wnation28/BNStory/National/home Galloway, Gloria; Curry, Bill; Dobrota, Alex; ''Globe and Mail'': 'Nation' motion passes, but costs Harper; November 28, 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061127.wchong1127/BNStory/National Bonoguore, Tenille; Sallot, Jeff; ''Globe and Mail'': Harper's Quebec motion passes easily; November 27, 2006]</ref> However, there is considerable debate and uncertainty over what this means.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

==Demographics==

Quebec's fertility rate is lower than the Canadian average. At 1.52, it is slightly below the Canada-wide rate of 1.54<ref>http://cansim2.statcan.ca/cgi-win/CNSMCGI.PGM</ref> and well below the replacement fertility rate of 2.1. This contrasts with fertility rates before 1960, which were among the highest of any industrialized society. Although Quebec is home to only 23.9% of the population of Canada, the number of international adoptions in Quebec is the highest of all provinces of Canada. In 2001, 42% of international adoptions in Canada were carried out in Quebec.

===Aboriginal status===
The 2006 census counted a total aboriginal population of 108,425 (1.5%) including 65,085 North American Indians (0.9%), 27,985 Métis (0.4%), and 10,950 Inuit (0.15%). It should be noted however, that there is a significant undercount, as many of the biggest Indian bands regularly refuse to participate in Canadian censuses for political reasons regarding the question of aboriginal sovereignty. In particular, the largest Mohawk Iroquois reserves (Kahnawake, Akwesasne and Kanesatake) were not counted.
