'''Hungaroring''' on moottoriurheilurata lähellä rautaesiripun toisella puolella.

Hungaroringin radalla ohittaminen on vaikeaa, koska siellä ei ole pitkien suorien päässä juurikaan tiukkoja mutkia. Rataa on muutettu pariin kertaan, ensimmäisen kerran vuonna 1989. Silloin shikaani kolmannen mutkan jälkeen poistettiin. Vuonna 2003 pääsuoran jälkeistä mutkaa siirrettiin 200 metriä kauemmas, ja siitä tehtiin entistä terävämpi, jotta ohitus olisi helpompaa.

Sää voi muuttaa tylsänkin kilpailun mielenkiintoiseksi. Unkarin GP 2006 oli radan ensimmäinen sadekisa. Siitä seurasi tapahtumarikas ja jännittävä kilpailu, jossa nähtiin useita keskeytyksiä, mukaan luettuna maailmanmestaruudesta taistelevat Fernando Alonso ja Michael Schumacher. Kisan päätteeksi Jenson Button otti ensimmäisen voittonsa 113. GP:ssään.

Erityisesti suomalaiset fanit suosivat Unkarin GP:tä. Se on lähimpänä Suomea, siellä suomalaiset ovat menestyneet hyvin, ja suomen ja unkarin kielet kuuluvat samaan kielikuntaan.

The '''Hungaroring''' is a Grand Prix behind the Hungarian friend of his recommended Hungarian who won motorcycle GP races. According to a survey put together by the Hungarian national tourism office Mogyoród ranks third in venues visited by tourists in Hungary, following the Danube Bend-area and Lake Balaton, but before Budapest<ref name="AmCham"></ref>.

==Description==
Held in the middle of a Grand Prix calendar that saw its first wet race in the 2006 season. The circuit is generally dusty due to underuse throughout the season and being built on sandy soil. The track's being in a natural valley means that about 80 percent of the racetrack is visible from any point<ref></ref>. 

Normally an underused circuit becomes faster over the weekend as the track rubbers in; however, with the Hungaroring this generally does not happen because the track can get dusty so quickly. This is a circuit where there is often a heightened advantage to running late in qualifying.

With tight and twisting corners, some of the most exciting races in F1 history have been held here<ref name="CNN"/>, although these were nearly always wet races. Due to the twisty style of the circuit<ref></ref> overtaking is difficult in dry conditions. Nonetheless, the Hungaroring has been the scene of several memorable races such as the duels of Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna, Nigel Mansell's lost wheel in 1987, Mansell's win from 12th on the grid in 1989, Damon Hill's race with an Arrows in 1997, maiden wins for Fernando Alonso in 2003 and Jenson Button in 2006 in the track's first ever wet grand prix, and others.

==Drivers== 
Hungaroring has crowned two drivers in its 20 year history: both Nigel Mansell in 1992 and Michael Schumacher in 2001 were able to win the World Championship title at early points of the seasons. Moreover, both Hungary's Zsolt Baumgartner and Poland's Robert Kubica made their debut on this track as the first F1 drivers of their countries. The WilliamsF1 Team also secured the Constructors' Championship at the Hungaroring in 1996.

The 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix was the first wet grand prix at the Hungaroring. This saw the retirement of many drivers including championship rivals Fernando Alonso and Michael Schumacher and gave Jenson Button and the reborn Honda F1 team their first win. Fernando Alonso also earned his first Grand Prix victory at this in 2003, declaring it his favorite track as a result.

According to statements and interviews, drivers have different opinions on the track. While many like Ayrton Senna, Nigel Mansell, Michael Schumacher, and Fernando Alonso claimed to love it, many others consider the track, and the Hungarian Grand Prix too slow, hot and demanding.
The technical driving center of the Hungaroring held former racer Gerhard Berger's name from 1998 until 2005 but later it was changed to Allianz.

The track also has a curve named after Nigel Mansell.

==Fans==
While most of the foreign fans are from Finnish fans as well. With the loss of the Austrian Grand Prix, this is the closest Formula One event for fans from other Central European countries. The 2006 race saw many spectators from Poland due to the debut of their first Formula 1 driver, Robert Kubica.
