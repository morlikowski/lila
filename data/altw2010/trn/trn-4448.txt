'''Miryang''', often spelled '''Milyang''', is a city in Gyeongsangnam-do Province, South Korea.  Neighboring cities include Changnyeong to the west, Cheongdo to the north, Ulsan to the east, and Yangsan, Gimhae, and Changwon to the south.  The city bird is the Korean magpie, the city tree is the pine, and the city flower is the royal azalea.    

The recorded history of Miryang begins in the Samhan period, when it was known as Mirimidongguk.  Due to its strategic location near the Nakdong River, Miryang played an important role from the Silla period forward.  It served as an important station on the Great Yeongnam Road during the later Joseon Dynasty, and in the 20th century it became a station on the Gyeongbu Line railroad that connects Busan to Seoul.  Miryang remains a key stop along that line, and is now the only city between Busan and Daegu served by KTX express trains.

Miryang is known around Korea for the Miryang ''Neo-Confucian scholar Arang.

==Geography and climate==
thumb|right|Miryang city centre as seen from across the Miryang River.
Miryang's geography is heavily influenced by the two rivers which flow through it, the Miryang and Nakdong Rivers.  All of Miryang lies within the Nakdong basin, and the Nakdong River itself runs along Miryang's southern border.  The city's topography generally slopes from the high peaks of the Yeongnam Alps in the northeast to the Nakdong valley in the southwest.  Much of the city is drained by the Miryang River, which rises in western Ulsan and flows through the city center to join the Nakdong at Samnangjin.  Portions are drained by other Nakdong tributaries, including the Naejincheon.

The Miryang River valley south of the city center broadens into a fertile plain.  This area, including large portions of Samnangjin-eup, Sangnam-myeon, and Hanam-eup, serves as a local breadbasket and is almost entirely devoted to rice-farming.  In Hanam-eup, it oins another plain running along the Nakdong.

As elsewhere in the Yeongnam region, the landscape is very lumpy, with many craggy hills and low mountains.  The highest mountain in Miryang is Gajisan (1240 m), which stands on the northern border.  Other high peaks along the border include Hwaaksan and Jaeyaksan.  These peaks are part of the Yeongnam Alps, a branch of the Taebaek Mountains.  

Further south, the mountains are lower but still quite frequent.  Notable peaks in this area include drinking purposes.  Some of the larger reservoirs in Miryang include Miryang Lake and Antae Lake.

===Climate===
Like most of the rest of South Korea, Miryang enjoys a relatively mild temperate climate.  The average windspeed is about 1.4 m/s, the average temperature 14.4 C, and the annual rainfall in 2004 was 1,377.40 mm.<ref>"5. 기상개황" in Miryang City (2005).  Retrieved September 26 2006 from [http://cal.miryang.go.kr/view.asp?t_idx=18]</ref>

The mountains along its north flank afford Miryang a measure of shelter from heavy winds and other severe weather coming from the north.  On the other hand, it is relatively vulnerable to damage from tropical storms encroaching from the south.

The Miryang and Nakdong valleys are subject to frequent floods during monsoon season.  Other natural disasters are uncommon.<ref></ref>

==History==
During the King Gyeongdeok in the 8th century, the name was changed to "Milseong-gun"  (密城郡).  

In the ''ju'', Mil-ju, by King Seongjong.  In 1194, Miryang was the site of a massive battle between royal forces and a massive rebel army led by King Chungnyeol in the late 13th century, local residents led by King Gongyang, it was raised to the status of a ''bu''.  

With the dawn of the Joseon period (1392-1910), Miryang first became known by its modern name.  Initially demoted from ''bu'' to ''gun'' (county) by King Taejo, it was then raised back to ''bu'' and its name changed from "Milseong" to "Miryang."  Under Taejo's son King Taejong, it was once again demoted to ''gun''.  Later it became a ''dohobu'', or military protectorate, and in 1895 it became a ''gun'' once again; it was to carry this status until late in the 20th century.

Under Japanese rule, Miryang was the site of various clashes between  the Korean independence movement and the occupation forces.  During the March First Movement of 1919, approximately 13,500 Miryang residents took part in peaceful demonstrations in support of Korean independence.  This led to the "Miryang massacre," in which 150 Korean civilians were shot by occupation troops.<ref>"밀양학살사건" (Miryang haksal sageon, Miryang massacre incident) in Lee (1983), p. 456.</ref>  In November 1920, independence fighter Choe Su-bong built and detonated two bombs at the Miryang police station, destroying the structure.  He attempted to kill himself but was unsuccessful; later he was put to death and his accomplices were imprisoned.<ref>"밀양경찰서 폭파사건" (Miryang gyeongchalseo pokpa sageon, Miryang police station bombing incident) in Lee (1983), p. 455.</ref> 

In 1989 the city center was separated from the rest of Miryang and named "Miryang-si" (Miryang City).  In 1995 the city center was reunited with the hinterland and the entire region became known as Miryang-si.  Both of these were part of general reorganizations of South Korean local government.

==Administrative divisions==
Miryang is divided into 16 primary divisions, of which 2 are ''eup'' (large villages), 5 are ''dong'' (city precincts), and 9 are ''myeon'' (rural areas).   Some of the ''dong'' are further subdivided, so that the city center is composed of eight legal ''dong'' in total.  The ''eup'' and ''myeon'' are broken into ''ri'', of which Miryang has a total of 265 administrative or 119 legal.
