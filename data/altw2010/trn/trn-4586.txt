Eine '''Brücke über die Straße von Messina''' (italienisch ''Ponte sullo Stretto di Messina'') soll eines Tages die E 45 / A 1''' mit dem italienischen Festland verbinden. Der Bau einer solchen Brücke war in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten mehrmals diskutiert worden. Sie ist auch Bestandteil des TEN-Projektes Nr. 1.

== Jüngstes Projekt ==
Im Oktober 2005 erhielt ein Konsortium um den norditalienischen Baukonzern Impregilo S.p.A. den Zuschlag mit einem Auftragsvolumen von 3,9 Milliarden Euro. Der Baubeginn war für 2007 angesetzt worden.

Im Falle einer Fertigstellung wäre die Brücke mit einer Hauptspannweite von 3300 Metern, einer Gesamtlänge von 3666 Metern und einer Pfeilerhöhe von 382,60 Metern die längste und höchste Hängebrücke der Welt.

Die Brücke soll den Fährbetrieb zwischen A3 (Kalabrien) und A18, bzw. A20 (beide Sizilien) ermöglicht.

Am 11. Oktober 2006 beschloss die italienische Abgeordnetenkammer die Durchführung des Projekts auszusetzen. Besonders Verkehrsminister Alessandro Bianchi und Umweltminister Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, die seit dem 17. Mai 2006 unter Ministerpräsident Romano Prodi im Amt sind, hatten das Projekt als unsinnig und umweltschädigend kritisiert.

Die Größe und die Kosten der Brücke seien wegen der schwachen Infrastruktur Siziliens unangemessen. Es sei wirkungsvoller und kostengünstiger, zunächst die Infrastruktur der Insel zu verbessern und die Modernisierung und den Ausbau der Verkehrswege in Süditalien zu beschleunigen.

Durch den Bau der Brücke würden schützenswerte Gebiete auf beiden Seiten der Meerenge zerstört. Weiters bestehe die Gefahr, dass das Bauprojekt durch das organisierte Verbrechen unterwandert werde.

Die umstrittenen Pläne werden seit der Wiederwahl Silvio Berlusconis im April 2008 erneut vorangetrieben. Im Mai 2010 soll der Grundstein gelegt werden. Die Fertigstellung des Brückenbaus ist für 2016 geplant.

Construction was to begin in largest suspension bridge in the world, doubling the main span of the Akashi-Kaikyo. While the bridge had been planned for many decades, the idea for a bridge has been around since Roman times. A design for a restrained buoyant submarine tube tunnel, that would have been anchored to the seabed, was submitted  by British  engineer Alan Grant in an international competition  promoted by the Italian government in 1970. This was awarded one of six equal first prizes.

Two ministers of the government of Romano Prodi (18 May 2006) stated their opposition to the project when taking up office. As of August 2006, the project was announced as "under review" for budgetary reasons. Citing concerns that the project was too expensive, was likely to enrich criminal gangs, and might not be earthquake-proof, the project was terminated in October 2006, over protests from southern Italian legislators.

== 2006 plan ==
The 2006 plan called for a single-span suspension bridge with a central span of 3,300&nbsp;m (about 2&nbsp;largest suspension bridge in the world at 1,991&nbsp;metres).

Plans called for six traffic lanes (two driving lanes and one emergency lane in each direction), two railway tracks and two pedestrian lanes.  In order to provide a minimum vertical clearance for navigation of 65&nbsp;metres, the height of the two towers was to be 382.6&nbsp;metres.  This would have been taller than the Millau Viaduct in France (currently the tallest bridge in the world at 341 metres).  The bridge's suspension system would have relied on two pairs of steel cables, each with a diameter of 1.24&nbsp;metres and a total length, between the anchor blocks, of 5,300&nbsp;metres.

The design included 20.3&nbsp;km of road links and 19.8&nbsp;km of railway links to the bridge. On the mainland, the bridge was to connect to the new stretch of the High-Speed railway line; on the Sicilian side, to the Messina-Catania (A18) and Messina-Palermo (A20) motorways as well as the new Messina railway station (to be built by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana).

Geographically, the bridge was planned to connect Messina, the two cities which face each other on either side of the strait, and form a single city. This ambitious urban project was called ''Area Metropolitana integrata dello Stretto (Integrated Metropolitan Area of the Strait)'' or simply ''Città dello Stretto (City of the Strait)''.  Among the controversies surrounding the building of the bridge was strong opposition to the formation of the new city by various Sicilian nationalist groups.

A construction € 4.6 billion.

On October 12, 2006, the Italian Parliament voted 272 to 232 in favor of abandoning the plan due to the bridge's "doubtful usefulness and viability," as well as the inability of the already burdened Italian treasury to bear its share of the cost.  Additionally, transport minister Alessandro Bianchi pointed out that the road and rail links leading to the location of the proposed bridge are not capable of supporting enough traffic to make the bridge profitable.  Other reasons for abandoning the plan were earthquake risk, and fears that much of the funds would be diverted to organized crime.<ref>

== Controversy and concerns ==
Many also questioned the priority of the bridge, since some towns in Sicily are still without running water,<ref>http://www.waterconserve.info/articles/reader.asp?linkid=13659</ref> and claimed that the money used for the bridge would be better spent elsewhere. 

There are also those who claimed that the bridge would be totally unnecessary, since the local economy is already providing for the conversion of a local former Autostrada A20 linking Autostrada A3 on the mainland linking Reggio Calabria to Naples.

Finally, there were concerns about the environmental impact of the bridge, its actual feasibility, and whether it could resist earthquakes, not uncommon in the region.

==The Strait==
The Strait of Messina is a funnel-shaped arm of sea that connects the Ionian Sea in the south to the Tyrrhenian Sea to the north. The width of the strait varies from a maximum of approximately 16 km (between Capo d'Alì in Sicily and Punta Pellaro in Calabria) to a minimum of approximately 3 km between Capo Peloro in Sicily and Torre Cavallo in Calabria. A similar distance separates Pezzo and Ganzirri; at that point, the strait is only 72 m deep, while in other places it can reach 200 m deep. It is also characterized by strong currents.
