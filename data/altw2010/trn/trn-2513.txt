'''Artistik Buz Pateni''' Dört Kıta Şampiyonaları ve İSU Grand Prix Yarışmaları gibi yarışmalarda düzenlenir.
 
Olimpiyatlar düzeyinde yarışmalar düzenlenen Buz Dansı, Çiftler, Tekler disiplinlerinden başka pek çok değişik şekilde icra edilebilir. (Dörtlü ya da 10-12 kişilik gruplar halinde)
== Atlayışlar ==

Buz Pateninde 6 önemli atlayış (jump) vardır. Bunlardan 3'ü ayağa buz vurup güç alarak, diğer 3'ü ise havaya sıçrayarak gerçekleştirilir.

Bunlardan ayağı buza vurup güç alarak yapılanlar;

#  Toe loop   
#  Flip
#  Lutz

Havaya sıçrayarak yapılanlar;

# Salchow
# Loop
# Axel

Bu atlayışlar tek başlarına yapılabildikleri gibi arka arkaya, kombine bir biçimde de yapılabilirler. Kombine atlamalar patenciye daha fazla puan yapar

== Puanlama Sistemi ==

2002 Kış Olimpiyatları'na kadar Buz Pateninde 6'lık sistem denen, sporcuların sergilediği programın 6 tam puan üzerinden değerlendirildiği bir sistem uygulanmıştır. Bu sistemde hakemler sporcunun performansına göre teknik ve artistik olarak 2 farklı puan verirler. Teknik puanlar sporcunun yaptığı atlayışlar, dönüşler, bunların hatasız yapılıp yapılmaması gibi serideki teknik elemanları, artistik puanlar ise sporcunun müzikle uyumu, kostümleri, buz pistinin kullanımı gibi öğeleri içerir. Hakemler sporcuyu 6.0 tam puan üzerinden değerlendirir. 6.0 tam puan serinin kusursuz bir biçimde sergilendiğini gösterir. Hakemler 5.4 ya da 4.2 gibi ondalık puanlar da verebilir.

2002 Kış Olimpiyatlarında Çifler kategorisi yarışmasında patlak veren, sonunda 2 çiftin birden olimpiyat şampiyonu ilan edildiği olaylardan sonra <ref> [http://www.buzpateni.com/2002_olimp_ciftler.htm 2002 Olimpiyatları / Çiftler]</ref> yeni bir puanlama sistemi getirildi.

Bu sistemde sporcuların yaptıkları her bir hareketin (atlayışlar,dönüşler,kaldırışlar) bir ham puanı vardır. Hakemler hareketin yapılışına göre sporcuya bu puandan 3 puan fazla ya da 3 puan düşük verebilir.

'''Figure skating''' is an athletic spins, jumps, footwork and other  intricate and challenging moves on ice. Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level (senior), and at local, national, and international competitions. The International Skating Union (ISU) regulates international figure skating judging and competitions. Figure skating is an official event in the Winter Olympic Games. In languages other than English, figure skating is usually referred to by a name that translates as "artistic skating". 

Major international competitions are sanctioned by the ISU. These include the World Championships, the World Junior Figure Skating Championships, the European Figure Skating Championships, the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships, and the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating.

The sport is also associated with show business. Major competitions generally include exhibitions at the end in which the top-placing skaters perform for the crowd by showing off their various skills. Many skaters, both during and after their competitive careers, also skate in ice skating exhibitions or shows which run during the competitive season and the off-season.

==Disciplines==

Olympic sports in figure skating comprise the following disciplines:<ref name=olympic>[http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/disciplines_uk.asp?DiscCode=FS Figure skating at Olympic.org], accessed September 4, 2006.</ref>

* '''Singles''' competition for men and women (who are referred to as "ladies" in ISU rulebooks), wherein skaters perform jumps, spins, step sequences, spirals, and other elements in their programs.

*'''death spirals, and other elements.

*'''Ice dancing''' is again for couples consisting of a woman and a man skating together.  Ice dance differs from pairs in focusing on intricate footwork performed in close dance holds, in time with the music. Ice dance lifts must not go above the shoulder.

Other disciplines of figure skating include:

*'''Synchronized skating''', for mixed-gender groups of 12 to 20 skaters. This discipline resembles a group form of ice dance with additional emphasis on precise formations of the group as a whole and complex transitions between formations. These formations can range from wheels (shown in picture below) either attached or not, splices, blockes, no holds, and footwork. Footwork is known to be diffucult because every skater has to be in time with each other and the feet have to be picked up enough to be seen from up in the stands but most importantly from the judges table.

*'''Compulsory figures''', in which skaters use their blades to draw circles, figure 8s, and similar shapes in ice, and are judged on the accuracy and clarity of the figures and the cleanness and exact placement of the various turns on the circles.  Figures were formerly included as a component of singles competitions but were eliminated from those events in 1990.  Today figures are rarely taught or performed.  The United States was the last country to retain a separate test and competitive structure for compulsory figures, but the last national-level figures championship was held in 1999.

*'''Moves in the field''' (known in the United Kingdom as ''field moves''), which have replaced compulsory figures as a discipline to teach the same turns and edge skills in the context of fluid free skating movements instead of being constrained to artificially precise circles.

*'''Fours''', a discipline that is to pairs as pairs is to singles.  A team of four skaters, consisting of two men and two women, perform singles and pairs elements in unison, as well as unique elements that involve all four skaters.

*'''Theatre on ice''', also known as "ballet on ice" in Europe.  This is a form of group skating that is less structured than synchronized skating and allows the use of props and theatrical costuming.

*'''Adagio skating''', a form of pair skating most commonly seen in ice shows, where the skaters perform many spectacular acrobatic lifts but few or none of the singles elements which competitive pairs must perform.

*'''Special figures''', the tracing of elaborate original designs on the ice, common in the early days of skating.

*'''Acrobatic skating''', also known as "Acrobatics on ice" or "Extreme Skating", is a combination of circus arts, technical artistic gymnastics skills, and figure skating.

==Jumps==

Jumps involve the skater leaping into the air and rotating rapidly to land after completing one or more rotations. There are many types of jumps, identified   by the way the skater takes off and lands, as well as by the number of rotations that are completed. 

Most skaters rotate all their jumps in the counterclockwise direction.  Some prefer to rotate clockwise, and a very small number of skaters can perform jumps in both directions.  For clarity, all jumps will be described for a skater jumping counter-clockwise. Jumps are one of the most important elements of figure skating.

There are six major jumps in figure skating.  All six are landed on one foot on the right back outside edge (with counterclockwise rotation, for single and multi-revolution jumps), but have different takeoffs, by which they may be distinguished.  The two categories of jumps are toe jumps and edge jumps. 

===Toe jumps===
Toe jumps are launched by tapping the toe pick of one skate into the ice, and include (in order of difficulty from easiest to hardest):

# Toe loops take off from the back outside edge of the right foot and are launched by the left toe pick (toe walleys are similar, but take off from the back inside edge of the right foot);
# Flips, which take off from the back inside edge of the left foot and are launched by the right toe pick;
# Lutzes, which take off from the back outside edge of the left foot and are launched by the right toe pick. 
*When skaters accidentally take off from a back inside edge for the Lutz Jump, the error is called a Lip.

===Edge jumps===
Edge jumps use no toe assist, and include:

# Salchows, which take off from a left back inside edge.  Allowing the edge to come round, the opposite leg helps launch the jump into the air and land on one foot;
# Loops (also known as Rittberger jumps) take off from a right back outside edge and land on the same edge;
# Axels, which are the only rotating jump to take off from a forward edge (the left outside edge).  Because they take off from a forward edge, they include one-half extra rotations and are usually considered the hardest jump of the six.  The similar jump with only half a rotation is called a waltz jump and is typically the first jump a skater learns.

===Rotations and combinations===
The number of rotations performed in the air for each jump determines whether the jump is a single, double, triple, or quad.  Most elite male skaters perform triples and quads as their main jumps, while most elite female skaters perform all the triples except the Axel, which is usually double.  Only six female skaters have ever been credited as successfully landing the triple Axel in competition, and only one has landed a quadruple jump (salchow) in competition.

In addition to jumps performed singly, jumps may also be performed ''in combination'' or ''in sequence''. For a set of jumps to be considered a combination, each jump must take off from the landing edge of the previous jump, with no steps, turns, or change of edge in between jumps.  This limits all jumps except the first to toe loops and loops (which take off from the right back outside edge on which the basic six jumps are landed).  In order to use other jumps on the back end of a combination, connecting jumps such as a half loop (which is actually a full rotation, but lands on a left back inside edge) can be used, enabling the skater to put a salchow or flip at the end of the combination. In contrast, jump sequences are sets of jumps, which may involve steps, or changes of edge between the jumps.

===Other jumps===
There are also a number of other jumps that are usually performed only as single jumps and in elite skating are used as transitional movements or highlights in step sequences.  These include the half loop, half flip, inside Axel, and one-foot Axel.

==Spins==
thumb|right|[[Shizuka Arakawa performs a donut spin (camel-variation)]]

There are many types of spins, identified by the position of the arms, legs, and angle of the back. The three basic spin positions are upright, camel, and sit.  The skater rotates on the round part of the blade, called the ball of the foot, just behind the toe pick. Spins may be performed singly or in a sequence combining different types of spins. 

Spins may be performed on either foot. Figure skaters are rarely able to spin in both directions; most favor one or the other. For skaters who rotate in a counterclockwise direction, a spin on the left foot is called a forward spin, while a spin on the right foot is called a back spin. 

In pair skating and ice dancing, there are additionally ''pair spins'' and ''dance spins'' in which the two skaters rotate together around the same axis. In pair skating, there are also ''side by side'' spins, in which the skaters spin next to each other.

''Flying'' spins are spins that are initiated with a jump. These include the flying camel, flying sit spin, death drop, and butterfly spin. Usually, they go from a forward spin, to a back spin.

Spins are a required element in most figure skating competitions.

==Lifts==

right|thumb|A straight line dance lift
Lifts are a required element in pair skating and ice dancing. Pairs lifts differ from dance lifts most notably in that dancers are not allowed to lift their partners above their shoulders.

Dance lifts are differentiated by the skating involved. There are seven kinds of lifts approved for ISU competitions. They are separated into ''short lifts'' and ''long lifts''. There are many positions the lifting and the lifted partner can take to improve the difficulty of the lift. Each position must be held for at least three seconds to count and is permitted only once a program. 

Unlike dance lifts, pair lifts are grouped by the holds involved. In ISU senior level competition, the man must rotate more than one times, but fewer than three a half. There are five different groups of pairs lifts, differentiated by the holds involved. Legal holds are ''Armpit holds'', ''Waist holds'', ''Hand to hip holds'', and ''Hand to hand''. There are two kinds of hand to hand lifts: press lifts and lasso lifts. The lasso lifts are considered the most difficult pair lifts.

Twist lifts are a form of pair lifts, where the lifted partner is thrown into the air, twists, and is caught by the lifted partner. The lady may do a split before the twist, called a ''split twist''. This is not mandatory, but it increases the level of the element. The lady must be caught by her waist in the air. She lands on the backward outside edge. The man also ends the lift on one foot.

In both pairs and dance, lifts that go on longer than allowed receive deductions.

Synchronized skating teams are also allowed to perform lifts in the free skating portion of the senior division only. Lifts can be pair lifts (such as in a dance lift) or a group lift with two or more skaters lifting another skater. In a pair lift, no more than one arm may be fully extended above the head at any time. Acrobatic lifts are not allowed. To gain additional points, teams will sometimes rotate and/or move lifts across the ice.

==Steps and turns==

Step sequences are a required element in competition programs. They involve a combination of turns, steps, hops and edge changes, performed in a straight line down the ice, in a circle, or in an S shape (serpentine step sequence).

The various turns, which skaters can incorporate into step sequences, include:

*Three turns, so called because the blade turns into the curve of the edge or lobe to leave a tracing resembling the numeral "3".  

*Bracket turns, in which the blade is turned counter to the curve of the lobe, making a tracing resembling a bracket ("}").

*Rockers and counters, one-foot turns that involve a change of lobe as well as of direction.
