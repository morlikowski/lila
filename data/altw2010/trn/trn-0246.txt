'''Wereldmuziek''' (zie ook volksmuziek) is muziek die terug te leiden is tot een bepaalde bevolkingsgroep of land. Niet alle wereldmuziek kent een traditie van muzieknotatie. In dat geval wordt de muziek op het oor van speler tot speler doorgegeven. Daarbij verandert de muziek vaak geleidelijk, en is het niet duidelijk -en ook niet zo belangrijk- wie de componist is. Er bestaan ook tradities binnen de wereldmuziek, die zichzelf met recht als ''klassiek'' beschouwen, zoals de Hindoestaanse muziek en de Gamelan.

Groepen die wereldmuziek spelen begeleiden vaak werelddansers of beoefenaars van internationale volksdans.

The term '''world music''' includes
* Traditional music (sometimes called folk music or roots music) of any culture that are created and played by indigenous musicians or that are "closely informed or guided by indigenous music of the regions of their origin,"<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=LLzbMCxHP00C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=%22closely+informed+or+guided+by+indigenous+music+of+the+regions+of+their+origin%22&source=web&ots=Ne9PB-Slnl&sig=tu3IPPfn-5zwkQH1vkIfNQoBDOs#PPA2,M1 Nidel 2004, p.2]</ref>  including Western music (i.e. Celtic music). Most typically, the term ''world music'' has now replaced ''folk music'' as a shorthand description for the very broad range of recordings of traditional indigenous music and song from around the world.
* Other non-Western music (including non-Western popular music and non-Western classical music)  
* The music of Hawaii and other Pacific islands, although it may be influenced by other cultures and other genres.

World music does not include
* Western popular music
* Western Art music (i.e. European classical music)
* Any post-ska genre of Jamaican music  (i.e. reggae and its various subgenres)
* Reggaeton

==Terminology==
The term has been credited to ethnomusicologist Robert E. Brown who coined it in the 1960s. <ref>http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20051211/news_lz1j11brown.html</ref>
The term became current in the 1980s as a marketing/classificatory device in the media and the music industry, and it is generally used to classify any kind of foreign (i.e. non-Western) music.

In musical terms, world music can be roughly defined as music that uses distinctive scales, modes and musical inflections, and which is usually (though not always) performed on or accompanied by distinctive traditional ethnic instruments, such as the kora (West African harp), the steel drum, the sitar or the didgeridoo.

There are several conflicting definition for world music.  One is that it consists of "all the genres of non-Western music that were previously described as ''folk music'' or ''ethnic music''. However, world music does not have to mean traditional folk music, it may refer to the indigenous classical forms of various regions of the world, and to modern, cutting edge pop music styles as well. Succinctly, it can be described as "local music from out there",<ref>''fRoots'' magazine, quoted in N'Dour 2004, p.1</ref> or "someone else's local music".<ref>''Songlines'' magazine</ref>

Music from around the world exerts wide cross-cultural influence as styles naturally influence one another, and in recent years world music has also been marketed as a successful genre in itself. Academic study of world music, as well as the musical genres and individual artists with which it has been associated, can be found in such disciplines as anthropology, Folkloristics, Performance Studies and ethnomusicology

Examples of popular forms of world music include the various forms of non-European classical music (e.g. Japanese koto music, Indian Central and South America.

The broad category of world music includes isolated forms of cross-over" music. Musicians from diverse cultures and locations could readily access recorded music from around the world, see and hear visiting musicians from other cultures and visit other countries to play their own music, creating a melting pot of stylistic influences. 

While communication technology allows greater access to obscure forms of music, the pressures of commercialization also present the risk of increasing musical homogeny, the blurring of regional identities, and the gradual extinction of traditional local music-making practices.
===Popular non-Western genres===
Although it primarily describes traditional music, the world music genre also includes popular music from non-Western urban communities (e.g. South African "township" music) and non-European music forms that have been influenced by other so-called third-world musics (e.g. Afro-Cuban music), although Western-style popular song sourced from non-English-speaking countries in Western Europe (e.g. French pop music) would not generally be considered world music.

===World Music in France===
Paris is one of the great European capitals for world music. For many years, the city has attracted numerous musicians from former colonies in West Africa and North Africa. This thriving scene is aided by the fact that there are many concerts and institutions that help promote the music.

Algerian and Moroccan music have an important presence in the French capital. Hundreds of thousands of Algerian and Moroccan immigrants have settled in Paris, bringing the sounds of Amazigh (Berber), rai, and Gnawa music. Algerian ra√Ø  also found a large French audience, especially Cheb Mami.<ref> World Music Central, p.12 </ref>

The West African community is also very large, integrated by people from Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, and Guinea. They have introduced manding jeli music, mbalax and other styles.

== Cultural appropriation in western music ==

== After 1987: WOMAD and beyond ==
The origins of the term World Music in relation to the selling of this type of music began in 1982 when World Music Day (Graceland'' album. The concept behind the album was to express his own sensibilities using the sounds which he had fallen in love with listening to artists from Southern Africa, including Johnny Clegg amongst others had to some degree introduced non-western music to a wider audience and this was an opportunity which could not be ignored.

Before 1987, although World Music undoubtedly had a following and with this potential market opening up, it was difficult for interested parties to sell their music to the larger music stores; although specialist music stores had been important in developing the genre over many years, the record companies, broadcasters and journalists had been finding it difficult to build a following because the music itself seemed too scarce. They were eyeing the Jazz and Classic markets, watching them develop a cross-over audience and decided that the best way forward would be to collective strategy to bring the music to a wider audience.

At the outset of the 1987 meeting, the musician Roger Armstrong advised why something needed to be done; "(He) felt that the main problem in selling our kind of material lay with the UK retail outlets and specifically the fact that they did not know how to rack it coherently. This discouraged them from stocking the material in any depth and made it more difficult for the record buyers to become acquainted with our catalogues."

The first concern of the meetings was to select the umbrella name that this 'new' music would be listed under. Suggestions included 'World Beat' and prefixing words such as 'Hot' or 'Tropical' to existing genre titles, but 'World Music' won after a show of hands, but initially it was not meant to be the title for a whole new genre, rather something which all of the record labels could place on the sleeves of records in order to distinguish them during the forthcoming campaign. It only became a title for the genre after an agreement that despite the publicity campaign, this wasn't an exclusive club and that for the good of all, any label which was selling this type of music would be able to take advantage. 

Another issue which needed to be addressed was the distribution methods which existed at the time. Most of the main labels were unhappy with the lack of specialist knowledge displayed by sales persons which led to poor service; there was also a reluctance amongst many of the larger outlets to carry the music, because they understandably liked larger releases which could be promoted within store. It was difficult to justify a large presentation expense if the stock going into stores was limited.

One of the marketing strategies used in the vinyl market at the time was the use of browser cards, which would appear in the record racks. As part of the World Music campaign it was decided that these would be a two colour affair designed to carry a special offer package; to aid the retailer a selection of labels would also be included<ref>presumably for shelf or rack edging.</ref> 

In an unprecedented move, all of the World Music labels co-ordinated together and developed a compilation cassette for the cover of the music magazine NME. The overall running time was ninety minutes, each package containing a mini-catalogue showing the other releases on offer. This was a smart move as NME reader are often seen as discerning listeners and it was important step to get them on board.

By the time of that second meeting it was becoming clear that in order for the campaign to be successful, it should have its own dedicated press officer. They would be able to juggle the various deadlines and also be able to sell the music as a concept to not just the national stations but also regional DJs who were keen to expand the variety of music they could offer. They were seen as a key resource as it was important for 'World Music' to be seen as something which could be important to people outside London - most regions after all had a similarly rich folk heritage which could be tapped into. A cost effective way of achieving all this would be a leafleting campaign.

The next step was to develop a World Music chart, gathering together selling information from around fifty shops, so that it would finally be possible to see which were big sellers in the genre - allowing new listeners to see what was particularly popular. It was agreed that the NME could again be involved in printing the chart and also Music Week and the London listings magazine City Limits. It was also suggested that Andy Kershaw might be persuaded to do a run down of this chart on his show regularly.

And so October of 1987 was designated 'World Music' month. A music festival, 'Crossing the Border' was held at the Town & Country Club, London and it was the start of the winter season for both WOMAD and Arts Worldwide. The main press release stressed the issues inherent in the campaign:
