'''End time''', '''End times''', or '''End of days''' are the eschatological writings in the three eschatological beliefs associated with turning and redemption.

==Abrahamic religions==
===Judaism===

In Judaism, ''End times'' are usually called ''The End of Days'' (''aharit ha-yamim'', אחרית הימים), a phrase that appears several times in the Tanakh. Though the idea of a messianic age has a prominent place in Jewish thought, it is not a pre-ordained event but rather brought about by religious observance and good deeds. 

The term may refer to a number of interwoven themes:
**Jewish messianism
**The ingathering of the exiles
**Rebuilding of the Temple
**Animal sacrifice or Korban<ref></ref> <ref></ref> <ref></ref>

*The World to Come (''Olam ha-Ba'') is an ambiguous term that may refer to the resurrected

====Tribulation recorded in the Old Testament====
Tumultuous events will overturn the old world order, as is recorded in these example verses contained in the following Old Testament verses of the Bible:

<blockquote>
Deuteronomy 4:29-39 (King James Version):  But if from thence thou shalt seek the  thy GOD, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul. When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the  thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice; (For the  thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them. For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the  your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?  Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the  he is God; there is none else beside him. Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire. And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt; to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day. Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the  he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Isaiah 2:1-5 (King James Version): The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the 's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the , to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the  from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Micah 4:1-5 (King James Version): But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the  shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the , and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the  from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the  of hosts hath spoken it. For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the  our God for ever and ever.
</blockquote>

These events create a new order in which God is universally recognized as the ruler over His creation, which includes everyone and everything.

===The Talmud===
In other writings, one of the sages of the Talmud says:

<blockquote>
"Let the end of days come, but may I not live to see them", because they will be filled with so much conflict and suffering."
</blockquote>

The Conservative and Reform Jews and some Christians) think that the years of the Torah, or Jewish Bible, are symbolic. According to the ancient Jewish teachings continued by today's Orthodox Jews, the years are literal and consistent throughout all time, with 24 hours per day and an average of 365 days per year. Appropriate calibrations are, of course, done with leap years, to account for the difference between the lunar calendar and the solar calendar, since the Jewish calendar is based on both. Thus the year 2007 equals 5767 years ''since creation of man'' on the present Jewish calendar.  According to this calculation, the end of days will occur at or before the year 2240 (the year 6000 in the Hebrew calendar).

According to Jewish tradition, those living during the end times will see:
#Ingathering of the scattered Jewish exiles to geographic Israel,
#Defeat of all of Israel's enemies,
#Building (or divine placement) of the third Jewish sacrificial offerings and Temple service,
#Revival of the Dead (''techiat hameitim''), or the Resurrection,
#At some point, the King of Israel. He will divide the Jews in Israel into their original tribal portions in the land. During this time, Gog, king of Magog Ezekiel 39, will attack Israel. 
Magog will fight a great battle, in which many will die on both sides, but God will intervene and save the Jews. This is the battle referred to as Armageddon. God, having vanquished this final enemy once and for all, will accordingly banish all evil from human existence. After the year 6000 (in the Jewish calendar), the seventh millennium will be an era of holiness, tranquility, spiritual life, and worldwide peace, called the ''Olam Haba'' ("Future World"), where all people will know God directly."

"All Israel have a portion in the world to come." (Talmud Sanhedrin 10:1) The Ramban (Nachmanades) interprets the world to come as the ultimate good and purpose of creation. He therefore holds that the world to come actually refers to the resurrection of the dead. An event that will occur after the messianic age has already begun. The Ramban holds that all Israel, even the sinners, have a portion in this epoch of resurrection. (The Tzemach Tzedek, Derech Mitzvosecha, Law of Tzitzis).

===Christianity===

Some 2 Thessalonians chapter 2). This belief had largely dissipated by around AD 90, when Christians said, "We have heard these things [of the end of the world] even in the days of our fathers, and look, we have grown old and none of them has happened to us".<ref></ref>

The Apocalypse of John and Gospel of John are held by most current Christian scholars to have been written at least a decade after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD, and especially around 90-95AD for those supportive of the Dispensationalism school of thought. This claim has been contested (See Preterism), and there has been much debate following the publication of Kenneth Gentry's work ''Before Jerusalem Fell'', which book argues from archaeology and ancient texts (including the Book of Revelation itself) that the book of Revelation was written during the reign of Roman emperor Nero in the 60's AD. 

Conservatives usually place the writing of the synoptic gospels before the fall of Jerusalem. Liberal Christians place the writing of the three other (Paul Barnett, disputes this and places the writing of John's gospel at an early date.

==== Tribulation in the New Testament ====

The prophetic theme of the New Testament also mirrors the Old Testament, namely, Tribulation. In the New Testament, Jesus refers to this as the "Great Tribulation", "Affliction", and "days of vengeance."

<blockquote>
Matthew 24:15-22 (King James Version):  "When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand). Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains. Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house. Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day. For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Mark 13:14-20 (King James Version):  "But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains: And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house: And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment. But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter. For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be. And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Luke 21:20-33 (King James Version):  "And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees; When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away."
</blockquote>

===Catholicism===
right|thumb|[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgement - Fresco in the Sistine Chapel by Michelangelo.]]

Catholicism mainly adheres to the Amillenial school of thought, promoted by Augustine of Hippo in his work "The City of God". Augustine claims a non-literal fulfillment of prophecy. Catholics may also refer to Matthew's Gospel, Chapter 24, Verse 36, in which Christ is quoted as saying:

<blockquote>
"No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father." (NIV Version)
</blockquote>

While some who believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible insist that the prediction of dates or times is futile, some other writers believe that Jesus foretold of signs which would indicate that the "end of days" was near. Some of these signs include earthquakes, natural disasters, civil problems, 'wars and rumors of wars', and other catastrophes. Of the precise time, however, it will come like a "thief in the night."

According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the Catholic beliefs concerning the "end times" are addressed in the Profession of Faith.<ref>An explanation of these beliefs can be found on the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c2a7.htm#668 Holy See's website]</ref>

===Protestantism===
thumb|left|200px|The Antichrist, by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder (1521) Here the Antichrist is shown wearing the triple crown of the Roman papacy.]]
Millennialists concentrate on the issue of whether the true believers will see the evangelical sects. Amillennialists believe that the end times encompass the time from Christ's ascension to the Last day, and maintain that the mention of the "thousand years" in the Book of Revelation is meant to be taken metaphorically (i.e., not literally, or 'spiritually').

End-times beliefs in Protestant Christianity vary widely. Christians premillennialists who believe that the End Times are occurring now, are usually specific about timelines that climax in the end of the world. For some, dispensational premillennialists writers, there are those who believe that Christians will be supernaturally summoned to Heaven by Jesus in an event called the Rapture, which occurs before the biblical "Great Tribulation" prophesied in Matthew 24-25; Mark 13 and Luke 21. The Great Tribulation is also mentioned in the last book of the Bible - the book of Revelation.

'End times' may also refer simply to the passing of a particular age or long period in the relationship between man and God. Adherents to this view sometimes cite St. Paul's second letter to Timothy, and draw analogies to the late 20th/early 21st centuries.

Post-Exilic Hebrew books of Second Book Of Esdras.

Most fundamentalist Christians anticipate that biblical prophecy will be fulfilled literally. They see current world and regional wars, earthquakes, hurricanes and famines as the beginning of the birth pains which Jesus described in Matthew  and Mark . They believe that mankind started in the Megiddo as the place that the current world system will finish, with the Advent of Messiah coming to rule for 1,000 years.

Contemporary use of the term ''End Times'' has evolved from use around a group of literal beliefs in Christian dispensational premillennialists. In 1918 a group of eight well known preachers produced a London Manifesto warning of an imminent second coming of Christ shortly after the 1917 liberation of Jerusalem by the British. 

Religious movements which expect that the second coming of Christ, will be a cataclysmic event, generally called ''adventism'', have arisen throughout the Christian era; but they became particularly common during and after the Protestant Reformation. Shakers, Emanuel Swedenborg (who considered the second coming to be symbolic, and to have occurred in 1757), and others developed entire religious systems around a central concern for the second coming of Christ, disclosed by new prophecy or special gifts of revelation.  The Millerites are diverse religious groups which similarly rely upon a special gift of interpretation for fixing the date of Christ's return.  

The chief difference between the nineteenth century Millerite and Adventist movements and contemporary prophecy belief is that William Miller and his followers fixed the time for the Second Coming by moral catastrophes, and accordingly believe that God's judgment against the conflict-ridden and corrupt world is close at hand.

====Preterism====
Another view of the 'end times' known as end of the covenant between God and Israel, rather than the end of time, or the end of planet Earth.  Unlike all the other Christian theological systems, Preterism holds an exclusive and unique view on the nature and timing of the 'End Times', in that Preterists teach the 'end times' to be in the first century AD.

Preterists believe that prophecies such as the Final Judgment were fulfilled at or about the year AD 70 when the Roman general (and future Emperor) Titus sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Jewish Temple, putting a permanent stop to the daily animal sacrifices.

Proponents of Full Preterism do not believe in the bodily Resurrection of the dead and place this event as well as the Second Coming in AD 70, whereas proponents of Partial Preterism do believe in a bodily resurrection of the dead at a future Second Coming. Full preterists contend that those who consider themselves to be partial preterists are actually just futurists since they believe the Second Coming, Resurrection, Rapture and Judgment are still in the future.

Many preterists believe the first-century living Christians were literally raptured off the earth to be with Christ. At that time, their bodies were changed to be like Christ's. Preterists also believe the term 'Last Days' or 'End Times' refers not to the last days of planet Earth, or last days of mankind, but to the last days of the Old Covenant, the Mosaic Covenant which God had exclusively with Israel until year AD 70.

According to Matt. 10:23, Matt. 16:28, Matt. 24:34, Matt. 26:64, Rom. 13:11-12, 1 Cor. 7:29-31, 1 Cor. 10:11, Phil. 4:5, James 5:8-9, 1 Pet. 4:7, 1 Jn. 2:18.

====Dispensationalist prophecies====

The reestablishment of Israel in 1948 provided a major impetus to the dispensationalist belief system. Israel's history of wars after 1948 with its Arab neighbors provided further research as was seen in at least one book by John F. Walvoord<ref></ref>. After the Six Day War in 1967, and the Yom Kippur War in 1973, it seemed plausible to many Fundamentalist Christians in the 1970s that Middle East turmoil may well be leading up to the fulfillment of various Bible prophecies and to the Battle of Armageddon.

Leaders of the dispensationalist movement such as Beast. A revived Roman Empire also figured into the single nation and emerges as a superpower. Under this thinking, the Antichrist will probably either be the President of the European Union or the president of its successor, probably a united Europe.

On Associate Member of the European Union. This agreement was negotiated in 1995. This associate membership allows Israel to cooperate with Europe in industry, trade, transportation, communication, and energy usage. Israel is now officially linked to the so-called Revived Roman Empire. It is claimed that this associate membership of Israel with Europe establishes the relationship that Israel will have with the Antichrist.

The Beast (Antichrist) is believed to be the dictatorial leader of a "one world government."  He would promise peace to the world while leading the world's population into 666.

To quote Revelation 13, verses 16-18 (NIV):

<blockquote>
"He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number. His number is 666."
</blockquote>

Thus, with this understanding, it was and is believed that everyone, in order to enter into this economic system, had to have the Number of the Beast some kind of mark branded on them. This created speculation as to the nature of the mark. One theory has a computer chip such as an integrated circuit being inserted or injected via hypodermic needle under the skin, perhaps a transponder, see also Microchip implant (human). As with the Roman emperors of ancient times, he would impose martyrdoms on those refusing to take this mark. At some point after his appearance, a large number of Jews would convert to Christianity and preach the gospel after the Christians had been removed by the Rapture.

Some believers in this theory began reading the newspaper headlines, concerned that some world leader might have the prophesied characteristics to be the Antichrist, and wondering whether the continuing Mid-East violence might be a sign of impending Armageddon. They were also concerned with such things as UPC damnation.

The Antichrist, (it is believed), will take center-attention on the 'world-stage' initially as a global peacemaker which Daniel mentions in Daniel 9:27. This coming prince will enter into a covenant or treaty with Israel for a period of seven years. Perhaps using global disarmament, he will promise to ensure peace in the world after a particularly destructive future war (this future war being a belief of post-tribulationists; not of Dispensationalists). His ally in world leadership will be the Whore of Babylon who is seen in vision by John, recorded in Revelation 17. John saw this mysterious harlot actually riding the beast and exerting some sort of control over it for a period of time. This mother-harlot entity heads up an apostate church or global system of false religion, which includes other, less influential churches.

At the midpoint of the final seven years, a world ravaged by plague and turmoil turns to the Antichrist to lead it. Their hope is that a world dictator will promise "peace and safety" and he will usher in a new age. The Antichrist, however, is possessed directly by Satan and will eventually display his true intentions. Again, in Daniel 9:27, the prophet states that at this time this "prince" will stop the daily sacrifices, (which had been resumed again on the Beast, the Antichrist assumes global dictatorial rule and establishes his economic system based upon the mark of '666'. His persecutions of newly-converted Christians, as well as Jewish people at that time will be unprecedented. This three and a half year period of intense tribulation was referred to by the prophets Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Joel, Daniel and other biblical prophets throughout the Old and New Testament writings. It was also spoken of by Jesus Christ in the Olivet Discourse and The Sheep and the Goats. In Revelation 13, the Apostle John sets the duration of this 'time of trouble' to 42 biblical months, or three and one-half years. This period is referred to by Biblical eschatologists as the "Great Tribulation". The period also  coincides with the time of "Jacob's trouble" mentioned in the book of Jeremiah, and the trampling down of Jerusalem is referred to by John in Revelation Chapter 11.

Eventually, the Antichrist, under the threat of approaching 'kings of the east', commands his armies to attack this Asian threat. This campaign takes place in the valley of Megiddo, which according to the book of Revelation is the place known for the approaching Battle of Armageddon. The valley of Megiddo is situated as a great plain located northwest of Israel. At the climax of the story, Jesus returns in the Second Coming. He destroys the armies gathering for the campaign against Jerusalem. To quote the NIV version of Revelation 19:19-21:

<blockquote>
"Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army. But the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who had performed the miraculous signs on his behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped his image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur. The rest of them were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh."
</blockquote>

The separate destinies of the Church and Israel, a belief which is inherent in dispensationalism is a particular concern to some Jews and to some evangelical Christians. Evangelicals who reject dispensationalism, such as those who hold to a Post Tribulation Rapture, (or more accurately a Post Tribulation Resurrection-Rapture), see both the Church and Israel entering the crucible of the End Time together. These Traditional Pre-Millennialists, as they are called, reject dispensationalism and its end time eschatology as setting forth a dubious eschatology of an "apartheid of the Elect". They consider the dispensationalist doctrine of a Pre-Tribulation Rapture to be self-serving and highly unlikely to be the true last days policy of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Traditional Pre-Millennialists see all the covenant people of the God of Israel being refined together in the crucible of the end time. They also see the "royal priesthood and holy nation" referred to by Moses and by the Apostle Peter being unveiled in the Apocalypse as a single remnant Elect drawn out from Israel and from the wider Church in the nations.

United States of America. 

Since the majority of the Biblical prophets were writing at a time when [Israel] was mostly Futurists their destruction in AD 70 put the prophetic timetable, if there is one, on hold. Many such believers therefore anticipated the return of Jews to Israel and the reconstruction of the Temple before the Second Coming could occur. (See Christian Zionism)

====Specific prophetic movements====
*In William Miller made the first of several predictions that the world would end in only a few months. As his predictions did not come true (referred to as the followers of Miller went on to found separate churches, the most successful of which is the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

====Latter-day Saints and Mormonism ====
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormons, has taught that humanity is living in the last days.

Some Latter-day Saints believe that the earth does have a temporal existence of 7000 years, and that the present day is somewhere near the 6000th year. They do not speculate as to the time, day or year of the second coming, but watch for indications that the event is approaching.

Latter-day Saints believe that their church is led by sabbath and day of rest. The seven seals and seven trumpets of the Book of Revelation relate to the seven millennia allotted to Earth by Latter-day Saint theology.

Latter-day Saints are frequently counseled to watch for the "signs of the times" but not to fear them. The statement "if ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (from Doctrine and Covenants 38:30) has become somewhat of a mantra among the Latter-day Saints. Wars, pestilence, economic despair, natural disasters and more are all part of what Latter-day Saints see as signs of the times. In particular, a great earthquake is mentioned in all cases.

Other events that Latter-day Saints regard as important, and the dates some of them have purportedly occurred:
*Priesthood authority, which had been lost in the great apostasy, to be restored (this happened in May 1829).
*The pure gospel of Jesus Christ is to be restored, and taught in His church (this has happened, on April 6, 1830).
*Elijah would return and give priesthood keys (this has happened, on April 3, 1836).
*The return of the Jews to Jerusalem and Israel, as dedicated by Orson Hyde on October 24, 1841 (first wave of Jewish immigration to Israel, or Aliyah (עלייה) started in 1881).
*The building of a temple in Israel (this has not occurred).
*The building of a temple in Zion, Jackson County, Missouri (this has not occurred, although the location is marked).
*Temples will "dot the earth" (according to Mormon sources, 136 temples as of December 2006).
*A meeting of priesthood leaders with angelic beings and Christ in Adam-ondi-Ahman (this has not occurred).
*Christ will appear in the Temple in Jackson County, Missouri (this has not occurred).
*Wars will be poured out upon all nations.
*The nations of the earth will be gathered to fight Israel.
*The Wicked will be consumed by fire (some traditions allude to a nuclear holocaust, and some hold that this will be at the coming of Christ.)
*The restored gospel will be preached in all nations, kindreds, tongues, and peoples (there are, according to Mormon sources, 53,000 missionaries in 165 countries as of 2005).

Many Latter-Day Saints' temples feature a statue of Moroni on the highest spire. Most of these statues face East, the direction from which Christ will come. The Salt Lake City temple has two large doors on the east side of the building, that are not used. Tradition holds that Christ will enter the temple through these doors, when He comes again.

After the coming of Christ to the mount of Olives, and the destruction of the wicked, the righteous will live on the earth in relative peace and prosperity during the millennium, under the leadership of Christ. Other churches still may exist during this time, and not all people living will be Latter-day Saints, but such people will represent the "more righteous" part of the peoples of the earth. Missionary work and temple work for the deceased (see Baptism for the dead) will continue during the millennium and missionary and genealogy work will be a main focus of Church members and other righteous individuals who live during the time leading up to the final judgement.

Joseph Smith produced an inspired rendition of  24, relating to the end times.

Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe that, at the beginning of the Millennial Era, Jesus Christ the Lord will appear at his Second Coming and usher in a thousand-year era of peace, called the Millennium, whereby Satan will be bound (Doctrine and Covenants 88:110), the wicked will be removed from the Earth, and the righteous will be "caught up to meet him". A resurrection of the righteous who have died will occur--they will also "be caught up to meet him." (Doctrine and Covenants 88:96-97). During the Millennium, every man or woman to ever live on the Earth will be resurrected. Those individuals who were righteous will be resurrected at the beginning, and will be able to visit the Earth to restore the knowledge about family histories; the wicked will be resurrected at the end of the Millennium (D & C 76:85).

At the time of each person's resurrection, their Last Judgment will occur, during which all individuals will be placed into one of three heavenly kingdoms: the Celestial Kingdom, the Terrestrial Kingdom, and the Telestial Kingdom. In the Doctrine and Covenants, Joseph Smith Jr., who is believed to be the translator of the Book of Mormon and the first Mormon prophet, leader, and seer for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, reveals that the kingdoms will be separated into various levels of glory in symbolic comparison to the sun, the moon, and the stars. The sun, being the brightest of these heavenly bodies, is relative to the glory of the celestial kingdom, which is reserved for those who obey the commandments, live righteously, and become baptized. The moon, being the second brightest heavenly body, is relative to the terrestrial kingdom, which is for those who are righteous in a sense, but do not constantly obey the commandments and/or are not baptized. The stars, being the least brightest heavenly body, are relative to the telestial kingdom, which is for those individuals who are wicked and commit major sins without repenting, including murderers. A very small group of people who reject Jesus Christ after receiving full and indisputable knowledge of his divinity, will go to what is referred to as the Outer darkness, which is where Satan will eventually be consigned forever with his hosts of angels.(D & C 76:43-46)

While the exact time of Christ's return is not known in Latter-Day Saints' theology, there are certain signs that are accepted as pointing to his return:

* The mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, Isa. 2: 2-3. 
* The Lord shall lift an ensign and gather Israel, Isa. 5: 26 (2 Ne. 15: 26-30). 
* The sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not cause her light to shine, Isa. 13: 10 (Joel 3: 15; D & C 29: 14). 
* Men shall transgress the law and break the everlasting covenant, Isa. 24: 5. 
* The Nephites (ancient fallen people of the Americas, descended from Joseph of Egypt) shall speak as a voice from the dust, Isa. 29: 4 (2 Ne. 27). 
* Israel shall be gathered with power, Isa. 49: 22-23 (1 Ne. 21: 22-23; 3 Ne. 20-21). 
* God shall set up a kingdom which shall not be destroyed, Dan. 2: 44 (D & C 65: 2). 
* War, dreams, and visions shall precede the Second Coming, Joel 2. 
* All nations will gather against Jerusalem to battle, Zech. 14: 2 (Ezek. 38-39). 
* The day cometh that shall burn as an oven, Mal. 4: 1 (3 Ne. 25: 1; D & C 133: 64; JS-H 1: 37). 
* Great calamities shall precede the Second Coming, Matt. 24 (JS-M 1).

====Rastafarians====
The Rastafari movement believes the end times began with the crowning of Haile Selassie as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930, and that he will soon reveal himself as God.  

They moreover believe that Ethiopian historical events such as the Second Italo-Ethiopian War are prophesied in the Bible. The rastafarians are waiting for Selassie to call the day of judgment, punish the wicked, and take the righteous back to Africa to live in  Mount Zion in Africa to live with him forever in perfect peace, love and harmony. The present society in which they find themselves is referred to as Babylon, and will be destroyed on the day of judgment. 

Rastafarians have a unique interpretation of the end times, based on the die.

==== Jehovah's Witnesses ====
Jehovah's Witnesses have their own unique eschatology, involving the Second Coming of Jesus Christ and the start of the Last Days.  Witnesses believe that the Holy Bible is the word of God and his means of communicating with us.  They believe that Bible prophecy has always been precisely fulfilled in the past.  Therefore they also believe that future prophecy will also come exactly true. Witnesses believe that the term "last days" refers to the concluding time period leading up a divinely appointed execution that marks the end of a system of things.  Scriptures had a minor fulfillment involving the time period before the end of the Jewish system of things in 70 C.E. and are now having a major fulfillment in this time period before God cleanses the earth of Satan's wicked system of things.  The concept of "major" and "minor" fulfillment is not found in the Bible.

Witnesses believe that the last days began in 1914 when Jehovah God installed Jesus as the King of God's Kingdom.  His first action is described in the book of Revelation, in which Jesus cleanses heaven and casts Satan to the earth.  Conditions on earth would then deteriorate to an all time low, culminating in war, pestilence and earthquakes.  Witnesses believe that history proved this date true with the start of World War I in 1914 and the worst global epidemic to date in the Spanish Influenza in 1918. <ref>[http://www.watchtower.org/e/dg/article_09.htm How We Know We Are in "the Last Days" - Jehovah's Witnesses Official Web Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

In the future, Witnesses believe that God will cleanse the earth of all wickedness and Satan will be bound for 1,000 years.  During this time period, people will be resurrected to life on earth and given a chance to learn about God (Jehovah) and live under the rule of Jesus Christ. Christ would rule over the Earth with the 144,000 co rulers and restore earth to its former paradise-like state.  They feel biblical prophecy shows there will be no more death or sickness and people will live in peace and harmony, just as God originally purposed for Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.

Jehovah's Witnesses have very specific doctrines on the End Times, explained in detail in the literature of the Watchtower Society.  Witnesses teach that the Greek word ''parousia'', often translated as 'coming' really means 'presence', that the presence (invisible coming) of Christ began in the year 1914, and that he now sits at God's right hand, ruling amidst his enemies. (Ps. 110:1,2; Heb.10:12,13) This is not to be confused with his reign however. Jehovah's Witnesses calculate the year 1914 from Bible prophecy.

# Daniel 4:17 says that the dream that God gave to King Nebuchadnezzar deals with the Kingdom of God and God's promise to give it to " the one whom he wants " or  " the lowliest one of mankind." The Bible says that Jesus Christ was indeed "the lowliest one of mankind." (Phil. 2:7, 8; Matt. 11:28-30) He is also the one to whom Jehovah 'wants to' give the kingdom. (Luke 1:31-33; Rev. 11:15) Thus, Jehovah's Witnesses believe this dream was also fulfilled in Jesus Christ.
# Rulership over mankind, as represented by the tree and its rootstock, would have "the heart of a beast." (Dan. 4:16) As Jesus showed in his prophecy pointing to the conclusion of the system of things (end of the world), Jerusalem would be "trampled on by the nations, until the appointed times of the nations (gentile times)" were fulfilled. (Matt.24:3; Luke 21:24) According to Jehovah's Witnesses, "Jerusalem" represented the Kingdom of God because its kings were said to sit on "the throne of the kingship of Jehovah." (1 Chron. 28:4, 5; Matt. 5:34-35) The Gentile governments are represented  in the book of Daniel by wild beasts (bears, rams, goats, etc). Daniel 2:37 depicts these kingdoms, beginning with Nebuchadnezzar, being given rulership of the world, succeeded by other kingdoms to follow. Then, in Daniel 2:44, God would reassert the authority of his kingdom by 'crushing' these kingdoms. This was a prophetic picture of how the gentile kingdoms would 'trample' on the right of God's Kingdom to direct human affairs and would themselves hold sway under Satan's control, until the 'gentile times' ended (Luke 21:21). (Dan. 7:2-8, 17, 23; 8:20-22; Rev. 13:1, 2; Luke 4:5, 6)
# Revelation 11:2, 3 and 12:6, 14 clearly states that 42 months (3 1/2 years) in that prophecy are counted as 1,260 days. "Seven times" or Seven years would be twice that, or 2,520 days.  Bible shows that  a day is counted as a year in calculating prophetic time in two of its many prophecies (Ezek. 4:6; Num. 14:34), then prophetic "seven times" means 2,520 years. 
# According to Jehovah's Witnesses, the counting of the "seven times" begin after Zedekiah, the last king in the typical Kingdom of God, was removed from the throne in Jerusalem by the Babylonians. (Ezek. 21:25-27) Jehovah's Witnesses believe that this took place 70 years before 537 B.C., the year in which they believe the Jews returned from captivity; that is, it took place by early October of 607 B.C. (Jer. 29:10; Dan. 9:2) Counting 2,520 years from early October of 607 B.C. brings us to early October of 1914.

'''Endzeit''' ist im Rahmen der zweiten Gegenwart oder Wiederkunft Christi vorhergeht. Im Anschluss an die Wiederkunft Christi kommt nach christlicher, biblischer Verheißung das Weltgericht ( Seuchen, dem 10-Staatenbund mit dem Antichristen sowie Ungerechtigkeit, politischer und sozialer Unordnung bis hin zum End-Krieg, der in der Bibel als Schlacht von Harmagedon beschrieben wird. 

== Endzeit im Christentum ==

Nach Aussagen der Bibel geht die "Endzeit" dem Kommen Jesu Christi als Endrichter voraus.

Die Endzeit wird in dem letzten Buch der Bibel, der Offenbarung des Johannes, ausführlich beschrieben.

Im Katechismus der katholischen Kirche -nicht der Bibel- wird dies wie folgt beschrieben:

"675: Vor dem Kommen Christi muß die Kirche eine letzte Prüfung durchmachen, die den Glauben vieler erschüttern wird. Die Verfolgung, die ihre Pilgerschaft auf der Erde begleitet, wird das 'Mysterium der Bosheit' enthüllen: Ein religiöser Lügenwahn bringt den Menschen um den Preis des Abfalls von der Wahrheit eine Scheinlösung ihrer Probleme. Der schlimmste religiöse Betrug ist der des Antichrist, das heißt eines falschen Messianismus, worin der Mensch sich selbst verherrlicht, statt Gott und seinen im Fleisch gekommenen Messias.

677: (...) Das Reich wird also nicht in stetigem Fortschritt durch einen geschichtlichen Triumph der Kirche zustande kommen, sondern durch den Sieg Gottes im Endkampf mit dem Bösen. In diesem Sieg wird die Braut Christi vom Himmel herabkommen. Nach der letzten kosmischen Erschütterung dieser Welt, die vergeht, wird es in Gestalt des letzten Gerichts zum Triumph Gottes über den Aufstand des Bösen kommen."

=== Bibelstellen ===
: Christus kommt als ''König der Könige'' und vernichtet die Heiden mit einem Schwert, das von seinem Mund ausgeht (dem Wort Gottes). 

: zur Rechten Gottes sitzend richtet Jesus unter Ewigen Lebens; die Erlösten kommen ins Paradies und genießen die jüngstes Gericht bzw. nach katholischer Anschauung ewige Höllenqualen, im "''feurigen Pfuhl, der mit Schwefel brennt''" (vgl. Fegefeuer).

Zeitlich damit zusammenhängend, jedoch in der Chronologie nicht unumstritten, findet die Entrückung der Gläubigen statt.
