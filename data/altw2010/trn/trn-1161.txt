==Career==
===Early career===
Rob Van Dam debuted in 1990 after being trained by The Sheik, wrestling his first match against Dango Nguyen in title, the SAPW Tag Team Championship, in July 1992 with Chaz Rocco.<ref name="biouswa">[http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#uswa RVD's Career At USWA/SAPW (1992)]</ref>

He signed with World Championship Wrestling in late 1992 and was dubbed Robbie V upon his arrival. His WCW run was uneventful and largely unnoticed.<ref name="biowcw">[http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#wcw RVD's Career At WCW (1992)]</ref> He also wrestled in several independent promotions across America, and in All Japan Pro Wrestling, where he challenged for the AJPW World Junior Heavyweight Championship on several occasions.<ref name="rvdindies">[http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#indy RVD's Independent Career (1993-1995)]</ref>

===Extreme Championship Wrestling===
====1996–1997====
In January 1996, Van Dam signed with promoter stoner, and he became a face due to his laid-back attitude and unorthodox style. On March 30, he faced 2 Cold Scorpio in a match for the ECW Television Championship, which ended in a draw so 2 Cold Scorpio retained the title.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996a.html#033096 ECW results - March 30, 1996]</ref><ref name="bioecw">[http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#ecw Rob Van Dam's ECW Career (1996)]</ref>

Van Dam gained attention following a series of matches with long-time rival Sabu, began with a match at ''Hostile City Showdown'', won by Sabu.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996b.html#042096 Hostile City Showdown 1996 results]</ref> After the match, Van Dam declined to show proper respect for his opponent, leading to a rematch at ''A Matter of Respect'', which was won by Van Dam.<ref name="bioecw"/> Per the pre-match stipulation, Sabu then offered Van Dam a handshake, but was again ignored. Instead, Van Dam left the ring and turned heel under the management of Hardcore Heaven, Van Dam faced his rival Sabu once again, in a match to prove who was the better man. Sabu won the match.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996b.html#062296 Hardcore Heaven 1996 results]</ref><ref name="bioecw"/> The two faced each other yet again in a stretcher match at ''The Doctor is In''. Van Dam lost the match after missing a Plancha to the outside, hitting the railing and falling onto the stretcher.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996c.html#080396 The Doctor is In results]</ref> He was quickly rolled out.<ref name="bioecw"/>

At ''Natural Born Killaz'', Van Dam defeated Dan Kroffat, Van Dam wanted a tag team partner of his own. After losing to long-time rival Sabu once again at ''Unluckily Lottery'', the two united and formed what was to become one of the most successful tag teams in ECW history.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996c.html#091396 Unluckily Lottery results]</ref> They feuded with Furnas and Kroffat defeating them at ''When Worlds Collide II'' and ''High Incident''.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996c.html#091496 When Worlds Collide II results]</ref><ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996d.html#102696 High Incident results]</ref><ref name="bioecw"/>

At ''Crossing the Line Again'' and Cyberslam, the teams faced off for the ECW Tag Team Championship in a pair of matches, both of which were won by The Eliminators.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997a.html#020197 Crossing the Line Again results]</ref><ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997a.html#022197 Cyberslam 1997 (February 21, 1997) results]</ref><ref name="ECW97">[http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#97 RVD's ECW Career (1997)]</ref> At CyberSlam, the two teams faced each other for the titles in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, in which The Eliminators again retained their titles.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997a.html#022297 Cyberslam 1997 (February 22, 1997) results]</ref>

At ECW's first pay-per-view event Barely Legal, Van Dam defeated Lance Storm as a last-minute replacement for the injured Chris Candido.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997b.html#041397 Barely Legal results]</ref> Immediately following the match, RVD expressed his distaste for being chosen as a back-up for "some guy who couldn't even lace his boots". RVD delivered a speech directed towards Paul Heyman, and not being originally booked on the show was a point of contention between Van Dam and Heyman for a time.<ref name="ECW97"/>

In May 1997 ECW "invaded" the World Wrestling Federation's ''Monday Night Raw'' television show, drawing the ire of color commentator Van Dam and Sabu with him. Van Dam cut promos about how he was too good for ECW and deserved to be in one of the "Big Two" (WWF or WCW) on one of their Monday Night programs ("Monday Night Raw" or "Monday Nitro"), while Jerry Lawler dubbed Van Dam "Mr. Monday Night" on an episode of ''Raw''. Despite his arrogance and "betrayal" of ECW, over time Van Dam became applauded by fans recognizing his athleticism and unique maneuvers.<ref name="rvdwwf">[http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#wwf RVD: Mr. Monday Night]</ref>

Van Dam continued to team up with Sabu upon his return to ECW on June 13.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997b.html#061397 ECW results - June 13, 1997]</ref> Tazz's manager Bill Alfonso betrayed Tazz and joined Sabu and Van Dam.

====1998–2001====
In 1998, Van Dam started a feud with fatal four way elimination tag team match later that night.<ref name="hostilecity98"/> At CyberSlam, Van Dam and Sabu fell to Shane Douglas and Bam Bam Bigelow.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1998a.html#022198 Cyberslam 1998 results]</ref>

Van Dam's popularity increased when he got his first taste of ECW gold, on April 4 when he defeated Bam Bam Bigelow to win the Wrestlepalooza. The match was a time limit draw, resulting in Van Dam retaining his title.<ref name="ecw98"/><ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1998b.html#050398 Wrestlepalooza 1998 results]</ref>

At ''A Matter of Respect'', Van Dam and Sabu were forced to face each other in a tag team match as they both teamed up with ECW Tag Team Champions.

Van Dam remained the Television champion for the rest of 1998, and he started 1999 by making successful title defenses against the likes of Spike Dudley,<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999a.html#010299 ECW results - January 2, 1999]</ref> Lance Storm at Guilty as Charged,<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999a.html#011099 Guilty as Charged 1999 results]</ref> Balls Mahoney,<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999a.html#011599 ECW results - January 15, 1999]</ref> and 2 Cold Scorpio at CyberSlam.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999b.html#040399 CyberSlam 1999 results]</ref><ref name="ecw99">[http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#99 RVD's ECW Career (1999)]</ref>

Van Dam and Sabu were scheduled to make a title defense of the Tag Team titles on April 17, but Sabu was suspended by ECW before the match occurred.<ref name="ecw99"/> Instead, Van Dam faced D-Von Dudley in a singles match and as a result of losing the match, Van Dam also lost the Tag Team titles to the Dudleyz.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999b.html#041799 ECW results - April 17, 1999]</ref> After losing the Tag Team titles, Van Dam focused on defending the Television title.<ref name="ecw99"/> He entered into a rivalry with Hardcore Heaven in a "no time limit" match. Van Dam retained the title, and the match was deemed so good that TNN in place of a shoot promo about TNN that he was planning, but was not allowed to air, according to The Rise and Fall of ECW.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999b.html#051699 Hardcore Heaven 1999 results]</ref> Van Dam continued to defend the ECW Television Championship for the remainder of the year.

Van Dam began a feud with Rhino in the beginning of 2000. RVD made a successful title defense of the ECW Television Championship against Rhino on January 7.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/2000a.html#010700 ECW results - January 7, 2000]</ref> RVD got a big victory during a title defense against Sabu at Guilty as Charged.<ref name="ecw2000">[http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#00 RVD's ECW Career (2000)]</ref><ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/2000a.html#010900 Guilty as Charged 2000 results]</ref> Van Dam was scheduled to perform in a "champion vs. champion" pay-per-view main event against ECW Champion Mike Awesome. This match potentially could have been the most lucrative pay-per-view main event in company history, and Heyman was depending on this mega-match to bring an influx of badly-needed cash but the match never occurred because Van Dam suffered a broken ankle during a successful title defense against Rhino on January 29.<ref name="ecw2000"/><ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/2000a.html#012900 ECW results - January 29, 2000]</ref> The injury also forced Van Dam to vacate the ECW Television Championship.

Van Dam then attempted to exact revenge on Rhino for forcing him into injury. He got many opportunities to win the ECW Television Championship back from Rhino, but Rhino's allies usually attacked Van Dam, causing disqualifications and allowing Rhino to retain the title.<ref name="ecw2000"/> At Anarchy Rulz, Van Dam faced Rhino for the ECW Television Championship but was screwed when a heel referee made a fast count during a pinfall attempt made by Rhino.<ref name="ecw2000"/><ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/2000d.html#100100 Anarchy Rulz 2000 results]</ref>

Van Dam was not advertised and did not show for a large number of ECW events due to the large sum of money owed to him.<ref name="ecw2000"/> He appeared at ECW's final pay-per-view event Guilty as Charged, where he defeated Jerry Lynn.<ref name="ecw2001">[http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#01 RVD's ECW Career (2001)]</ref><ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/2001.html#010701 Guilty as Charged 2001 results]</ref> This was Van Dam's last appearance in ECW, as ECW only held two more shows after the pay-per-view.
