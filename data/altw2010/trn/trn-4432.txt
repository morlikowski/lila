'''Ziqmund Freyd''' (Sigmund Freud) (1856-1939), psixologiya alimi.

Sonralar tez-tez psixoanaliz adlandırılan psixologiyadakı psixodinamik yanaşma  Freyd  tərəfindən işlənmişdir. «Psixodinamik»terminin özü şəxsiyyətin ayrı-ayrı aspektləri: instinkt, təfəkkür və şüur arasında arasıkəsilməyən mübarizəni nəzərdə tutur. 

Psixoanalitik müəlliflər kişi və qadın arasındakı psixoloji fərqlərə diqqət yetirir, lakin qadın qender rollarının inkişafı barədəçox vaxt kişi inkişafı ilə bağlı təsəvvürlərə əsaslanaraq ümumi nəzəri nəticə çıxarmağa cəhd göstərirdilər. Patriarxallıq motivləri başlıca əlamət kimi bütün psixoanalizdən keçirvə qadın kiçilmiş kişi olaraq qəbul edilir.

'''Sigmund Freud''' (), born '''Shlomo Sigismund Freud''' (psychoanalytic school of repression and for creating the clinical practice of psychoanalysis for curing psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud is also renowned for his redefinition of sexual desire as the primary motivational energy of human life, as well as his therapeutic techniques, including the use of free association, his theory of transference in the therapeutic relationship, and the interpretation of dreams as sources of insight into unconscious desires.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Sigmund Freud was born on Galician Jewish<ref name="Gresser" ></ref> parents in economic crisis of 1857, father Freud lost his business, and the family moved first to Leipzig before settling in Vienna. In 1865, Sigmund entered the ''Leopoldstädter Kommunal-Realgymnasium'', a prominent high school. Freud was an outstanding pupil and graduated the Matura in 1873 with honors.

After planning to study law, Freud joined the medical faculty at Karl Claus. At that time, eel life history was still unknown, and due to their mysterious origins and migrations, a racist association was often made between eels and Jews and Gypsies. In search for their male sex organs, Freud spent four weeks at the Austrian zoological research station in Trieste, dissecting hundreds of eels without finding more than his predecessors such as Simon von Syrski. In 1876, he published his first paper about "the testicles of eels" in the "Mitteilungen der österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften", conceding that he could not solve the matter either.   Frustrated by the lack of success that would have gained him fame, Freud chose to change his course of study. Biographers like Siegfried Bernfeld wonder if and how this early episode was significant for his later work regarding hidden sexuality and frustrations.<ref>[http://www.expertensprechen.de/ Expertensprechen zum Thema Aale<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2004/1020/feuilleton/0027/index.html Was dachten Nazis über den Aal? : Textarchiv : Berliner Zeitung<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.wno.org/newpages/sci02b.html Der Aal im Nationalsozialismus<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Medical school===
In 1874, the concept of "Brücke, Breuer, Helmholtz, and Herbart.<ref name="Bowlby" ></ref>  In 1879, Freud interrupted his studies to complete his one year of obligatory military service, and in 1881 he received his ''Dr. med.'' (M.D.) with the thesis ''Über das Rückenmark niederer Fischarten'' ("on the spinal cord of lower fish species").

===Freud and psychoanalysis===

In October 1885 Freud went to Paris on a travelling fellowship to study with Europe's most renowned neurologist, Jean Martin Charcot. He was later to remember the experience of this stay as catalytic in turning him toward the practice of medical psychopathology and away from a less financially promising career in research neurology<ref>[http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=pct.009.0223a Joseph Aguayo ''Charcot and Freud: Some Implications of Late 19th Century French Psychiatry and Politics for the Origins of Psychoanalysis'' (1986). Psychoanalysis and Contemporary Thought, 9:223-260]</ref>. Charcot specialised in the study of hysteria and its susceptibility to hypnosis which he frequently demonstrated with patients on stage in front of an audience. Freud later turned away from hypnosis as a potential cure, favouring free association and dream analysis.<ref>[http://www.healthcentral.com/anxiety/c/1950/20288/freud-101/ AnxietyConnection.com

After opening his own medical practice, specializing in neurology, Freud married Martha Bernays in 1886. Her father Berman was the son of Isaac Bernays chief rabbi in Hamburg. After experimenting with hypnosis on his neurotic patients, Freud abandoned this form of treatment as it proved ineffective for many, in favor of a treatment where the patient talked through his or her problems. This came to be known as the "'''talking cure'''", as the ultimate goal of this talking was to locate and release powerful emotional energy that had initially been rejected, and imprisoned in the unconscious mind. Freud called this denial of emotions "repression", and he believed that it was often damaging to the normal functioning of the psyche, and could also retard physical functioning as well, which he described as "psychosomatic" symptoms. (The term "talking cure" was initially coined by the patient Anna O. who was treated by Freud's colleague Josef Breuer.)  The "talking cure" is widely seen as the basis of psychoanalysis.<ref></ref>

There has long been dispute about the possibility that a romantic liaison blossomed between Freud and his sister-in-law, Minna Bernays, who had moved into Freud's apartment at 19 Berggasse in 1896. It has been suggested <ref>Hans Jurgen Eysenck. Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire. Transaction Publishers. 2004, p146</ref> that the affair resulted in a pregnancy and subsequently an abortion for Miss Bernays. A hotel log dated August 13, 1898 has been suggested to support the allegation of an affair.<ref></ref>

In his 40s, Freud "had numerous psychosomatic disorders as well as exaggerated fears of dying and other phobias" (Corey 2001, p. 67). During this time Freud was involved in the task of exploring his own dreams, memories, and the dynamics of his personality development. During this self-analysis, he came to realize the hostility he felt towards his father (Jacob Freud), who had died in 1896,<ref name="PBSBio"></ref> and "he also recalled his childhood sexual feelings for his mother (Amalia Freud), who was attractive, warm, and protective" (Corey 2001, p. 67). Corey (2001) considers this time of emotional difficulty to be the most creative time in Freud's life.

After the publication of Freud's books in 1900 and 1902, interest in his theories began to grow, and a circle of supporters developed in the following period. Freud often chose to disregard the criticisms of those who were skeptical of his theories, however, which earned him the animosity of a number of individuals, the most famous being Carl Jung, who originally supported Freud's ideas. Part of the reason for their fallout was due to Jung's growing commitment to religion and mysticism, which conflicted with Freud's atheism.<ref></ref>

===Last years===
In 1930, Freud received the Goethe Prize in appreciation of his contribution to psychology and to German literary culture. Three years later the Nazis took control of Germany and Freud's books featured prominently among those burned and destroyed by the Nazis. In March 1938, Nazi Germany annexed Austria in the Anschluss. This led to violent outbursts of anti-Semitism in Vienna, and Freud and his family received visits from the Gestapo. Freud decided to go into exile "to die in freedom". He and his family left Vienna in June 1938 and moved to Hampstead, London. 

A heavy cigar smoker, Freud endured more than 30 operations during his life due to oral cancer. In September 1939 he prevailed on his doctor and friend Max Schur to assist him in suicide. After reading Balzac's ''La Peau de chagrin'' in a single sitting he said,  "My dear Schur, you certainly remember our first talk. You promised me then not to forsake me when my time comes. Now it is nothing but torture and makes no sense any more." Schur administered three doses of morphine over many hours that resulted in Freud's death on September 23, 1939.<ref></ref> 
Three days after his death, Freud's body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in England during a service attended by Austrian refugees, including the author Stefan Zweig. His ashes were later placed in the crematorium's columbarium. They rest in an ancient Greek urn which Freud had received as a present from Marie Bonaparte and which he had kept in his study in Vienna for many years. After Martha Freud's death in 1951, her ashes were also placed in that urn. Golders Green Crematorium has since also become the final resting place for Anna Freud and her lifelong friend Dorothy Burlingham, as well as for several other members of the Freud family.

==Freud's ideas==
Freud has been influential in two related but distinct ways.  He simultaneously developed a theory of how the human psychopathology. He theorized that personality is developed by the person's childhood experiences.
===Early work===
thumb|upright|right|Sigmund Freud memorial in [[Hampstead, North London. Sigmund and William Little, the man who first identified cerebral palsy, was wrong about lack of oxygen during the birth process being a cause.  Instead, he suggested that complications in birth were only a symptom of the problem.  It was not until the 1980s that Freud's speculations were confirmed by more modern research.

Freud hoped that his research would provide a solid scientific basis for his therapeutic technique.  The goal of Freudian therapy, or ego.

Classically, the bringing of unconscious thoughts and feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging the patient to talk in free association and to talk about dreams.  Another important element of psychoanalysis is a relative lack of direct involvement on the part of the analyst, which is meant to encourage the patient to project thoughts and feelings onto the analyst.  Through this process, transference, the patient can reenact and resolve repressed conflicts, especially childhood conflicts with (or about) parents.

The origin of Freud's early work with psychoanalysis can be linked to Joseph Breuer.  Freud actually credits Breuer with the discovery of the psychoanalytical method.  One case started this phenomenon that would shape the field of psychology for decades to come, the case of Anna O.  In 1880 a young girl came to Breuer with symptoms of what was then called female hysteria.  Anna O. was a highly intelligent 21-year-old woman.  She presented with symptoms such as paralysis of the limbs, dissociation, and amnesia; today this set of symptoms are known as conversion disorder.  After many doctors had given up and accused Anna O. of faking her symptoms, Breuer decided to treat her sympathetically, which he did with all of his patients. He started to hear her mumble words during what he called states of absence.  Eventually Breuer started to recognize some of the words and wrote them down.  He then hypnotized her and repeated the words to her; Breuer found out that the words were associated with her father's illness and death.  

In the early 1890s Freud used a form of treatment based on the one that Breuer had described to him, modified by what he called his "pressure technique". The traditional story, based on Freud's later accounts of this period, is that as a result of his use of this procedure most of his patients in the mid-1890s reported early childhood sexual abuse. He believed these stories, but after being heavily criticized for this belief and hearing a patient tell the story about Freud's personal friend being a victimizer, Freud concluded that his patients were fantasizing the abuse scenes. 

In 1896 Freud posited that the symptoms of 'hysteria' and obsessional neurosis derived from ''unconscious'' memories of sexual abuse in infancy, and claimed that he had uncovered such incidents for every single one of his current patients (one third of whom were men). However a close reading of his papers and letters from this period indicates that these patients did not report early childhood sexual abuse as he later claimed: rather, he based his claims on analytically inferring the supposed incidents, using a procedure that was heavily dependent on the symbolic interpretation of somatic symptoms.

===Freud and cocaine=== 
Freud was an early user and proponent of cocaine as a stimulant as well as analgesic. He wrote several articles on the antidepressant qualities of the drug and he was influenced by his friend and confidant Wilhelm Fliess, who recommended cocaine for the treatment of the "nasal reflex neurosis." Fliess operated on Freud and a number of Freud's patients whom he believed to be suffering from the disorder, including Emma Eckstein, whose surgery proved disastrous.. 

Freud felt that cocaine would work as a panacea for many disorders and wrote a well-received paper, "On Coca," explaining its virtues. He prescribed it to his friend anesthetic properties (of which Freud was aware but on which he had not written extensively), after eye surgery. Freud was bruised by this, especially because this would turn out to be one of the few safe uses of cocaine, as reports of addiction and overdose began to filter in from many places in the world. Freud's medical reputation became somewhat tarnished because of this early ambition. Furthermore, Freud's friend Fleischl-Marxow developed an acute case of "cocaine psychosis" as a result of Freud's prescriptions and died a few years later. Freud felt great regret over these events, which later biographers have dubbed "The Cocaine Incident."  However, he managed to move on, and even continued to use cocaine.

Dr. Jurgen von Scheidt speculated that most of Freud's psychoanalytical theory was a byproduct of his cocaine use.<ref></ref>

===The Unconscious===

Perhaps the most significant contribution Freud made to Western thought were his arguments concerning the importance of the unconscious mind in understanding conscious thought and behavior.  The western world overwhelmingly supported positivism up until Freud's time- the belief that self-knowledge as well as self-control is possible. Freud, however, came up with a revolutionary as well as controversial idea by declaring that people essentially have no free will.

As psychologist Jacques Van Rillaer, among others, pointed out, "contrary to what most people believe, the unconscious was not discovered by Freud. In 1890, when psychoanalysis was still unheard of, von Hartmann, Janet, Binet and others had used the term 'unconscious' and 'subconscious'".<ref>Meyer (2005, 217).</ref>  Boris Sidis, a Russian Jew who emigrated to the United States of America in 1887, and studied under William James, wrote ''The Psychology of Suggestion: A Research into the Subconscious Nature of Man and Society'' in 1898,  followed by ten or more works over the next twenty five years on similar topics to the works of Freud.  Historian of psychology Mark Altschule concluded, "It is difficult - or perhaps impossible - to find a nineteenth-century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious cerebration as not only real but of the highest importance."<ref>, cited in [http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/articleprint.php?num=57 Allen Esterson, Freud returns?]</ref> Freud's advance was not, then, to uncover the unconscious but to devise a method for systematically studying it, and his claims about the dynamics and structure of the unconscious.

Freud called dreams the "royal road to the unconscious". By this, he meant that dreams illustrate the "logic" of the unconscious mind. Freud developed his first topology of the psyche in ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' (1899) in which he proposed the argument that the unconscious exists and described a method for gaining access to it. The preconscious was described as a layer between conscious and unconscious thought&mdash;that which we could access with a little effort. 
Thus, Freud argued against any attempts to repress the unconscious and instead believed that 
it needed to be understood in order to achieve the ideals of the Enlightenment, positivism and rationalism. 

One key factor in the operation of the unconscious is "repression." 
Freud believed that many people "repress" painful memories deep into their unconscious mind. 
Although Freud later attempted to find patterns of repression among his patients in order to derive a general model of the mind, he also observed that repression varies among individual patients. 
Freud also argued that the act of repression did not take place within a person's consciousness. Thus, people are unaware of the fact that they have buried memories or traumatic experiences. 

Later, Freud distinguished between three concepts of the unconscious: the descriptive unconscious, the dynamic unconscious, and the system unconscious. The descriptive unconscious referred to all those features of mental life of which people are not subjectively aware.  The dynamic unconscious, a more specific construct, referred to mental processes and contents which are defensively removed from consciousness as a result of conflicting attitudes. The system unconscious denoted the idea that when mental processes are repressed, they become organized by principles different from those of the conscious mind, such as condensation and displacement.  

Eventually, Freud abandoned the idea of the system unconscious, replacing it with the concept of the Ego, super-ego, and id (discussed below). Throughout his career, however, he retained the descriptive and dynamic conceptions of the unconscious.

===Psychosexual development===

Freud hoped to prove that his model was universally valid and thus turned to ancient Oedipus Rex'' by anthropological studies of totemism and argued that totemism reflected a ritualized enactment of a tribal Oedipal conflict.

Freud originally posited childhood sexual abuse as a general explanation for the origin of neuroses, but he abandoned this so-called "seduction theory" as insufficiently explanatory, noting that he had found many cases in which apparent memories of childhood sexual abuse were based more on imagination than on real events.  During the late 1890s Freud, who never abandoned his belief in the sexual etiology of neuroses, began to emphasize fantasies built around the Oedipus complex as the primary cause of hysteria and other neurotic symptoms.  Despite this change in his explanatory model, Freud always recognized that some neurotics had been sexually abused by their fathers, and was quite explicit about discussing several patients whom he knew to have been abused.<ref></ref>

Freud also believed that the sublimation. He argued that humans are born "polymorphously perverse", meaning that any number of objects could be a source of pleasure.  He further argued that, as humans develop, they become fixated on different and specific objects through their stages of development&mdash;first in the latency stage of psychosexual development preceded the sexually mature genital stage of psychosexual development. 

Freud's way of interpretation has been called phallocentric by many contemporary thinkers. This is because, for Freud, the unconscious desires the phallus (penis). Males are afraid of losing their masculinity, symbolized by the phallus, to another male. Females always desire to have a phallus - an unfulfillable desire.  Thus boys resent their fathers (fear of castration) and girls desire theirs.

===Ego, super-ego, and id=== 
   
In his later work, Freud proposed that the psyche could be divided into three parts: ego, super-ego, and id.  The id is known as the child-like portion of the psyche that is very impulsive and only takes into account what it wants and disregards all consequences.  The super-ego is the moral code of the psyche that solely follows right and wrong and takes into account no special circumstances in which the morally right thing may not be right for that situation.  Finally, the ego is the balance between the two.  It is the part of the psyche that is, usually, portrayed in the person's action, and after the super-ego and id are balanced, the ego acts in a way that takes both impulses and morality into consideration.

Freud discussed this structural model of the mind in the 1920 essay ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'', and fully elaborated it in ''The Ego and the Id'' (1923), where he developed it as an alternative to his previous topographic schema (conscious, unconscious, preconscious).   

Freud acknowledged that his use of the term Id (or the It) derives from the writings of Georg Grodeck. The term Id appears in the earliest writing of Boris Sidis, attributed to William James, as early as 1898.

===The life and death drives===<!-- This section is linked from Erich Fromm -->
Freud believed that humans were driven by two conflicting central desires: the life drive (libido) (survival, propagation, hunger, thirst, and sex) and the death drive (Thanatos). Freud's description of Cathexis, whose energy is known as libido, included all creative, life-producing drives. The death drive (or death instinct), whose energy is known as anticathexis, represented an urge inherent in all living things to return to a state of calm: in other words, an inorganic or dead state. He recognized Thanatos only in his later years and develops his theory on the death drive in ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''. Freud approaches the paradox between the life drives and the death drives by defining pleasure and unpleasure.  According to Freud, unpleasure refers to stimulus that the body receives. (For example, excessive friction on the skin's surface produces a burning sensation; or, the bombardment of visual stimuli amidst rush hour traffic produces anxiety.) Conversely, pleasure is a result of a decrease in stimuli (for example, a calm environment the body enters after having been subjected to a hectic environment). If pleasure increases as stimuli decreases, then the ultimate experience of pleasure for Freud would be zero stimulus, or death.  Given this proposition, Freud acknowledges the tendency for the unconscious to repeat unpleasurable experiences in order to desensitize, or deaden, the body. This compulsion to repeat unpleasurable experiences explains why traumatic nightmares occur in dreams, as nightmares seem to contradict Freud's earlier conception of dreams purely as a site of pleasure, fantasy, and desire. On the one hand, the life drives promote survival by avoiding extreme unpleasure and any threat to life. On the other hand, the death drive functions simultaneously toward extreme pleasure, which leads to death. Freud addresses the conceptual dualities of pleasure and unpleasure, as well as sex/life and death, in his discussions on masochism and sadomasochism.  The tension between Eros and Thanatos represents a revolution in his manner of thinking. Some also refer to the death instinct as the Nirvana Principle.

These ideas resemble aspects of the philosophies of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. Schopenhauer's pessimistic philosophy, expounded in ''The World as Will and Representation'', describes a renunciation of the will to live that corresponds on many levels with Freud's Death Drive. Similarly, the life drive clearly parallels much of Nietzsche's concept of the Dionysian in ''The Birth of Tragedy''. However, Freud denied having been acquainted with their writings before he formulated the groundwork of his own ideas.<ref>Zilborg,</ref>

==Freud's legacy==
<!-- Deleted image removed: thumb|left|230px|Freud on 1980s [[Schilling|50 Austrian Schilling note ]] -->

=== Psychotherapy ===

Freud's theories and research methods have always been controversial. However, Freud has had a tremendous impact on psychotherapy. Many psychotherapists follow Freud's approach to a greater or lesser extent, even if they reject Freud's theories.

Freud's contributions to psychotherapy have been extensively criticised by scholars and historians.

H. J. Eysenck claimed that Freud 'set psychiatry back one hundred years', consistently mis-diagnosed his patients, fraudulently misrepresented case histories and that "what is true in Freud is not new and what is new in Freud is not true".<ref>Eysenck, Hans, Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire (Harmondsworth: Pelican, 1986)</ref>

Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen wrote that "The truth is that Freud knew from the very start that Fleischl, Anna O. and his 18 patients were not cured, and yet he did not hesitate to build grand theories on these non-existent foundations...he disguised fragments of his self-analysis as ‘objective’ cases, that he concealed his sources, that he conveniently antedated some of his analyses, that he sometimes attributed to his patients ‘free associations’ that he himself made up, that he inflated his therapeutic successes, that he slandered his opponents."[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n08/borc01_.html]

=== Philosophy ===
While he saw himself as a scientist, Freud greatly admired enlightenment model of rational agency, which was a key element of much modern philosophy.

==Patients==
Freud used pseudonyms in his case histories.  Many of the people identified only by pseudonyms were traced to their true identities by Peter Swales.  This is a partial list of patients whose case studies were published by Freud:
