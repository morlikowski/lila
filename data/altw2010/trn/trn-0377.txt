:''For the astronaut, see Michael J. Bloomfield''.
'''Michael Bernard Bloomfield''' (San Francisco American musician, guitarist, and composer, born in Chicago, Illinois, became one of the first popular music superstars of the 1960s to earn his reputation entirely on his instrumental prowess. Respected for his fluid guitar playing, Bloomfield, who knew and played with many of Chicago's blues legends even before he achieved his own fame, was one of the primary influences on the mid-to-late 1960s revival of classic Chicago and other styles of blues music. In 2003 he was also also ranked at number 22 on Rolling Stone's "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".<ref></ref>

==Early years==
Bloomfield was born into a wealthy Jewish family on Chicago's North Side but preferred music to the family catering equipment business, becoming a blues devotee as a teenager and spending time at Chicago's South Side blues clubs.

"He had a certain innate talent for playing the guitar that was instantly obvious to his mentors," wrote Al Kooper, Bloomfield's later collaborator and close friend, in a 2001 article. "They knew this was not just another white boy; this was someone who truly understood what the blues were all about."<ref name = "gadfly"></ref> Among his early supporters were B. B. King, Muddy Waters, Bob Dylan and Buddy Guy. Michael used to say, 'It's a natural. Black people suffer externally in this country. Jewish people suffer internally. The suffering's the mutual fulcrum for the blues'."<ref name = "gadfly"/>

==The Butterfield Band==
During those haunts, he met Paul Butterfield Blues Band, which included Bishop and Howlin' Wolf rhythm section alumni Sam Lay and Jerome Arnold. 

Their exuberant, electric Chicago blues inspired a generation of white bluesmen, with Bloomfield's work on the the band's self-titled debut, and the subsequent record ''classical Indian raga. Bloomfield's innovative solos were at the forefront of the ground-breaking piece. He had been inspired to create "East-West" after an all-night LSD trip according to one legend, but a subsequent anthology of the Butterfield band included a booklet saying Bloomfield had also been influenced by John Coltrane and other blues-friendly free-style jazz musicians in creating the piece.

Bloomfield was also a session musician, gaining wide recognition for his work with Bob Dylan during his first explorations into electric music. Bloomfield's sound was a major part of Dylan's change of style, especially on ''Highway 61 Revisited''; his guitar style melded the blues influence with rock and folk. Al Kooper has since revealed - in the booklet accompanying the posthumous ''Don't Say That I Ain't Your Man: Essential Blues, 1964-1969'' - that Dylan had invited Bloomfield to play with him permanently but that Bloomfield rejected the invitation in order to continue playing the blues with the Butterfield band. But Bloomfield and fellow Butterfield members Jerome Arnold and Sam Lay appeared at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, backing Dylan for his controversial first live electric performance.

Rock critic Dave Marsh, in ''Rock and Roll Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles of All Time,'' has also revealed Bloomfield to have been the lead guitarist for Mitch Ryder's hit "Devil With The Blue Dress." However, Marsh's claim is disputed by  Bloomfield collaborator Barry Goldberg, who played keyboards on that track. For the online bio, "The Bloomfield Notes" (#6), Barry states that Mike played on the following recording after "Devil", and "Sock it to Me", another track mistakenly credited to Bloomfield.

==The Electric Flag==
Bloomfield tired of the Butterfield Band's rigorous touring schedule and, relocating to San Francisco, sought to create his own group. Bloomfield left to form the short-lived Electric Flag in 1967 with two longtime Chicago cohorts, organist Barry Goldberg and vocalist Nick Gravenites. The band was intended to feature "American music," a hybrid of blues, soul music, country, rock, and folk, and incorporated an expanded lineup complete with a horn section. The inclusion of drummer Buddy Miles gave Bloomfield license to explore soul and R&B. The Electric Flag debuted at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and issued an album, ''A Long Time Comin''', in April 1968 on Columbia Records. Critics complimented the group's distinctive, intriguing sound but found the record itself somewhat uneven. Unfortunately, the band was already disintegrating; rivalries between members, shortsighted management, and heroin abuse all took their toll. Shortly after the release of that album, Bloomfield left his own band.

== Work with Al Kooper ==
Bloomfield also made an impact through his work with Grape Jam'', an improvisational addendum to Moby Grape's ''Wow'' earlier in the year. 

"Why not do an entire jam album together?" Kooper remembered in 2001. "At the time, most jazz albums were made using this modus operandi: pick a leader or two co-leaders, hire appropriate sidemen, pick some tunes, make some up and record an entire album on the fly in one or two days. Why not try and legitimize rock by adhering to these standards? In addition, as a fan, I was dissatisfied with Bloomfield's recorded studio output up until then. It seemed that his studio work was inhibited and reigned in, compared to his incendiary live performances. Could I put him in a studio setting where he could feel free to just burn like he did in live performances?"

The result was a jam album that spotlighted Bloomfield's guitar skills on one side; Bloomfield's chronic insomnia caused him to repair to his San Francisco home, prompting Kooper to invite Stephen Stills to complete the album. It received excellent reviews and became the best-selling album of Bloomfield's career; its success led to a live sequel, ''The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper'', recorded over three nights at Fillmore West in September 1968.

=== Solo work ===
Bloomfield continued with solo, session and back-up work from 1969 to 1980, releasing his first solo work ''Taj Mahal; and, re-uniting with former bandmates Paul Butterfield and Sam Lay for the Chess Records all-star set, ''Fathers and Sons'', featuring Muddy Waters and Otis Spann, also the same year.   Bloomfield also composed and recorded the soundtrack for the film , Medium Cool by his cousin, Haskell Wexler set during the Democratic Convention in Chicago in 1968.

For a time, however, Bloomfield gave up playing because of his heroin addiction:

'''Michael Bernard Bloomfield''' (américain.

Né dans une riche famille juive de Chicago, Michael Bloomfield découvrit le blues, le rythm'n'blues et le rockabilly sur les ondes des radios du Sud. Il reçut sa première guitare lors de sa bar mitzvah, et commença à écouter du blues électrique dans les quartiers sud de Chicago. Il ne tarda pas à monter sur scène et à jouer avec d'autres musiciens.

En John H. Hammond, qui le fit signer pour CBS. Cependant, plusieurs enregistrements de 1964 ne furent pas publiés, le label ne sachant pas comment promouvoir un guitariste de blues blanc.

En Paul Butterfield, pour former un groupe de rock basé sur le son du blues électrique urbain de Paul Butterfield, Michael Bloomfield quitta le groupe pour former Electric Flag, en 1967, avec le chanteur Nick Gravenites. Electric Flag était censé se baser sur les innovations de East-West, et aller au-delà, notamment en y ajoutant un aspect soul (avec une section de cuivres). Le groupe sortit l'album ''A Long Time Comin'' en 1968. Cependant, des désaccords entre les membres, un management à court terme et l'abus de cocaïne provoqua la fin précoce de Electric Flag.

Michael Bloomfield travailla également avec Al Kooper, sur l'album Super Session, en 1968. Cet album, basé sur les talents de Michael Bloomfield et de Stephen Stills, reçut d'excellentes critiques et devint l'album de M. Bloomfield le plus vendu. Le succès de Super Session déboucha sur The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield & Al Kooper, un album live enregistré au Fillmore West, à San Francisco, en 1968.

Au cours des années 1970, Michael Bloomfield enregistra sur plusieurs petits labels (dont Takoma). Il joua avec d'autres groupes aux alentours de San Francisco, mais sa carrière était clairement derrière lui.

Le 15 février 1981, Michael Bloomfield fut retrouvé mort dans sa propre voiture à San Francisco, très certainement à cause d'une overdose d'héroïne.
