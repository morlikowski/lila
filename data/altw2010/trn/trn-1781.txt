'''''The Corporation''''' is a 2003 Canadian documentary film critical of the modern-day corporation, considering it as a class of person and evaluating its behaviour towards society and the world at large as a psychologist might evaluate an ordinary person. This is explored through specific examples. 

==Creators==
The film was written by TV and is also available on DVD. Bakan wrote the book, ''The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power'' (ISBN 0-74324-744-2), during the filming of the documentary.

==Synopsis==
The film charts the development of the corporation as a legal entity from its origins as an institution chartered by governments to carry out specific public functions, to the rise of the vast modern institutions entitled to some of the legal rights of a person. One central theme of the documentary is an attempt to assess the "personality" of the corporate "person" by using diagnostic criteria from the DSM-IV; Robert Hare, a psychopath. The film focuses mostly on corporations in North America, especially in the United States.

The film is composed of several vignettes examining and critiquing corporate practices, and drawing parallels between examples of corporate malfeasance and the DSM-IV's symptoms of psychopathy, i.e. callous unconcern for the feelings of others, incapacity to maintain enduring relationships, reckless disregard for the safety of others, deceitfulness (repeated lying to and deceiving of others for profit), incapacity to experience guilt, and failure to conform to the social norms with respect to lawful behaviors.

== Topics addressed  ==
Topics addressed include the Franklin Roosevelt, the externalities, suppression of an investigative news story about corporation as a person.

== Interviews  ==
The film also features interviews with prominent corporate critics such as Ray Anderson (from the Interface carpet & fabric company), the capitalist viewpoints of Peter Drucker and Milton Friedman, and  think tanks advocating free markets such as the Fraser Institute. Interviews also feature Dr. Samuel Epstein with his involvement in a lawsuit against Monsanto for promoting the use of Posilac, (Monsanto's trade name for recombinant Bovine Somatotropin) to induce more milk production in dairy cattle.

<blockquote>"The corporation is an externalizing machine (moving its operating costs to external organizations and people), in the same way that a shark is a killing machine." - Robert Monks, a corporate governance advisor in the film and former GOP [Republican] candidate for Senate from Maine</blockquote>

== Reception ==
Film critics gave the film generally favorable reviews. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 90% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 104 reviews.<ref></ref> Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 28 reviews.<ref></ref>

''Variety'' praised the film's "surprisingly cogent, entertaining, even rabble-rousing indictment of perhaps the most influential institutional model for our era" and its avoidance of "a sense of excessively partisan rhetoric" by deploying a wide range of interviewees and "a bold organizational scheme that lets focus jump around in interconnective, humorous, hit-and-run fashion."<ref>[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117922025.html?categoryid=31&cs=1  The Corporation], review by Dennis Harvey in ''Variety'', October 1, 2003</ref>

In the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', Roger Ebert described the film as "an impassioned polemic, filled with information sure to break up any dinner-table conversation."  He felt that "at 145 minutes, it overstays its welcome. The wise documentarian should treat film stock as a non-renewable commodity."<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040716/REVIEWS/407160302/1023The Corporation], review by Roger Ebert in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', July 16, 2004</ref>

The Manufacturing Consent'', which celebrates the life of anarcho-syndicalist, linguist, and activist Noam Chomsky. In their view, "corporate power for profit [is] not the same as megabureaucracy without profit."<ref></ref>
