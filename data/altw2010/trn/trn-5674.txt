'''Lawrence Sullivan "Sul" Ross''' (Governor of Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas.

His family settled in the Waco. As a teenager, Ross attended Florence Wesleyan University.  On one of his summer breaks he suffered severe injuries while fighting renegade Texas Ranger, and in 1860 led troops in the Battle of Pease River, where he rescued Cynthia Ann Parker, who had been captured by the Comanches as a child.  

When Confederacy, Ross joined the generals.  Following the Civil War, Ross briefly served as sheriff of McLennan County before resigning to participate in the 1875 Texas Constitutional Convention.  With the exception of a two-year term as a state senator, Ross spent the next decade focused on his farm and ranch concerns.  In 1887, he became the 19th governor of Texas.  During his two&nbsp;terms, he oversaw the dedication of the new Texas State Capitol, resolved the Jaybird-Woodpecker War, and became the only Texas governor to call a special session to deal with a treasury surplus.

Despite his popularity, he refused to run for a third&nbsp;term as governor. Days after leaving office, Ross became president of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now school traditions.  After his death, the Texas legislature created Sul Ross State University in his honor.

==Early years==
Lawrence Sullivan Ross was born on Missouri legislator Isaac Fulkerson. Ross was jointly named for his paternal uncle, Giles O. Sullivan, and his father's grandfather and brother, both named Lawrence Ross.  The senior Lawrence Ross had been captured by Indians as a child, and lived with them from the time he was 6&nbsp;years old until he was rescued at 23.   To differentiate Ross from his uncle and great-grandfather, he was known as "Little Sul" when he was a child, and later as "Sul."<ref name=benner3>Benner (1983), pp. 3&ndash;4.</ref>

Shortly after Ross's birth, his parents sold their Iowa property and returned to Cameron,<ref name=davis149/> where they received 640&nbsp;ha) of land along the Little River.<ref name=benner5and6/> The area in which they lived adjoined Comanche territory, and the family survived several Indian raids.<ref name=benner5and6>Benner (1983), pp. 5&ndash;6.</ref><ref name=sterling284>Sterling (1959), p. 284.</ref>

In 1845, the family moved to Austin so Ross and his older siblings could attend school.<ref>Benner (1983), p. 9.</ref>  Four&nbsp;years later, they relocated again.  By this time Shapley Ross had acquired a good reputation as a frontiersman, and to coax him to settle in the newly-formed community of Waco, the family was given four city lots, exclusive rights to operate a ferry across the Brazos River, and the right to buy 80&nbsp;acres (32&nbsp;ha) of farmland at US$1 per acre.<ref>Benner (1983), p. 10.</ref><ref name=davis151>Davis (1989), p. 151.</ref>  In March 1849, the Ross family built the first house in Waco, a double-log cabin on a bluff overlooking the springs.  Ross's sister Kate soon became the first white child to be born in Waco.<ref name=davis151/>

Eager to further his education, Ross entered the Preparatory Department at Wesleyan University in Florence, Alabama.<ref name=sterling284/><ref name=benner19/>  The Wesleyan faculty originally deemed his mathematics knowledge so lacking that they refused his admittance; the decision was rescinded after a professor agreed to tutor Ross privately in the subject.<ref name=benner19>Benner (1983), p. 19.</ref>  At Wesleyan, students lived with prominent families instead of congregating in dormitories,<ref name=davis152/> thus giving them "daily exposure to good manners and refinement".<ref name=davis153>Davis (1989), p. 153.</ref>  Ross lived with the family of his tutor.<ref name=davis153/>

==Wichita Village fight==
During the summer of 1858, Ross returned to Texas and journeyed to the Brazos Indian Reserve, where his father served as Native Americans from the reservation were expected to join the U.S. Army in searching for Buffalo Hump, a Comanche warrior leading deadly raids on Texas settlements.  Fearing that Shapley Ross was too ill to command them on the mission, the Indians named Lawrence Sullivan Ross their new war chief.  With his father's approval, the younger Ross led the 135&nbsp;warriors to meet U.S. Cavalry troops commanded by Captain Earl van Dorn.<ref name=benner212325/><ref name=mayhall217>Mayhall (1971), p. 217.</ref>  Ross was given the courtesy title of "Captain" during his command.<ref name=benner212325>Benner (1983), pp. 21, 23, 25.</ref>

Native scouts found approximately 500&nbsp;Comanches, including Buffalo Hump, camped outside a Wichita village in Indian Territory.  After Ross and his men successfully stampeded the Comanche horses to leave the warriors at a disadvantage, he and three&nbsp;others chased a party of fugitives.  The fugitives were women and children, and Ross ordered one of his men to grab a child who appeared to be white.   As they turned to rejoin the battle, they were confronted by 25&nbsp;Comanche warriors.<ref name=benner2629/><ref>Davis (1989), p. 155.</ref>  Two of Ross's men died in the ensuing fight, and Ross received an arrow through his shoulder and a 0.58&nbsp;caliber bullet through the chest.<ref name=benner2629/><ref name=welsh/>  His attacker, a Comanche brave named Mohee whom Ross had known since childhood, was killed by a member of the cavalry as he approached the downed Ross with a scalping knife.<ref name=benner2629>Benner (1983), pp. 26&ndash;29.</ref>

After five&nbsp;hours of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance.<ref name=mayhall218>Mayhall (1971), p. 218.</ref><ref name=benner3033/>  Buffalo Hump had escaped, but seventy&nbsp;Comanches had been killed.<ref name=mayhall218/>  Ross's injuries were severe, and for five&nbsp;days he laid under a tree on the battlefield, unable to be moved.<ref name=welsh></ref><ref name=benner3033/>  His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill him so he would no longer feel the pain.  When he was able to travel, he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules, and then on the shoulders of his men.  He recovered fully, but experienced some pain for much of the rest of the year.<ref name=welsh/>   

In his written report, van Dorn praised Ross highly.  The ''Dallas Herald'' printed the report on October 10, and other state newspapers also praised Ross's bravery.  General Winfield Scott learned of Ross's role and offered him a direct commission in the Army.  Eager to finish his education, Ross declined Scott's offer and returned to school in Alabama.<ref name=benner3033>Benner (1983), pp. 30–33.</ref><ref>Davis (1989), p. 157.</ref>

Ross graduated from Wesleyan with an Bachelor of Arts in 1859 and returned to Texas.  Once there, he discovered that no one had been able to trace the family of the young white girl who had been rescued during the battle.  He adopted the child and named her Lizzie Ross, in honor of his new fiancée, Lizzie Tinsley.<ref>Benner (1983), p. 37. Davis (1989), p. 156.</ref>

==Texas Rangers==
===Enlistment===
In early 1860, Ross enlisted in Captain J. M. Smith's Waco company of Texas Rangers, which formed to fight the renegade Indians.  Smith appointed Ross his second lieutenant.  When Smith was promoted, the other men in the company unanimously voted to make Ross the new captain.  In conjunction with several other Ranger companies, Ross led his men to avenge two families who had been murdered by members of a Kickapoo tribe.  The tribe had been warned of the Rangers' approach and set the prairie ablaze.  The Rangers were forced to abandon their mission when confronted with the massive wildfire.<ref>Benner (1983), pp. 38, 40, 42.</ref>

Smith disbanded Ross's company in early September 1860.  Within a week, Governor Sam Houston authorized Ross to raise his own company of  to protect the settlements near Belknap from Indian attacks.  Ross and his men arrived at Fort Belknap on October 17, 1860 to find that the local citizens they were sworn to protect had passed a resolution asking Ross to resign his commission and leave the frontier.  The citizens erroneously believed that the raiding was committed by Indians from the reservations, and they feared that Ross's friendship with the reservation Indians would make him ineffective.<ref>Benner (1983), pp. 47&ndash;48.</ref>

===Battle of Pease River===

In late October and November, the Comanches, led by Peta Nocona, conducted numerous raids on various settlements, culminating in the brutal killing of a pregnant woman.  On hearing of these incidents, Houston sent several 25-men companies to assist Ross.  A citizen's posse had tracked the raiders to their winter village along the Pease River.  As the village contained at least 500&nbsp;warriors and many women and children, the posse returned to the settlements to recruit additional fighters.  Ross requested help from the U.S. Army at Camp Cooper, which sent 21&nbsp;troops.<ref>Benner (1983), pp. 49&ndash;50.</ref>

Immediately after the soldiers arrived on December 11, Ross and 39&nbsp;Rangers departed for the Comanche village.  On December 13 they met the civilian posse, which had grown to 69&nbsp;members.  After several days of travel, the fast pace and poor foraging forced the civilians to stop and rest their horses.  The Rangers and soldiers continued on.  When they neared the village, Ross personally scouted ahead.  Hidden from view by a dust storm, he was able to get within  of the village and saw signs that the tribe was preparing to move on.  Realizing that his own horses were too tired for a long pursuit, Ross resolved to attack immediately, before the civilians were able to rejoin the group.  He would lead the Rangers down the ridge, while the soldiers would circle around and cut off the Comanche retreat.<ref>Benner (1983), pp. 50&ndash;53.  Davis (1989), p. 160.</ref>

After fierce fighting, the Comanches realized they could not win and fled.  Ross and several of his men pursued the chief who had been giving orders and a second, unknown, rider.  As the Rangers neared, the second rider slowed and held a child over her head; the men did not shoot, but instead surrounded and stopped her.  Ross continued to follow the chief, eventually shooting him three&nbsp;times.  The chief refused to surrender, even after falling from his horse.  Ross's cook, Anton Martinez, who had been taken captive in Mexico after Nocona killed his family, identified the captured chief as Nocona.  With Ross's permission, Martinez fired the shot that took Nocona's life.<ref>Benner (1983), p. 54.</ref>  Nocona was the only Comanche male to die in the fighting; thirteen&nbsp;Comanche women were also killed.  Ross's men suffered no deaths or injuries.<ref>Davis (1989), p. 162.</ref>
thumb|right|Ross helped to rescue [[Cynthia Ann Parker and her daughter, shown in 1861.]]
The civilian posse arrived at the battleground as the fighting finished.  Although they initially congratulated Ross for winning the battle, some of them later complained that Ross had pushed ahead without them so that he would not have to share the glory or the spoils of war.<ref name=brenner56>Benner (1983), p. 56.</ref>

When Ross arrived back at the campground, he discovered that the captured woman had blue eyes.<ref name=brenner56/>  The woman could not speak English and did not know her name or where she came from. After much questioning, she remembered a few details of her capture as a child.  The details matched what Ross knew of the Fort Parker Massacre of 1836, so he sent the woman to Camp Cooper and summoned Colonel Isaac Parker to identify her.  When Parker mentioned that his kidnapped niece had been named Cynthia Ann Parker, the woman slapped her chest and said "Me Cincee Ann."<ref name=brenner57>Benner (1983), p. 57.</ref>  Parker never returned to the Comanche people, but was not happy to have been rescued by Ross.<ref>Hendrickson (1995), p. 113.</ref>    

The Battle of Pease River cemented Ross's fame.  His "aggressive tactics of carrying the war to the Comanche fireside (as it had long been carried to that of the white) ended charges of softness in dealing with the Indians."<ref name=brenner57/>  After Ross's death, however, Nocona's son Quanah Parker maintained that his father was not present at the battle, and instead died three or four years later.  Quanah Parker identified the man Martinez shot as a Mexican captive who was the personal servant of Nocona's wife, Cynthia Ann Parker.<ref>Davis (1989), p. 161.</ref>

While leaving the Pease River area, Ross discovered a nine-year-old Indian boy hiding alone in the tall grass.  Ross took the child with him, naming him Pease.  Though Pease was later given the choice to return to his people, he always refused and was raised by Ross.<ref>Benner (1983), p.55.</ref>

===Resignation===
When Ross returned home, Houston asked him to disband the company and form a new company of 83&nbsp;men, promising to send written directives soon.  While Ross was in the process of supervising this reorganization, Houston appointed Captain William C. Dalrymple as his new aide-de-camp with overall command of the Texas Rangers.  Dalrymple, unaware of Houston's verbal orders, castigated Ross for disbanding his company.  Ross completed the reorganization of the company, then returned to Waco and resigned his commission.  In his letter of resignation, effective February 1861, Ross informed Houston of his encounter with Dalrymple, and noted that he did not believe a Ranger company could be effective if the captain did not report solely to the Governor.  Houston offered to appoint Ross as an aide-de-camp with the rank of colonel, but Ross refused.<ref>Benner (1983), pp.58&ndash;60.</ref>

==Civil War service==
===Enlistment===
In early 1861, after Texas had voted to secede from the United States and join the Confederacy, Ross's brother Peter resigned from the Texas Rangers and returned to Waco "to raise a company for war service."<ref name=benner63>Benner (1983), pp. 63&ndash;64.</ref>  Ross enlisted in his brother's company as a private. On Edward Clark asked Ross to proceed immediately to Indian Territory to negotiate with the reservation Indians.  Clark hoped that Ross could sign treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes so that they would not help the Union Army. One week after his May 28 wedding to Lizzie Tinsley, Ross set out for Indian Territory.<ref name=benner63/>  Upon reaching the Washita Agency, he discovered that Confederate commissioners had already signed a preliminary treaty with the tribes, so he returned home.<ref>Benner (1983), p. 65.</ref><ref>Davis (1989), p. 164.</ref>

Ross left for General McCulloch, whom he had served alongside in the Texas Rangers, to lead a scouting force near Springfield, Missouri.  Both times, Ross successfully slipped behind the Union Army lines, gathered information, and retreated before being caught.  After completing the missions, he was granted a 60-day leave and returned home to visit his wife.<ref name=benner72>Benner (1983), p. 72.  Wooster (2000), p. 213.</ref>

===Active duty===
In early 1862, Ross returned to duty. By late February, he and 500 other troops were assigned to raid the Union Army.  He led the group  behind the enemy lines, where they gathered intelligence, destroyed several wagonloads of commissary supplies, captured 60&nbsp;horses and mules, and took 11&nbsp;prisoners.<ref name=benner72/>   The following month, the regiment was assigned to Earl van Dorn, now a Major General, whom Ross had served with during the battle at the Wichita village.  Under van Dorn, the group suffered a defeat at the Des Arc, Memphis, lb (57&nbsp;kg).<ref>Benner (1983), p. 115.</ref>

Over Ross's protests, the men of the Sixth Regiment elected him colonel in 1862.  He did not want the responsibility of the position, and had not wanted to embarrass a friend who wanted the job.  Their brigade commander, General Charles W. Phifer, was often absent, leaving Ross in charge.  Ross's actions impressed other officers, and several times during the summer of 1862 he was nominated for promotion to brigadier general. Although he was not promoted at that time, his unit was the only one of the 8&ndash;10 dismounted cavalry units in the area to be promised the return of their horses.<ref>Benner (1983), pp. 79, 80.</ref>

Before the horses could arrive, Ross and his men participated in the Hatchie's Bridge. Ross led 700&nbsp;rifleman to engage the Union troops.  For three&nbsp;hours, his men held off 7,000&nbsp;Union troops, repulsing three major enemy assaults.<ref>Benner (1983), p. 87.</ref>

The Sixth Cavalry's horses arrived soon after the battle, and the regiment was transferred to the cavalry brigade of Colonel William H. "Red" Jackson.  Ross was permitted to take a few weeks leave in November 1862 to visit his wife, and returned to his regiment in mid-January 1863.<ref>Benner (1983), p. 88.</ref>  Several months later, he and his men participated in the Battle of Thompson's Station.<ref>Wooster (2000), p. 214.</ref> In July, Major General Stephen D. Lee joined the Sixth Texas Cavalry with Colonel R.A. Pinson's First Mississippi Cavalry, creating a new brigade with Ross at the helm.  Near the same time, Ross received word that his first child had died, possibly stillborn.<ref>Benner (1983), p 92.</ref>

Ross fell ill again in September 1863. From September 27 through March 1864, he suffered recurring attacks of fever and chills every three&nbsp;days, symptomatic of tertian malaria.<ref name=welsh/><ref>Benner (1983), p. 116.</ref> Despite his illness, Ross never missed a day of duty, and in early 1864 he was promoted to brigadier general, becoming the ninth-youngest general officer of the Confederate Army.<ref name=welsh/><ref>Benner (1983), p. 93.</ref>  Following his promotion, unit morale improved, and every one of his men re-enlisted.<ref name=benner103>Benner (1983), p. 103.</ref><ref>Davis (1989), p. 169.</ref>

In March 1864, Ross's brigade fought against black soldiers for the first time at Yazoo City, Mississippi. After bitter fighting, the Confederates were victorious.  During the surrender negotiations, the Union officer accused the Texans of murdering several captured black soldiers.  Ross claimed that two of his men had likewise been killed after surrendering to Union troops.<ref name=wooster215>Wooster (2000), p. 215.</ref>

Beginning in May, the brigade endured 112&nbsp;consecutive days of skirmishes, comprising 86 separate clashes with the enemy. Though most of the skirmishes were small, by the end of the period injuries and desertion had cut the regiment's strength by 25%.<ref name=benner103/><ref name=wooster215/> Ross was captured in late July at the Battle of Brown's Mill, but was quickly rescued by a successful Confederate cavalry counterattack.<ref name=wooster215/>

Their last major military campaign was the Franklin-Nashville Campaign of November and December 1864. Ross and his men led the Confederate advance into Tennessee. Between the beginning of November and December 27, his men captured 550&nbsp;prisoners, several hundred horses, and enough overcoats and blankets to survive the winter chill. Only 12 of Ross's men were killed, with 70&nbsp;wounded and 5&nbsp;captured.<ref>Benner (1983), pp. 108, 109, 111.</ref>

===Surrender===
By the time Ross began a 90-day furlough on Jackson, Andrew Johnson's amnesty proclamation of May 29, 1865.  In order to prevent his arrest and the confiscation of his property, Ross had to apply for a special pardon for his treason against the United States.  He applied for amnesty on August 4, 1865. Johnson personally approved Ross's application on October 22, 1866, but Ross did not receive and formally accept the pardon until July 1867.<ref>Benner (1983), pp. 116, 117.</ref>

==Farming and early public service==
When the Civil War ended, Ross was just 26 years old. He owned 160&nbsp;acres (65&nbsp;ha) of farmland along the South Bosque River west of Waco, and 5.41&nbsp;acres (2.2&nbsp;ha) in town.  For the first time, he and his wife were able to establish their own home.   They expanded their family by having eight&nbsp;children over the next seventeen&nbsp;years.<ref>Benner (1983), pp. 117, 119.</ref>

Despite his federal pardon for being a Confederate general, Ross was disqualified from voting and serving as a juror by the first Reconstruction Act of March 2, 1867. This act, and the Supplementary Reconstruction Act passed three&nbsp;weeks later, disenfranchised anyone who had held a federal or state office before supporting the Confederacy. Because Ross had served in the Texas Rangers, he was disqualified from voting.<ref>Benner (1983), p. 119.</ref>

Reconstruction did not harm Ross's fortune, and with hard work he soon prospered. Shortly after the war ended, he bought 20&nbsp;acres (8&nbsp;ha) of land in town from his parents for $1,500.  By May 1869 he had purchased an additional 40&nbsp;acres (16&nbsp;ha) of farmland for $400, and the following year his wife inherited 186&nbsp;acres (80&nbsp;ha) of farmland from the estate of her father. Ross continued to buy land, and by the end of 1875 he owned over 1,000&nbsp;acres (405&nbsp;ha) of farmland.<ref>Benner (1983), p. 120.</ref> Besides farming, Ross and his brother Peter also raised trail drives to New Orleans. The combined farming and ranching incomes left Ross wealthy enough to build a house in the Waco city limits and to send his children to private school.<ref>Davis (1989), p. 171.</ref>

'''Lawrence Sullivan Ross''' (* Trinity River, Texas) war ein General, Universitäts-Präsident und der 20. Gouverneur von Texas.

Ross wurde 1838 als zweiter Sohn und viertes Kind von Shapley Prince und Catherine Ross, geb. Fulkerson, im Iowa-Territorium geboren. Seine Eltern waren 1834 von Austin, wo seine älteren Geschwister zur Schule gingen und schließlich 1849 nach Independence und dann am ''Florence Wesleyan College'', der heutigen Florence, Alabama, wo er 1859 sein Studium erfolgreich abschloss. Da er bereits seine Ferienzeiten meist als Freiwilliger beim Militär verbracht hatte, war es nicht verwunderlich, dass er sich danach für eine Karriere entschieden hatte.

Noch im gleichen Jahr nahm er an verschiedenen Kämpfen gegen Indianer teil und Konföderierten, wo er 1864 Brigadegeneral und Kommandeur der texanischen Kavallerie-Brigade, auch Ross-Brigade genannt, wurde. Während des Sezessionskriegs hat er an 135 Schlachten teilgenommen.

thumb|120px|left|Lawrence Sullivan Ross
Nach dem Krieg ließ sich zusammen mit der bereits am 28. Mai 1861 geheirateten Elizabeth Dorothy Tinsley, Tochter eines Plantagenbesitzers bei Waco, als Farmer in Texas nieder. 1873 wurde er zum Sheriff des Demokraten aufstellen und gewann auch diese Wahl. Am 18. Januar 1887 übernahm er dieses Amt von John Ireland und, nachdem er 1888 nochmals gewählt wurde, blieb zwei volle Wahlperioden bis zum 20. Januar 1891 im Amt. Sein Nachfolger als Gouverneur wurde Jim Hogg.
