'''雕鸮'''，学名''Bubo bubo''，属于鸱鸮科雕鸮属，又名鹫兔、怪鸱、角鸱、恨狐、老兔。

==生态环境==
雕鸮栖息在山中林间，裸露的岩石或悬崖上，属夜行性鸟类，白天在藏身处休息，晚上才外出活动。

==分布地域==
雕鸮是分布非常广泛的物种，在整个欧亚大陆均可见到本物种，北起斯堪的纳维亚半岛，东至库页岛，南达撒哈拉沙漠南缘、伊朗、印度北部，西抵整个欧洲；在中国全国可见。

==特征==
雕鸮是分布及其广泛的物种，亚种分化也极多，据统计，雕鸮有多达41个亚种，当然不同学派的学者对亚种的分化有不同的标准，这41个亚种并不是所有鸟类学者共同认同的。不同的亚种有着不同的外形特征，但作为一个物种，这些物种有着共同的特征。雕鸮是体形最大的鸮形目鸟类，体长可达80厘米以上。类似其他鸮形目鸟类，雕鸮体色暗哑，隐蔽性很强，具面盘和耳羽但面盘得边界不似长耳鸮等其他常见中性鸮类那般明显，耳羽很长，呈簇状并向水平方向伸展；体羽以棕褐色为基调，上背和翅上的羽毛具大块黑斑，腹部羽毛具幼细的深褐色横纹和由深褐色羽干形成的粗大纵纹。双腿被羽，甚至延伸到趾，这令本物种看起来极其粗旷有力。虹膜为橙黄；喙灰色；脚黄色。在受到惊吓的时候，本物种会耸起肩双，将双翅半开于体侧，并不断转身使自己正对侵入者，半开的双翅诈看起来就像是其头部的一部分，这颗硕大的“脑袋”非常吓人，同时它还会用力击打上下喙，发出清脆的咔吧咔吧声，以示警告，这种状态是雕鸮的最后通牒，遇到这种状态的雕鸮，切记绝对不能进一步惊扰它，否则会遭到它的攻击。

==食物==
所有的鸮型目鸟类均为典型的肉食性鸟类，雕鸮的食物以各种鼠类为主，通过分析他们的唾餘，人们发现雕鸮的食谱以黑线姬鼠为主，还包括小家鼠、大足鼠、褐家鼠、社鼠等。

==繁殖与保护==
本物种最早在12月就开始寻找配偶，在这个阶段雄性和雌性会相互接近并表现出相互梳理羽毛、对唱、相互亲吻等行为，经过3－5天感情酝酿之后开始交配。雕鸮筑巢于峭壁中突出岩石上，巢甚简单，仅为雌鸟用脚爪在地上刨出来得一个小坑，甚至没有任何填充物，仅在产卵后垫以少量的羽毛。每巢产卵3－5枚，由雌鸟负责孵化，雏鸟为晚成雏。

*中国国家重点保护等级： 二级 生效年代：1989年
*中国濒危动物红皮书等级： 稀有 生效年代：1996年 
*濒危因素：本物种受到灭鼠运动和非法捕猎的威胁，草原上开展的灭鼠运动大量使用高毒高残留的鼠药，对以老鼠为食的雕鸮遭受到严重的影响；此外中医理论认为去羽毛及內臟的雕鸮全体，有解毒、定惊、祛风湿的功效，刺激本物种作为药物的非法捕猎。

The '''Eurasian Eagle Owl''' (''Bubo bubo'') is a species of horned owl resident in much of Europe and Asia.

==Characteristics==
The Eagle Owl is a large and powerful bird, smaller than the Golden Eagle but larger than the Snowy Owl. It has a wingspan of up to 200 cm (5-7 feet). Adult females can weigh in excess of 4 kg (9 lb), in comparison the common Barn Owl weighs about 500 grams (1.1 lb). It mainly feeds on small mammals, but can kill prey up to the size of foxes and young deer (up to 10 kg/22 lb), if taken by surprise. Larger prey (over 3 kg/7 lb) is consumed on the ground which leaves the bird vulnerable (for example to other foxes).

The call of the Eagle Owl is  a deep resonant “ooh-hu” with emphasis on the first syllable for the male, and a more high-pitched uh-Hu for the female (in German, the name of this bird is "Uhu"). Each member of an Eagle Owl population can be  identified by means of its vocalizations. <!-- unpublished ?? <ref>Grava T., Mathevon N., Place E. and Balluet P. Individual Acoustic monitoring of the European eagle Owl. Submitted.</ref> -->

The size, ear tufts and orange eyes make this a distinctive species. It has a strong direct flight. The difference between the male and female is that male's ear tufts are more upright than the female's.

The horned owls are a part of the larger grouping of owls known as the typical owls, Strigidae, which contains most species of owl. The other grouping is the barn owls, Tytonidae.

==Habitat==

The Eagle Owl is largely nocturnal and is found in mountains and forests with cliffs and rocky areas, usually nesting on cliff ledges. They live for around 20 years although like many other bird species in captivity they can live much longer, perhaps up to 60 years.

Although Eagle Owls are usually considered to be a bird of the great wilderness, they have been observed hunting vermin on open landfills in Northern Europe. This poses a certain risk for the owls as any pollutants the rats they feed on have ingested may be enriched in the owls. Eagle Owls that hunt on landfills have also sometimes been seen flying with waste entangled around their feet.

Eagle Owls have also been observed living in European cities. Since 2005, at least five couples have nested in released pet rabbits. In June 2007, an Eagle Owl nick-named 'Bubi' landed in the crowded Finland's national football team have had the nickname ''Huuhkajat'' (Finnish for ''Eurasian Eagle-owls'') ever since. The owl was named "Helsinki Citizen of the Year" in December 2007.<ref> [http://www.hs.fi/kaupunki/artikkeli/Bubista+vuoden+kaupunkilainen/1135232674034 Palkittu Bubi käväisi yllättäen palkitsemistilaisuudessa - HS.fi - Kaupunki<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Recent UK breeding==

The Eagle Owl was not considered to be naturally resident in Ministry of Defence land in North Yorkshire.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/north_yorkshire/4436122.stm "Giant Owl returns after Centuries"], BBC News</ref> There was some debate as to whether these birds were escapees or whether they have arrived naturally from the continent, which would only be a short journey from either France or Scandinavia. At the time the program was made, they had reared 20 young to independence, and three young were in the nest. Nothing was known of what happened to those 20 young, except that one of them electrocuted itself on power lines in Shropshire. 

Another bird has been sighted several times in Heaton, Bolton, Lancashire. This bird was reported to have died in mid April 2007 due to secondary poisoning, perhaps from eating a contaminated dead rodent.<ref>[http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/mostpopular.var.1184267.mostviewed.rare_owl_spotted_in_bolton.php "Rare Owl spotted in Bolton"], Bolton News - URL accessed February 27th, 2007.</ref>
The BBC reported a pair nesting and aggressively protecting their brood from dog-walkers on a nearby footpath in Lancashire, England, in late May 2007.

However, a more recent BBC TV programme (2007) reported that the Eagle Owl is becoming more common in the UK and is showing signs that it is becoming established, mirroring the recent rapid increase in the Buzzard population with which it shares some similarities, particularly prey and habitat.
