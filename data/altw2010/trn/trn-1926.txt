From 30 December 1970 to 1977, he served as Deputy Director of Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the USSR Academy of Sciences.

Primakov became involved in politics in 1989, as the chairman of the Union Soviet, one of two houses of the Soviet parliament. From 1990 until 1991 he was a member of Soviet leader putsch attempt, Primakov was appointed First Deputy Chairman of the SVR, serving in that position from 1991 until 1996.

==Foreign minister==
Primakov served as foreign minister from January 1996 until September 1998 . As foreign minister, he gained respect at home and abroad as a tough but pragmatic supporter of Russia's interests, and an opponent of NATO's expansion into the former Eastern bloc, though on May 27, 1997, after 5 months of negotiation with NATO Secretary general Javier Solana, Russia signed the [http://www.nato.int/docu/basictxt/fndact-a.htm Foundation Act], which is seen as marking the end of cold war hostilities.

He was also famously an advocate of Samuel Huntington calls this an antihegemonic coalition in an essay entitled [http://homepages.stmartin.edu/Fac_Staff/rlangill/PLS%20300/The%20Lonely%20Superpower.htm 'The Lonely Superpower'].

==Prime minister==
After Yeltsin's bid to reinstate Viktor Chernomyrdin as Russian prime minister was blocked by the Duma in September 1998, the President turned to Primakov as a compromise figure whom he rightly judged would be accepted by the parliament's majority. As prime minister, Primakov was given credit for forcing some very difficult reforms in Russia, most of them, such as the tax reform, became major success. While his opposition to the US Unilateralism was popular among Russians, it also led to a disastrous breach with the West during NATO's campaign in Kosovo, which ultimately left Russia alone in subsequent developments in the former Yugoslavia. 

Analysts ascribed Yeltsin's May 12, 1999 firing of Primakov as a reaction to his fear of losing power to a more successful and popular person. Primakov also refused to dismiss Communist ministers as the Communist Party of the Russian Federation was leading the process of preparing unsuccessful impeachment proceedings against the president. However, Yeltsin resigned at the end of the year and was succeeded by the prime minister of that time, Vladimir Putin.

==Deputy and special representative==
Before Yeltsin’s resignation, Primakov supported the Unity) and launched his presidential bid. Initially considered the man to beat, Primakov was rapidly overtaken by the factions loyal to presidential elections. Soon he became an adviser to Putin and a political ally. On December 14 2001, Primakov became President of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

In February and March 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a move which received some support from several nations opposed to the war. Primakov suggested that Saddam must hand over all Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to the United Nations, among other things.<ref name="Bodansk"> Yossef Bodansky ''The Secret History of the Iraq War''. Regan Books, 2005, ISBN 0-060-73680-1 </ref> "Saddam tapped me on the shoulder and went out of the room", Primakov recalled.<ref name="Bodansk"/> Saddam showed strong confidence that nothing terrible will not happen with him personally. In Primakov's opinion, this confidence was the result of Iraqi secret relationship with U.S., and the rapid execution of Saddam did not allow him to "say the last word" to uncover the whole game. "And if he had said all this, I assure you, it was very uncomfortable to sit in the President chair for the current President of the United States", Primakov assured.<ref name=vesti7/>
