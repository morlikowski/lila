'''''Let's Go to Bed''''' is the name of a 1982 single by The Cure. It later appeared on their compilation album ''Japanese Whispers''.

In the aftermath of the bleak ''Pornography'', Robert Smith returned from a month-long detox in sarcastic reflection on sexual imagery in pop music, the single was a surprise hit<ref>''The Crack Up'', article in Mojo magazine,  August 2004.</ref>. It was most successful in Australia, reaching #15.

== History ==

The origins of "Let's Go to Bed" lie in "Temptation", one of the demos for ''Pornography''. The song is a relatively upbeat, guitar-driven instrumental. In August of 1982, soon after Simon Gallup's departure from the band, Smith demoed a vocal version of the track, entitled "Temptation Two", a psychedelic piece not far removed from the last album but somewhat lighter in tone. At the end of the song, Smith sings a string of wordless syllables, nearly identical to the "doo doo doo"s of the later song. The final version was debuted on Kid Jensen's radio show on 27 November, 1982.

Robert Smith has often stated that he wished its b-side, the darker "Just One Kiss" (also first performed during the session) was released as a single.

The song was covered by Ivy for their 2002 album "Guestroom". The video for the cover was shot, showcasing New York streets and coffeeshops. The Smashing Pumpkins' James Iha, known for his love for and his own covers of The Cure, appeared briefly in the video. American Los Angeles Rock band The Dreaming (US band) covered this song also.
