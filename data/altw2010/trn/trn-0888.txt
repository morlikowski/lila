== Jméno ==
V nejstarších dobách se město nazývalo ''Iader'' (nijak nesovisí se jménem moře), později ''Diadora''. Druhé -''a''- ve slově Zadar je pohyblivé, takže správné skloňování je ''do Zadru'', ''v Zadru'' atp. Použití tvaru ''Zadaru'' je však v češtině též přípustné. V dřívějších dobách se pro Zadar užívalo také italského názvu ''Zara''.

== Historie ==
Už v době ilyrským kmenem Liburnů. V dobách těsně před přelomem našeho letopočtu Zadar připadl do správy Římské říše, kde však měl svojí autonomii. Po pádu západořímské říše se stal centrem Dalmátské provincie ve Východořímské (Byzantské) říši a sídlem jejího správce. Po vpádu Slovanů do Chorvaté, kteří Zadar s přestávkami ovládali. Dalmácii říkali Benátkami, po několika útocích ale prohrál a byl vypleněn vojsky Benátek a čtvrté křížové výpravy. Následovalo několik Jugoslávskou lidovou armádou, která dva roky obléhala město.

==Place names==

To avoid confusion and in line with convention, this article uses modern English place names throughout. However, most places have alternate names in Italian. See List of Italian place names in Dalmatia.

== Name ==
In the Antique names of the city ''Iadera'' and ''Iader'' much older roots were hidden, of a name the most probably related to a hydrographical term. It was coined by an ancient Mediterranean people and their Pre-Indo-European language. They transmitted it to the later settlers, Greek inscription from Pharos (Stari grad) on the island of Hvar in 384 BC, where the citizens of Zadar were noted as  (''Iadasinoi''). According to the Greek source Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax the city was  (''Idassa''), probably a vulgar Greek form of the original Liburnian name. 

During Antiquity the name was often recorded in sources in Latin in two forms: ''Iader'' in the inscriptions and in the writings of classic writers, ''Iadera''  predominantly among the late Antiquity writers, while usual ethnonyms were ''Iadestines'' and ''Iadertines''. The accent was on the first syllable in both Iader and Iadera forms, which influenced the early-Medieval Dalmatian language forms ''Jadra'', ''Jadera'' and ''Jadertina'', where the accent kept its original place. 

In the Dalmatian language, ''Jadra'' (''Jadera'') was pronounced ''Zadra'' (''Zadera''), due to the phonetic transformation of ''Ja''- to ''Za''-. That early change was also reflected in the Croatian name ''Zadar'', developed from ''Zadъrъ'' by vocalizations of the semi-vowel and a shift to male gender. An ethnonym graphic ''Jaderani'' from the legend of St. Krševan in 9th century, was identical to the initial old-Slavic form ''Zadъrane'', or Renaissance Croatian ''Zadrani''. 

The Dalmatian names ''Jadra'', ''Jadera'' were transferred to other languages; in Tuscan ''Giara'', Latin ''Diadora'' (DAI, 10th century), Arabic ''Jadora'' (Al-Idrisi, 12th century), ''Iadora'' (Guido, 12th century), Spanish ''Jazara'', ''Jara'', ''Sarra'' (14th century) and the others.

Jadera became Zara when it fell under the authority of the Republic of Venice in the 15th century.
Zara was later used by the Austrian Empire in the 19th century, but it was provisionally changed to Zadar from 1910 to 1920 and finally in 1945.<ref>Mate Suić: ''O imenu Zadra'', Zadar Zbornik, Matica Hrvatska, Zagreb 1964</ref> <ref>M.Suić: Prošlost Zadra 1, ''Zadar u starom vijeku'', Filozofski Fakultet Zadar, 1981</ref>

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
The entire district of present day Zadar has been populated since prehistoric times. The earliest evidence of human life comes from the Late pre-Indo-European culture. They assimilated with the Indo-Europeans who settled between the 4th and 2nd millennium BC into a new ethnical unity, that of the Liburnians, who were outlined materially in 9th century BC.

=== Antiquity ===
In the Greeks and safe port for the swift Liburnian galleys. Its population at that time is estimated at 2,000. 

The people of Iadera, the ''Iadasinoi'' were first mentioned in 384 BC as the allies of the Pharos in the island of Syracusan fleet of ''Dionysus'' was informed and attacked the siege fleet. The naval victory was taken by the Greeks which allowed them relatively safer further colonization in the southern Adriatic.

In the middle of the Romans began to gradually invade the region. After legionary veterans) and was granted the title ''Iulia'' after its founder – ''colonia Iulia Iader''. From the early days of Roman domination, Iader gained its urban character and developed into the one of the most flourishing centres on the eastern Adriatic coast, which lasted for several hundred years, until waves of marauding tribes battered the region. By some estimations, in the 4th century it had probably around ten thousand citizens, including the population from its ''agrar'', the nearby islands and hinterland, an admixture of the indigenous Liburnians and the Roman colonists. In 441 and 447 Dalmatia was ravaged by the Huns.

=== The Medieval Period ===
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, in 481 Dalmatia bacame part of the Ostrogothic kingdom, which already included the more northerly parts of Illyricum, i.e. Pannonia and Noricum. 
In 536 the Justinian the Great started a military campaign to reconquer the territories of the former Western Empire (see Gothic War); consequently Zadar became part of the Byzantine Empire.<ref name=Illyria>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Illyria Britannica 1911: Illyria]</ref>

In 568 Dalmatia was devastated by an Avar invasion, and throughout the century Slavs (i.e. early Croatian and Serbian tribes), its modern occupants, gradually established themselves in Illyria, where, unlike the earlier barbarian conquerors, they formed permanent settlements. Between 600 and 650 the main body of the immigrants occupied Illyria.<ref name=Illyria/>

In other parts of the Balkan Peninsula, Serbs and Croats quickly absorbed the native population. However, the coastal cities managed to resist immediate cultural assimilation (mostly due to Byzantine influence). This sociologic process was instead to take many centuries to reach completion. Consequently, the rural areas were settled by Croats and Serbs, while the native population, mostly consisting of romanized Illyrians, was either eventually assimilated or migrated to the cities (such as Split, Zadar and Dubrovnik). This gradual, long process took place in the 7th and 8th centuries. Dalmatia was, thus, a region culturally divided between the Romanic Byzantine cities and the Slavic hinterland (though the Slavs did establish coastal cities of their own, such as Šibenik). These two communities were known to harbor dislike for one another, a grievous circumstance which sometimes resulted in disputes.<ref name=Illyria/><ref name=Dalmatia>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Dalmatia Britannica 1911: Dalmatia]</ref> Other Romanic natives (later called Morlachs) took refuge in the mountainous interior of Dalmatia, where they preserved their culture for several centuries.<ref name=Illyria/>

Zadar survived those turbulent times due its strategic position and its strong defensive system and managed to maintain its Roman heritage (such as its dialect of the independent Dalmatian language). <br>
Because of the destruction of Dalmatia's capital Salona and the relocation of its people to nearby Spalatum (Split), Zadar in time became the capital of the Byzantine Theme (administrative unit) of Dalmatia, and was the seat of the imperial Governor. Byzantium, as the protector of Dalmatia enjoyed a strong military and political presence there, due to the persistent threat of invasion by the new Venetian Republic.

However, the geographical position of Zadar suffices to explain the relatively small influence exercised by Byzantine culture throughout the six centuries (535-1102) of Byzantine rule.<ref name=Dalmatia/> It maintained a large degree of autonomy throughout this time. Along with other Dalmatian urban settlements it soon came to resemble a typical medieval commune.

In 806 Dalmatia was briefly occupied by the Pepin, but this was quickly reversed and the cities were given back to Byzantium in 812, by the Treaty of Aachen.<ref name=Dalmatia/>

Meanwhile, the Croatian state formed inland, and trade and political links with Zadar began to develop. Croatian settlers began to arrive, becoming commonplace by the 10th century. In Croatian Kingdom. He also was granted the position of protector of Dalmatia (the cities) by the Byzantine Emperor. He thus politically united the Dalmatian cities with their hinterland for the first time. In 998 Zadar sought Venetian protection against the Neretvian pirates, who had settled near the mouth of the Neretva river.<ref name=Zara>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Zara Britannica 1911: Zara]</ref><ref name=Dalmatia/> 

The Venetians were quick to fully exploit this opportunity: in 998 a fleet commanded by Doge Pietro Orseolo II, after having defeated pirates, landed in Korčula and Lastovo. Dalmatia was taken by surprise and offered little serious resistance. Trogir was the exception and was subjected to Venetian rule only after a bloody struggle, whereas the Republic of Dubrovnik was forced to pay tribute. Pietro proclaimed himself ''Dux Dalmatianorum'' (Duke of the Dalmatians), associating it with his son (carefully agreeing to Byzantine suzerainty).<ref name=Illyria/><ref name=Dalmatia/>

The Croatian kings meanwhile established their own maritime cities, such as Nin and Greek or Latin, and so accentuated the differences between the Romanic and Slavic population.<ref name=Dalmatia/>

=== Rivalry of Venice and Croatia-Hungary in Dalmatia ===
In 1099, the Hungarian king Coloman. In 1105 Zadar recognized his rule.

Zadar was repeatedly invaded by Venice between 1111 and 1154 and then once more between 1160 and 1183.

In 1183 it finally rebelled, pleading to the Pope and to the Croato-Hungarian throne for protection, but in the year 1202 the Doge Enrico Dandolo instructed the crusader army that for late payment (they were to pay the Venetians out of the first spoils they gained in the crusade) they should lay siege to the troublesome Dalmatian capital. Forced by their lack of money the Crusaders agreed and besieged Zadar. The overwhelmed city soon fell back under Venetian rule.
This did not break the spirit of the city, however. Its commerce was suffering due to a lack of autonomy under Venice. They enjoyed considerable autonomy under the distant, much more feudal Croatian-Hungarian kings. A number of insurrections followed (1242-1243, 1320s, 1345-1346) which resulted finally in Zadar coming back under the crown of the Croatian-Hungarian king Louis I by the Treaty of Zadar, in 1358. After the death of Louis, Zadar recognized the rule of king Sigismund, and after him, that of Ladislas Anjou. During his reign Croatia-Hungary was enveloped in a bloody civil war. In 1409, Venice, seeing that Ladislas was about to be defeated, and eager to exploit the situation despite its relative military weakness, offered to buy his "rights" on Dalmatia for a mere 100,000 ducats. Knowing he had lost the region in any case, Ladislas accepted. Zadar was, thus, sold back to the Venetians for a paltry sum.left|thumb|220px|Zadar's "Kopnena Vrata"

=== Venetian Republic (1409-1797) ===
thumb|200 px|The Adriatic in 1560, with Dalmatia and Zadar

In the early 16th century the Ottoman Turks conquered Dalmatia's hinterland and the city became, in essence, a military stronghold protecting Venetian trade in the Adriatic, as well as the administrative centre of the Venetian conquests in Dalmatia.<br /> 
From 1726-1733, part of its territory was settled by Catholic Albanian refugees. That Albanian settlement was called Arbanasi.

=== Napoleonic era (1797-1813) ===
After the fall of Venice (1797) with the Austrian crown and once again became united with the rest of Croatia. In 1806 it was briefly given to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, until in 1809 it was added to the French Illyrian Provinces. In 1813 all Dalmatia was reconquered and brought back under the control of the Austrian Empire.

During this time, it maintained its position as the capital of Dalmatia. <br />
During the Napoleonic era, the first Dalmatian newspaper, ''"Kraglski Dalmatin - Il Regio Dalmata"'' (''"The Royal Dalmatian"''), was printed in the city.

=== Austrian Empire (1815-1918): the age of nationalism ===
After Austrian crown. After 1848, Italian and Slavic nationalism became accentuated and the city became divided between the Croats and the Italians, both of whom founded their respective political parties. There are conflicting sources for both sides claiming to have formed the majority in this period; in general the era saw Slavs grow more than Italians throughout Dalmatia, fostering a neatly distinct national spirit.  

=== Italy (1920-1945) ===
In October 31 1918 the population of Zadar rebelled against Austrian rule and raised the Italian flag and on 4 November 1918 the city was occupied by the Italian army. The Treaty of Rapallo (12 November 1920) gave Zadar with other local territory to Italy. The Zara enclave, a total of 104 sq km, included the city of Zadar, the municipalities of Bocanjaċ, Arbanasi, Črno, part of Diklo (a total of 51 sq. km. of territory and 17,065 inhabitants) and the islands of Lastovo and Palagruža (53 sq km, 1,710 inhabitants). The territory was organized into an Italian province. Zadar remained under Italian sovereignty until 31 October 1944.

=== World War II ===
Germany with limited Italian assistance invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941. Zadar held a force of 9,000 that after limited fighting reached Šibenik and Split on April 15, a mere 2 days before surrender, with civilians having previously been evacuated to Ancona and Pula. Occupying Mostar and Dubrovnik, on April 17 they met invading troops that had started out from Italian-occupied Albania. On April 17 the Yugoslav government surrendered, faced with the Wehrmacht's overwhelming superiority.

Within a few weeks, Treaty of Rome.<br>
The city became the centre of a new Italian province, called Axis and was, thus, considered void. For the rest of the world, and, indeed, the local populace, Dalmatia was under Italian occupation.<br />
Under fascist reign the Slavic population was subjected to a policy of forced assimilation. This created immense resentment among the Yugoslav people and the Yugoslav Partisan movement (which was already successfully spreading in the rest of Yugoslavia) particularly took root here. The Italians used Rab and Gonars camps), and to suppress the mounting resistance led by the Partisans adopted tactics of "summary executions, hostage-taking, reprisals, internments and the burning of houses and villages" <ref>[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rmis/2004/00000009/00000003/art00005 IngentaConnect General Roatta's war against the partisans in Yugoslavia: 1942<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.<br />
After Mussolini was removed from power, the government of surrendered to the Allies, and on "Il Duce" was rescued, however, and formed the Nazi-puppet HNK Hajduk) joined the Partisan movement.<br />
The city was prevented from joining the NDH on the grounds that Zadar itself was not subject to the conditions of the Treaty of Rome. Despite this, the NDH's leader Ante Pavelić designated Zadar as the capital of the Sidraga-Ravni Kotari County, although its administrator was prevented from entering the city. Zadar remained under the local administration of the Italian Social Republic.<br />
Zadar was bombed by the Allies, with serious civilian casualties. Italian sources often claim that this was made in order to 'ethnically cleanse' the ancient town and avoid subsequent troubles for the victorious Titoist army. Thousands died in the Allied carpet bombings, and many landmarks and centuries old works of art were destroyed. Many civilians fled to safety in Italy. <br>
In 1944 the partisans entered the town. The city, resettled by Croatians, successfully recovered and became once more an important regional city in the newly established Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

=== SFR Yugoslavia (1945-1991) ===
During this period Zadar underwent intensive reconstruction and revitalisation, followed by a large increase in both population and economic power. The Federal government sponsored numerous public works to this end, including the tourism came to Dalmatia. 

However, during this period the city lost its status as the capital of the region, with Split overwhelmingly surpassing Zadar in population numbers, which, though increasing throughout the 20th century, boomed in the new, post-WWII, Yugoslavia. 

All in all, by the 1990's the city had not only been rebuilt after the Second World War, but had emerged as a modern and completely industrialized regional centre, with as yet unsurpassed tourist numbers, GDP and employment rates, which were, surprisingly, significantly higher than the present day's.

=== Recent history ===

After the death of Tito, Yugoslavia rapidly began to destabilize. In the early 1990's the tragic Krajina rebels with the protection of the serbianized Yugoslav Navy (JRM) a port on the mainland. Along with other Croatian towns in the area, Zadar was sporadically shelled for several years, which damaged buildings and homes as well as Pag. The the end of the war in 1995.
