'''Guy Fawkes''' (eigentlich '''Guido Fawkes'''; auch ''Faux'' oder ''Faukes'') * Jakob I. versuchte.

== Leben und Bedeutung ==
Guy Fawkes, einziger Sohn von Edward Fawkes und seiner Ehefrau Edith Blake, wurde in Stonegate, Grafschaft Yorkshire, geboren und in der Kirche ''St. Michael-le-Belfry'' getauft. Nach dem Besuch der ''St. Peter's School'' konvertierte er im Alter von 16 Jahren zum Katholizismus.

Fawkes diente viele Jahre lang als Soldat und erlangte dabei Kenntnisse im Umgang mit Sprengstoff. 1593 verdingte er sich in der Armee des Erzherzogs Achtzigjährigen Krieg. 1596 war er bei der Belagerung und Einnahme von Calais beteiligt. Bis 1602 war er zwar nicht über den Rang eines Fähnrichs hinausgekommen, war aber als mutiger und entschlossener Soldat ausgezeichnet worden.

Guy Fawkes, englische Parlament im Palast von Westminster in London in die Luft zu sprengen. Gründe hierfür dürften in der Verfolgung liegen, der sie als Angehörige der katholischen Minderheit ausgesetzt waren. Die Politik der englischen Regierung war zu der Zeit von einem rabiaten Antikatholizismus geprägt. Für das Attentat hatte er bereits 36 Fässer mit mehr als zwei Tonnen Schwarzpulver in den Kellern der Gebäude deponiert (daher auch die englische Bezeichnung '''''Gun Powder Plot''''' für das Attentat), die er zu diesem Zweck als Lagerraum gemietet hatte. Fawkes plante, mit dem Anschlag am Tag der Jakob I. samt Familie, alle Parlamentsmitglieder, alle Bischöfe des Landes und den Großteil des Hochadels zu töten, sowie anschließend einige politische Gefangene aus dem Tower von London zu befreien.

Einer der Mitverschwörer schrieb einen Warnbrief an Lord Monteagle (William Parker, 4. Baron Monteagle), der bei ihm am 26. Oktober einging. Die Verschwörer bekamen Kenntnis von dem Warnbrief, ließen sich jedoch von ihrem Vorhaben nicht abbringen, nachdem Fawkes versichert hatte, dass der Sprengstoff nicht berührt worden sei.

Guy Fawkes und der eingelagerte Sprengstoff wurden dann vom Tower gebrachte Fawkes sein geplantes Verbrechen und nannte auch seine Mitverschwörer, die am 30. Januar 1606 durch Hängen, Ausweiden und Vierteilen hingerichtet wurden. Einen Tag später sollte auch Guy Fawkes hingerichtet werden. Er verkürzte die grausame Strafe, indem er kurz vor dem Hochziehen mit der Schlinge um den Hals vom Galgenpodest sprang und sich das Genick brach.

Bis heute ist in Großbritannien dieses Beinah-Attentat nicht vergessen. Man feiert dieses Ereignis jedes Jahr am 5. November unter dem Namen ''Bonfire Night'' mit einem Straßenumzug, bei dem eine Guy-Fawkes-Puppe verbrannt wird und Feuerwerke entzündet werden. In Großbritannien sagt man auch heute noch scherzhaft, dass Guy Fawkes der einzige Mann sei, der je mit ehrlichen Absichten in das Parlament gegangen ist.

Die jährliche Parlamentseröffnung beginnt bis heute traditionell mit der Inspektion der Kellergewölbe unterhalb des House of Lords durch den Regenten (derzeit Königin Elisabeth&nbsp;II.)

Ein in mehreren Variationen bekannter Kinderreim, eigentlich die erste Strophe eines Liedes, ruft das Ereignis in Erinnerung:

'''Guy Fawkes''' (13 April 1570 – 31 January 1606) sometimes known as '''Guido Fawkes''', was a member of a group of Roman Catholic revolutionaries from England who planned to carry out the Gunpowder Plot.

Although Robert Catesby was the lead figure in thinking up the actual plot, Fawkes was put in charge of executing the plan for his military and explosives experience. The plot was foiled shortly before its intended completion, as Fawkes was captured while guarding the gunpowder.  Suspicion was aroused by his wearing a coat, boots and spurs, as if he intended to leave very quickly.

Fawkes has left a lasting mark on history and Commonwealth) on November 5 is Bonfire Night, centred on the plot and Fawkes. He has been mentioned in popular film, literature and music by people such as Charles Dickens and John Lennon. There are geographical locations named after Fawkes, such as ''Isla Guy Fawkes'' in the Galápagos Islands and Guy Fawkes River in Australia.

==Gunpowder Plot==

Fawkes is notorious for his involvement in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. He was probably placed in charge of executing the plot because of his military and explosives experience. The plot, masterminded by Hugh Owen, a man who was in the pay of the Sir William Stanley is also believed to have recommended him, and Fawkes named him under Thomas Winter in 1603 when Winter was in Continental Europe. Stanley was the commander of the English in the Earl of Leicester had made in the Low Countries. Leicester’s expedition was widely regarded as a disaster, for this reason among others.

The best primary source for the details of the plot itself is the account known as the ''King's Book'' or ''James I The Kings Book - A True and Perfect Relation of the Whole Proceedings Against the Late Most Barbarous Traitors. Robt. Barker, Printer to the Kings Most Excellent Majesty, British Museum 1606''. Although this is a government account, and details have been disputed, it is generally considered to be an accurate record of the history of the plot, and the imprisonment, torture and execution of the plotters. 

The plot itself may have been occasioned by the realisation by Protestant authorities and Catholic recusants that the Kingdom of Spain was in far too much debt and fighting too many wars to assist Catholics in Britain. Any possibility of toleration by Great Britain was removed at the pounds (36 barrels, or 800 kg) of Elizabeth (later Elizabeth of Bohemia, the "Winter Queen"). A few of the conspirators were concerned, however, about fellow Catholics who would have been present at Parliament during the opening. One of the conspirators wrote a warning letter to Lord Monteagle, who received it on 26 October. The conspirators became aware of the letter the following day, but they resolved to continue the plot after Fawkes had confirmed that nothing had been touched in the cellar.

Lord Monteagle had been made suspicious, however; the letter was sent to the Secretary of State, who initiated a search of the vaults beneath the House of Lords in the early morning of 5 November. Peter Heywood, a resident of Heywood, Lancashire, was reputedly the man who snatched the torch from Guy Fawkes’s hand as he was about to light the fuse to detonate the gunpowder. Fawkes, who had resigned himself to blowing himself up along with Parliament, was taken before the privy council where he remained defiant.  When asked by one of the Scottish lords what he had intended to do with so much gunpowder, Fawkes answered him, "To blow you Scotch beggars back to your own native mountains."  

When they asked for his name Guy answered John Johnson. He was tortured over the next few days, after the King granted special permission to do so. James directed that the torture should be light at first, and then more severe. Sir William Wade, Lieutenant of the conspiracy were tried in Westminster Hall. After being found guilty, they were taken to Old Palace Yard in Westminster and St Paul's Yard, where they were hanged, drawn and quartered. Fawkes, however, cheated the hangman by jumping from the scaffold, breaking his neck before he could be drawn and quartered ("The King's Book.",1606.)

== Reaction ==

Many popular contemporary verses were written in condemnation of Fawkes. The most well-known verse begins:

: “Remember, remember the fifth of November,
: The gunpowder, treason and plot,
: I know of no reason
: Why the gunpowder treason
: Should ever be forgot.”
(For the full lyrics see ''Guy Fawkes Night'')

John Rhodes produced a popular narrative in verse describing the events of the plot and condemning Fawkes:

: "Fawkes at midnight, and by torchlight there was found
: With long matches and devices, underground"
