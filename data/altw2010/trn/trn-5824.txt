== Historia ==

Pitcairn uharteek antzinean, polinesiar jatorrizko biztanleak zituzten uhartedira 800 urtearen inguruan ailegatuak. Hauek Pitcairn eta Henderson uharteetan bizi ziren eta urruneko Mangareva uhartetik harreman komertzialak izan zituen. Baina Mangarevaren arazoek komertzioa suntsitu zuten eta uharteen biztanleria bukatu.

Pedro Fernandes de Queirós portugaldarra zela uste da, baina hau ez da fidagarria.

1767an, Pitcairn uhartea berraurkitu zuten, 1790an Bountyko matxinatuek zenbait mendetan uhartean bizitzeko lehendabiziko biztanle bihurtu ziren. 1791en Ducie uhartea aurkitu zen, 1819an Henderson eta 1824an Oeno.

Pitcairn britainiar kolonia bihurtu zen, eta Norfolk uhartera joan zirenean. 18 hilabete geroago, 17 pitcairniar uhartera itzuli ziren. Geroztik biztanle gehien izan duen momentuan 223 ziren, baina gehienak Zelanda Berrira emigratu zirenez, normalean 50 biztanle baino ez dago.

1838an uharteak emakumezko-bozkatze onartzeko lehendabiziko lurraldea zen. 2004ko abenduaren 15an, eskandalua izan zen uhartean, biztanleriaren ehuneko handia pedofilia salatua izan zelako.

==Politika==

Izenez, Pitcairn uharteen gobernatzailea Zelanda Berriko Britainiar Mandatari Gorena da, gaur egun Richard Fell. Baina uhartean bizi ez zenez, eguneroko lana Uharteko Biltzarraren (''Island Council'') presidenteari zegokion. Posturako hauteskendeak hiru urtero egiten ziren. Hala ere, 1998ko erreforma konstituzionala eta gero, bere betebeharrak Pitcairneko alkateari dagozkio 1999 eta gero.

The '''Pitcairn Islands''' (Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands''', are a group of four volcanic islands in the southern British overseas territory (formerly a British colony), the last remaining in the Pacific. Only '''Pitcairn Island''' &mdash; the second largest &mdash; is inhabited. 

The islands are best known for being the home of the descendants of the ''Bounty'' mutineers and the Tahitians who accompanied them, an event retold in numerous books and films. This story is still apparent in the surnames of many of the islanders. With only 48 inhabitants (from nine families), Pitcairn is also notable for being the least populated jurisdiction in the world (although it is not a sovereign nation). The United Nations Committee on Decolonisation includes the Pitcairn Islands on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.<ref>[http://www.un.org/Depts/dpi/decolonization/trust3.htm United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]</ref>

==History==

thumb|left|The mutineers turning Lt Bligh and part of the officers and crew adrift from the [[HMS Bounty|Bounty, 29 April 1789]]
The original settlers of the Pitcairn Islands (Ducie, Henderson, Oeno, and Pitcairn) were Polynesians who appear to have lived on Pitcairn and Henderson for several centuries. However, although archaeologists believe that Polynesians were living on Pitcairn as late as the 15<sup>th</sup> century, the islands were uninhabited when they were discovered by Europeans.<ref>
</ref>

Ducie and Henderson Islands are believed to have been discovered by Europeans on Portuguese sailor Spanish crown, who named them La Encarnación ("Incarnation") and San Juan Bautista ("Saint John the Baptist"), respectively. However, some sources express doubt about exactly which of the islands were visited and named by Queirós, suggesting that Queirós’ La Encarnación may actually have been Henderson Island, and San Juan Bautista may have been Pitcairn Island.<ref> [http://library.puc.edu/Pitcairn/pitcairn/govt-history15.shtml Pitcairn Islands, "History of Government and Laws, Part 15"] 30 September 2006</ref>

Ducie Island was rediscovered in 1791 by the British Capt. Edwards aboard HMS ''Pandora'' and named after Francis, Lord Ducie, a captain in the Royal Navy. It was annexed by Britain on 19 December 1902, and in 1938 it was formally incorporated into Pitcairn to become part of a single administrative unit (the "Pitcairn Group of Islands"). 

Henderson Island was rediscovered on 17 January 1819 by a British Captain Henderson of the British East India Company ship ''Hercules''. On 2 March 1819, Captain Henry King, sailing aboard the ''Elizabeth'', landed on the island to find the king's colours already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship into a tree, and for some years the island's name was Elizabeth or Henderson, interchangeably. Henderson Island was annexed by Britain and incorporated into Pitcairn in 1938.

Oeno Island was discovered on 26 January 1824 by U.S. Captain George Worth aboard the whaler ''Oeno''. On 10 July 1902, Oeno was annexed by Britain. It was incorporated into Pitcairn in 1938.

Pitcairn Island itself was discovered on sloop ''HMS Swallow'', commanded by Captain Philip Carteret (though according to some it had perhaps been visited by Quiros in 1606). It was named after Midshipman Robert Pitcairn, a fifteen-year-old crewmember who was the first to sight the island. Robert Pitcairn was the son of British Marine Officer John Pitcairn.

In 1790, the mutineers of the Bounty and their John Adams and American sailing ship ''Topaz'' found Pitcairn again in 1808, John Adams was granted amnesty for his mutiny.

The island became a British colony in 1838 and was among the first territories to extend voting rights to women. By the mid-1850s the Pitcairn community was outgrowing the island and its leaders appealed to the British government for assistance. They were offered Norfolk Island and on 3 May 1856, the entire community of 193 people set sail for Norfolk on board the ''Morayshire'', arriving on 8 June after a miserable five-week trip. But after eighteen months on Norfolk, seventeen of the Pitcairners returned to their home island; five years later another twenty-seven did the same.

Since a population peak of 233 in 1937, the island has been suffering from emigration, primarily to New Zealand, leaving some fifty people living on Pitcairn.

There are allegations of a long history and tradition of Pitcairn rape trial of 2004''. After the six men lost their final appeal, the British government set up a prison on the island with an annual budget of NZD 950,000. The men began serving their sentences in late 2006, and all are expected to be freed by December of 2008.

==Geography==

The Pitcairn Islands form the southeasternmost extension of the geological Henderson Island and Ducie Island (atoll with 4 islets).

The only permanently inhabited island, Pitcairn, is accessible only by boat through Bounty Bay.

Henderson Island, covering about 67% of the territory's total land area and supporting a rich variety of animals in its nearly inaccessible interior, is also capable of supporting a small human population, but access is difficult, its outer shores comprising steep limestone cliffs of sharp coral.

The Pitcairn Islands were formed by a center of upwelling magma called the Pitcairn hotspot.

The other islands are at a distance of more than 100 km (60 miles) and are not habitable.

==Economy==
The fertile soil of the Pitcairn valleys produces a wide variety of yams, and beans. The inhabitants of this tiny economy exist on fishing, subsistence farming, and handicrafts, with barter being an important part of the economy. The major sources of revenue are the sale of postage stamps to collectors, honey, and the sale of handicrafts to passing ships, most of which are plying the United Kingdom to New Zealand route via the Panama Canal. Trade is restricted by the jagged geography of the island, which lacks a harbour or airstrip, forcing all trade to be made by longboat to visiting ships. Occasionally, passengers from expedition-type cruise ships will come ashore for a day, weather permitting. 

The island has a labour force of 15 men and women (as of 2004). 

==Demographics==

thumb|Pitcairn residents
The majority of the resident Pitcairn Islanders are descendants of the  ''Bounty'' mutineers, as their surnames show, and also have Tahitian ancestry. Most Pitcairners are members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
English, with elements of the Tahitian language. It is spoken as a first language by the population and is taught alongside standard English at the island's only school. It is closely related to the creole language Norfuk spoken on Norfolk Island, because Norfolk was repopulated in the mid nineteenth century by Pitcairners.
