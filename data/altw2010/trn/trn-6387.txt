'''''Saul of the Mole Men''''' is a live action show created by Craig Lewis, writer on ''Land of the Lost'' set in the center of the Earth", the series is directed by Josh Gardner. Gardner is known for his previous collaboration with Stern on the television series, ''Gerhard Reinke's Wanderlust''.  

Craig Lewis' primary inspirations behind this comedic homage to 1970s-era Land of the Lost''), ''Doctor Who'' (Tom Baker-era), and the ''Planet of the Apes'' franchise.

==Plot==
A series promo featured brief introductions for the crew on the use of a subterranean drill module. The team, known as STRATA, included Captain Jim J. James, Lieutenant Jen E. James, Robot, Kiko the Mute Wildboy, and the "rest" of the STRATA action team (which included Saul Malone (Gardner) and Don Rogers, a man with a shovel). The main character, Saul, is seen in the background in many of these scenes. All of the characters are killed within the first few seconds of the first episode, except Saul, Robot, and a revived Johnny Tambourine.

In the season 1 finale, Saul, Clancy, and Stromulus Guandor team up to defeat the Rock Assassins, which are actually Jim J. James and Jen. E. James' bodies combinbed to make a rock monster. With the combined talents of the "Scream of the Birdbats","Moleman Burrowing", and "Rockmaster Tumbling", they defeat the rocks, and Saul's old captains die in peace. Suddenly, they find a spaceship, and everybody, including the floating pancake, clamber on. Clancy even lets his brother, Bertrum, on the ship, while it is still not known how he survived the rock attack in the previous episode. Once the team clambers on, Otnip stops their ship, and Clancy goes out in an apparent suicide mission to blow up Otnip and free the ship. The episode ends as they go into outer space, and the team, led by Saul and Fallopia, with Bertrum, Stromulus, Mrs. Burrows, Li'l Burrows, Nathaniel Baltimore, the floating pancake, and Chinacula the Chinese vampire is re-named Strata-Team Space. Thus ends the season. 

Advertisements began airing on Adult Swim advertising the show as STRATA instead of the original title, making the series appear much like . Subsequent advertisements, however, focus more on Saul and reveal the actual title of the show.

Saul often refers to his hometown of Buffalo, NY and reveals that he studied Geology. Saul's presence is largely funny because of his endearing use of Buffalo English. His love interest is introduced as a creature perceived by locals as hideous and nearly beaten to death by the Mole Men. The beating is interrupted and the creature is revealed to be the lovely Fallopia. The Mole Men's perception of Fallopia's appearance is not unlike the Twilight Zone episode The Eye of the Beholder.
