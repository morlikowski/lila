'''Wuxia''' on kirjallisuudessa ja tyylilaji, joka kuuluu kiinalaiseen kulttuuriin. Alku ''wu'' viittaa itämaisten taistelulajien taitoihin ja loppu ''xia'' merkitsee henkisiä arvoja. 

Wuxia tarkoittaa siis kiinalaisia sotasankaritarinoita.<ref name="hesari">Jussi Alroth: Jadesoturi vei Kalevalan Kiinaan. Helsingin Sanomat 6.10.2006.</ref> Wuxia-tarinoiden sankari on yleensä mies, joka seikkailee fantasiamaisessa muinasessa Kiinassa. Sankarilla on yli-inhimillisiä ja jopa yliluonnollisia taitoja ja kykyjä, kuten loistavat lähitaistelutaidot, uskomaton ketteryys ja kyky uhmata painovoimaa. Sankari joutuu selvittämään rikoksia ja vääryyksiä. Yleensä sankari itse on kokenut lapsuudessaan traagisia tapahtumia, esimerkiksi menettänyt perheensä. 

Wuxia-kirjallisuus on hyvin suosittua Kiinassa, televisiosarjoja. Elokuvia alettiin tehdä Hongkongissa 1960-luvulla vanhojen tarinoiden pohjalta, mutta elokuvien tyyli sai vaikutteita western-elokuvista.<ref name="hesari" /> Kaikkein ensimmäisenä wuxia-elokuvana kuitenkin pidetään ''The Burning of Red Lotus Monastery'' -nimistä elokuvaa vuodelta 1928.<ref>http://www.heroic-cinema.com/eric/xia.html</ref>

Wuxia-elokuvat olivat länsimaissa pysyneet pitkään melko tuntemattomina, kunnes elokuvaohjaaja Ang Leen ohjaama wuxia-elokuva ''Hiipivä tiikeri, piilotettu lohikäärme'' ilmestyi kesällä 2000. Elokuva menestyi hyvin ja voitti neljä Oscar-palkintoa, kuten vuoden parhaimman ulkomaalaisen elokuvan palkinnon. Ang Leetä seurasi elokuvaohjaaja Zhang Yimou elokuvillaan ''Hero'' ja ''Lentävien tikarien talo'', jotka myös menestyivät hyvin. 

Ang Lee ja Zhang Yimou ovat elokuvissaan muuttaneet wuxiaa siten, että sankari voi olla myös komedioiden ja parodioiden aiheena.

'''Wuxia''' or '''''Wǔxiá''''' (, Mandarin , Cantonese Pinyin: mou5 hap6), literally meaning "martial (arts) heroes", is a distinct quasi-martial arts genre in literature, television and cinema. ''Wǔxiá'' has figured prominently in the popular culture of Chinese-speaking areas since ancient times to the present, and the most important writers have devoted followings.

The ''wǔxiá'' genre is a blend of the philosophy of ''xiá'' (俠, "honor code", "an ethical person", "knight-errant"), and China's long history in ''wǔshù'' ("kung fu" or "martial arts").  A male martial artist who follows the code of ''xiá'' is called a swordsman, or ''xiákè'' (俠客/侠客). bushidō'' traditions, America's Western traditions all share some aspects with China's swordsman ''xiá'' traditions. The swordsmen in ''wǔxiá'' need not serve a lord or hold any military power and they are not required to be from an aristocratic class, although some are.

==History==
===Earlier precedents===
''Wǔxiá'' stories have their roots in some early ''yóuxiá'' (游侠, "Chinese knight-errant") and ''cìkè'' (刺客, "assassin") stories around 2nd to 3rd century BC, such as the assassination attempts of Jing Ke (荊軻/荆轲) and Zhuan Zhu (專諸/专诸) listed in Sima Qian's ''Records of the Grand Historian''.  In the section entitled "Assassins" (刺客列傳/刺客列传), Sima Qian outlined a number of famed assassins in the Warring States who were entrusted with the (then considered noble) task of political assassination.  These were usually ''cì kè'' (刺客, literally "stabbing guests") who resided in the residences of feudal lords and noblemen, rendering services and loyalties much in the manner of Japanese samurai. In another section, "Roaming Xia" (游俠列傳/游侠列传), he detailed many embryonic features of the xia culture of his day.  This popular phenomenon continues to be documented in historical annals like ''The Book of Han'' (漢書/汉书) and ''The Book of Later Han'' (後漢書/后汉书).

''Xiákè'' stories made a strong comeback in the The Kunlun Slave'' (崑崙奴/昆仑奴), ''Jing Shi San Niang'' (荆十三娘), ''Red String'' (紅線/红线) and ''The Bearded Warrior'' (虬髯客) served as prototypes for modern ''wǔxiá'' stories, featuring fantastic, out-of-the-world protagonists, often loners, who performed daring heroic deeds.

The earliest full-length novel that could be considered part of the genre was ''Water Margin'', written in the Ming Dynasty, although some would classify parts of ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' as a possible earlier antecedent.  The former was a political criticism of the deplorable socio-economical state of the late Northern Song Dynasty, whilst the latter was an alternative historical retelling of the post-Han Dynasty's state of three kingdoms.  ''Water Margin'''s championing of outlaws with a code of honor was especially influential in the development of Jianghu culture. ''Three Kingdoms'' contained many classic close combat descriptions which were later borrowed by ''wǔxiá'' writers.

Many works in this vein during the Ming and Qing dynasties were lost due to prohibition by the government.  The ethos of personal freedom and conflict-readiness of these novels were seen as seditious even in times of peace and stability.  The departure from mainstream literature also meant that patronage of this genre was limited to the masses and not to the literati, and stifled some of its growth.  Nonetheless, the genre continued to be enormously popular, with certain full-length novels such as ''The Strange Case of Shi Gong'' (施公案奇聞/施公案奇闻) and ''The Romance of the Heroic Daughters and Sons'' (兒女英雄傳/儿女英雄传) cited as the clearest nascent ''wǔxiá'' novels.  Justice Bao stories seen in ''San Xia Wu Yi'' (三俠五義/三侠五义, which was later extended and renamed Qi Xia Wu Yi 七俠五義) and ''Xiao Wu Yi'' (小五義/小五义) incorporated much of social justice themes of later ''wǔxiá'' stories.

===20th century===

The modern ''wǔxiá'' novel genre started in the early 20th century. The early 20th century and the 1960s to 1980s are often regarded as two golden ages of ''wǔxiá'' writing.

''Wǔxiá'' fiction was banned by the Chinese Communist Party when they came to power in the People's Republic of China. (The ban was lifted in the 1980s, with China's liberalization.) As a result ''wǔxiá'' writing continued in earnest only in 1960s in Taiwan and especially Hong Kong, headed by pioneers Liang Yusheng and Louis Cha, who founded the 'new school'. Writing serially for papers and magazines, they incorporated many fictional techniques from the West.  Although Cha declared the genre effectively dead in the 1990s, its fiction is facing a resurgence, as seen in the sci-fi ''wǔxiá'' novels of Huang Yi and countless amateur Internet writers.

==Theme, plot and settings==

The modern ''wǔxiá'' stories are basically adventure stories set in ancient China. Plot differs largely from writer to writer, but there are very clear similarities with ''wǔxiá'' protagonists and those of the modern Western fantasy genre. The fantasy element is not a prerequisite; it is possible for ''wǔxiá'' fiction to be largely realistic, such as Louis Cha's ''Swordswoman Riding West on White Horse'' or ''The Book and the Sword''.  But as the genre requires, some, perhaps most, of its characters should know martial arts.

A common plot typically features a young male protagonist in ancient China, who experiences a tragedy (e.g. the loss of a family or an old master) and goes through exceeding hardship and arduous trials to learn. Eventually the protagonist emerges as a supreme martial arts master unequalled in all of China, who then proffers his skills chivalrously to mend the ills of the "Jianghu" world. 

Another common thread would involve a mature, extremely skillful hero with an equally powerful nemesis with whom he has had misgivings, and the storyline would meander to a final showdown between the protagonist and his nemesis. 

Other novels, especially those by Gu Long, create detective-type and romance stories in the setting of ancient China.

===The Code of Xia===

To understand the concept of xia from a Western perspective, consider the martial arts skills which he puts to use for the general good rather than towards any personal ends, and someone who does not necessarily obey the authorities. 

Foremost in the xia's code of conduct are yi and xin, righteousness and honour, which emphasize the importance of gracious deed received or favours (恩 ēn) and revenge (仇 chóu) over other ethos of life. Nevertheless, this code of the xia is simple and grave enough for its adherents to fiercely defend.  

The importance of revenge is disputed, since a considerable number of ''wǔxiá'' fiction are influenced by Buddhist idea of pacifism, which stresses forgiveness, compassion and prohibits killing.

===The Use of Wushu===
Although ''wǔxiá'' stories are based on true-life wushu techniques, or martial arts, the genre elevates the mastery of this art to fictitious levels of attainment (''wushu'' being the art; ''wǔxiá'' being the people who practice the art.) Combatants may be portrayed as having any or all of the following skills:

* '''Kung fu.''' Fighting using a codified sequence of movements known as zhāo (招), based on actual Chinese martial arts.

* '''Use of objects''' such as benches, abaci, or sword, staff, and spear weapons are still the most commonly used by combatants.

* '''Use of ''qīnggōng''''' (T: 輕功 S: 轻功), or the ability to move swiftly and lightly, allowing them to scale walls, glide on waters or mount trees. This is based on real Chinese martial art practices. Real life martial art exponents practise qinggong by going through years of attaching heavy weights onto their legs. Its use, however, is greatly exaggerated in wire-fu movies where practitioners appear to circumvent gravity.

* '''Use of ''nèijìn''''' (內勁) or ''nèilì'' (内力), which is the ability to control mystical ''inner energy'' (qi) and direct it for attack, defense, healing, or to attain superhuman stamina. 

* '''Use of ''T: 點穴 S: 点穴) through ''dim mak'' (點脈), chin na (擒拿), or other related techniques for killing, paralyzing, poisoning, or controlling opponents by hitting or seizing their acupressure points (xué 穴) with a finger, knuckle, elbow or weapon.  Real life martial artists train in these seizing and paralyzing techniques. Their effectiveness is greatly exaggerated in ''wǔxiá'' stories.

These skills are usually described as being attainable by those who devote themselves to diligent study and practice. The details of the most powerful skills are often to be found in manuals known as ''Shaolin temple.
