Nasce da una famiglia genovese stabilitasi a Marsiglia. Dopo essere stato mercante e trovatore, divenne monaco dell'ordine di Cîteaux, poi infine vescovo di Tolosa. Tra i grandi trovatori, è il solo che ricopre il ruolo di traditore, a causa della sua adesione alla crociata di Simone IV di Montfort contro gli eretici Albigesi.

È un grande Midi durante la terribile repressione degli Albigesi, il ramo provenzale dei Catari.

In seguito, il suo personaggio con tutto il suo paradosso di grande poeta che ha tradito, a causa di una delusione d'amore per una dama, verrà rievocato nelle poesie d'amor cortese che continuano a comporre i trovatori nel corso del XIII secolo, che segna la fine della cultura del Midi, aventi per tema la follia amorosa e gli accordi e le discordanze tra forma poetica e condotta morale.

'''Folquet de Marselha''', alternatively '''Folquet de Marseille''', '''Foulques de Toulouse''', '''Fulk of Toulouse''' (c. 1150 &ndash; 25 December 1231) came from a Genoese merchant family who lived in Marseille. He is known as a trobadour, and then as a fiercely anti-Cathar bishop of Toulouse.

==Troubadour==

Initially famed as a troubadour, he began composing songs in the 1170s and was known to Richard Coeur de Lion, John of Garlande, later described him as "renowned on account of his spouse, his progeny, and his home," all marks of bourgeois respectability.

==Bishop==

Folquet's life and career abruptly changed around 1195 when he experienced a profound religious conversion and decided to renounce his former life.  He joined the strict Cistercian Order, entering the monastery of Thoronet (Var, France), and appears to have placed his wife and two sons in monastic institutions as well.  He soon rose in prominence and was elected abbot of Thoronet which allowed him to help found the sister house of Géménos to house women, quite possibly including his wife.

He was elected Bishop of Toulouse in 1205, after two Cistercian Papal legates had been sent to the region to reform it.  Pope Innocent III was particularly concerned by the prevalence of both heresy and episcopal corruption in the Languedoc and used the Cistercians to combat both.  The legates had deposed the previous Bishop, Raimon de Rabastens, and were probably instrumental in arranging Folquet's nomination for the position.  

As Bishop of Toulouse, Folquet (now traditionally referred to by his proper name, Foulques, Fulk, or Folc, instead of the diminutive Folquet) took a very active role in combatting heresy.  Throughout his episcopal career he sought to create and encourage outlets for religious enthusiasm that were Catholic in an effort to woo believers away from preachers of heresy (primarily Dominicans property and a portion of the tithes of Toulouse to ensure their continued success. 

==Figure of the Albigensian Crusade==

Bishop Foulques had tumultuous relations with his diocese, primarily on account of his support of the Albigensian Crusade, which was popularly perceived as a war of aggression against the region.
