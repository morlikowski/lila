'''Pokerbegriffe''' sind verschiedene mehr oder auch weniger gebräuchliche, inoffizielle Bezeichnungen für spezielle Spielsituationen, Starthände, Kartenkombinationen und Eigenschaften der Spieler beim Pokerspiel.
Da Poker in den Staaten sehr weit verbreitet ist, stammen auch die meisten Ausdrücke aus der englischen Sprache.

Im Folgenden ist aufgelistet, welche Ausdrücke, die vom Poker bekannt sind, für welche Karte oder Kartenkombination stehen.
Hier werden die englischen Abkürzungen der Kartenbezeichnungen verwendet. ''T'' steht dabei für 10 (engl. ''Ten''), ''J'' für Bube (engl. ''Jack'') und ''Q'' für Dame (engl. ''Queen''). Der Begriff ''offsuit'' oder ''unsuited'' (etwa ''nicht passend'') bedeutet zwei Karten verschiedener Farbe, während der Begriff ''suited'' (etwa ''passend'') zwei Karten gleicher Farbe bedeutet.

The following is a '''glossary of poker terms''' used in Wikipedia poker articles. Some terms link to a more complete article on the topic.

Besides the terms listed here, there are thousands of common and uncommon poker slang terms. Finally, this is not meant to be a formal dictionary; precise usage details and multiple closely related senses are omitted here in favor of concise treatment of the basics. See also card game terminology and the [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Poker Wiktionary] for poker slang terms.

== A ==
; ace-to-five, ace-to-six
: Methods of evaluating low hands. See ace-to-five low, ace-to-six low.
;  act
: To make a play (bet, call, raise, or fold) at the required time. ''It is Ted's turn to act.'' Compare to "in turn".
;  action
# A player's turn to act. ''The action is on you''.
# A willingness to gamble. ''I'll give you action'' or ''There's plenty of action in this game.''
# A bet, along with all the calls of that bet. For example, if one player makes a $5 bet and three other players call, he is said to have $5 "in action", and to have received $15 worth of action on his bet. Usually this term comes into play when figuring side pots when one or more players is all in. See table stakes.
; action button
: A marker similar to a kill button, on which a player places an extra forced bet.  In a scoop pot above a certain size, signifying that in the next pot, that player will be required to post an amount representing a completion of the bring-in to a full bet.  For example, in a stud game with $2 and $4 betting limits and a $1 bring-in, a player with the action button must post $2; after the cards are dealt, the player with the low card must still pay the $1 bring-in, then when the betting reaches the player who posted the $2, he is required to leave it in as a raise of the bring-in (and has the option to raise further).  Players in between the bring-in and the action button can just call the bring-in, but they know ahead of time that they will be raised by the action button.
; action card
: In Texas hold 'em or other community card games, a card appearing on the board that causes significant betting action because it helps two or more players.  For example, an ace on the flop when two players each hold an ace.
; action only
: In many cardrooms, with respect to an all-in bet, only a full (or half) bet can be reraised. Anything less than a full (or half) bet is considered to be ''action only'', that is, other players can call the bet but not raise it. For example, Alice bets $100. Bob calls. Carol goes all in for $119. When the action returns to Alice and Bob, they may only call the extra $19; they cannot raise it. Carol's raise is called ''action only''. Compare to "full bet rule", "half bet rule".
; active player
: A player still involved in the pot.  If there are side pots, an all-in player may be active in some pots, but not in others.
;  add-on
: In a live game, to buy more chips before you have busted. In tournament play, a single rebuy for which all players are eligible regardless of their stack size. This is usually allowed only once, at the end of the rebuy period.  The add-on often offers more chips per dollar invested than the buyin and rebuys.  Compare with "rebuy".
; advertising
: To make an obvious play or expose cards in such a way as to deliberately convey an impression to your opponents about your style of play. For example, to make a bad play or bluff to give the impression that you bluff frequently (hoping opponents will then call your legitimate bets) or to show only good hands to give the impression that you rarely bluff (hoping opponents will then fold when you do).
;  aggressive, aggression
: See loose", "tight", "passive".
; air
# In lowball, "giving air" is letting an opponent who might otherwise fold know that you intend to draw one or more cards to induce him to call.
# Nothing, as in ''That last bluff was with total air'', or ''I caught air on the river''.
;  all in
: Having bet all of your chips in the current hand. See all in.
;  angle
: A technically legal, but borderline unethical, play. For example, deliberately miscalling one's own hand to induce a fold, or placing odd amounts of chips in the pot to confuse opponents about whether you mean to call or raise. A player employing such tactics is called an "angle shooter".
; ante
: See ante.
;  ante off
: In tournament play, to force an absent player to continue paying antes, blinds, bring-ins, or other forced bets so that the contest remains fair to the other players. ''Go ahead and take that phone call. We'll ante you off until you get back.''  Also "blind off".

== B ==
;  backdoor
# A draw requiring two or more rounds to fill. For example, catching two consecutive cards in two rounds of straight or flush.
# A hand made other than the hand the player intended to make. ''I started with four hearts hoping for a flush, but I backdoored two more kings and my trips won.''
; back in
: To enter a pot by checking and then calling someone else's open on the first betting round. Usually used in games like Jackpots, meaning to enter without openers.
; back into
: To win a pot with a hand that would have folded to any bet. For example, two players enter a pot of flushes. Both miss, and check after the draw. The player with the ace-high draw "backs into" winning the pot against the player with only a king-high draw. Also to make a backdoor draw, for example, a player who starts a hand with three of a kind, but makes a runner-runner flush, can be said to back into the flush.
;  backraise
: A reraise from a player that previously limped in the same betting round. ''I decided to backraise with my pocket eights to isolate the all-in player.''  Also limp-reraise.
; bad beat
: See bad beat.
; bank
: Also called the house, the person responsible for distributing chips, keeping track of the buy-ins, and paying winners at the end of the game.
; bankroll
: The amount of money that a player has to wager for the duration of his or her poker career.
: A very chip or money rich player.
; behind
# Not (currently) having the best hand. ''I'm pretty sure my pair of jacks was behind Lou's kings, but I had other outs, so I kept playing.''
# Describing money in play but not visible as chips in front of a player. For example, a player may announce "I've got $100 behind" while handing money to a casino employee, meaning that he intends those chips to be in play as soon as they are brought to him.
;  bet
# Any money wagered during the play of a hand.
# More specifically, the opening bet of a betting round.
# In a fixed limit game, the standard betting amount. ''There were six bets in the pot when I called.''
; betting structure
: The complete set of rules regarding forced bets, limits, raise caps, and such for a particular game. See betting (poker).
; big bet
: See big bet.
; big bet game
: A game played with a no limit or pot limit betting structure.
; big blind
: See blind (poker).
;  blank
: A card, frequently a rag", "brick", "bomb".
; blaze
: A Non-standard poker hand of five flush.
;  blind
# A type of forced bet. See blind (poker).
# In the "dark".
; blind stud
: A stud poker game in which all cards are dealt face down. Was popular in California before legal rulings made traditional stud legal there.
;  blind off, blinded
# To "ante off".
# To have one's stack reduced by paying ever increasing blinds in tournaments. ''Ted had to make a move soon or he would be blinded away in three more rounds.''
;  blocker
: In outs, typically when the board threatens a straight or straight draw.  ''The board was A23 but with my pair of fives I held two blockers to the straight.''  Compare to "dry ace".
;  bluff
: See bluff (poker).
;  board
# The set of community card game. ''If another spade hits the board, I'll have to fold.''
# The set of face-up cards of a particular player in a stud game. ''Zack's board didn't look too scary, so I bet into him again.''
# The set of all face-up cards in a stud game. ''I started with a flush draw, but there were already four other diamonds showing on the board, so I folded.''
;  both ways
: Both halves of a split pot, often declared by a player who thinks he or she will win both low and high.
;  bottom end
: The lowest of several possible straights, especially in a community card game.  For example, in idiot end".
; bottom pair, bottom set
: In a community card game, a pair (or set) made by matching the lowest-ranking board card with one (or two) in one's private hand. Compare second pair, top pair.
; box
: The chip tray in front of a house dealer, and by extension, the house dealer's position at the table. ''You've been in the box for an hour now; don't you get a break?''
;  boxed card
: A card encountered face-up in the assembled deck during the deal, as opposed to one overturned in the act of dealing. Most house rules treat a boxed card as if it didn't exist; that is, it is placed aside and not used. Different rules cover cards exposed during the deal.
; break
# In a straight, and a lowball player may break his 9-high 9-5-4-2-A to draw for the wheel. In a Jacks-or-better draw game, a player breaking a high pair must keep the discarded card aside, to prove he had openers.
# To end a session of play. ''The game broke at about 3:00''.
# During a tournament, an interval where play ceases and the players are free to refresh or relieve themselves.
;  brick
: A "blank", though more often used in the derogatory sense of a card that is undesirable rather than merely inconsequential, such as a card of high rank or one that makes a pair in a low-hand game. Also known as a bomb. Compare to "rags".
;  brick & mortar
: A ''brick & mortar'' or ''B&M'' casino is a term referring to a "real" casino based in a building, as opposed to an online casino.  This term is used to refer to many real world locations vs. their Internet counterparts.  It is not just a poker term or even a gambling term; it is often used in e-commerce in similar situations.
; bridge order
: Poker is neutral about suits.  A spade flush and a club flush with all ranks matching is a tie.  But in determining the dealer at the start of a game, or in determining the bringin bettor in a stud game, bridge rank rules:  Spades beat hearts beat diamonds beat clubs.  It's convenient but coincidental that this works out to reverse alphabetical order.
