En '''välfärdsstat''' är en stat som med skattemedel förser sina medborgare med vissa sociala tjänster som utbildning, sjukvård eller föräldraförsäkring. Man brukar skilja på den generella välfärdsstaten och den selektiva. Den generella välfärdsstaten erbjuder sina tjänster till alla medborgare, medan den selektiva riktar sig till dem som bäst behöver. De mest utvecklade välfärdsstaterna i världen är bland annat de nordiska, men även övriga industriländer har välutvecklade välfärdsstater.

Motsatsen till välfärdsstaten kan sägas vara den nyliberala Bismarcks regeringstid.

En indikator hos en välfärdsstat är där det fattiga folket stödjer högre skatter, i och med att större delen av skattemedlen används till offentliga ändamål och socialt stöd. Redan i antikens Rom fanns höger- och vänsterpolitiker, varav de senare krävde sänkta skatter eftersom skatterna endast användes till de mest essentiella ändamålen infrastruktur, akvedukter och försvar. I en välfärdsstat "tjänar" de lägsta klasserna på höjda skatter eftersom de får tillbaka mer än de ger, det vill säga samhällets resurser används på ett sätt som gagnar de fattiga.

:''This article refers to the general concept of the Welfare state. For the Welfare state of the United Kingdom, please see Welfare State.''

There are three main interpretations of the idea of a '''welfare state''': 
* the provision of welfare services by the state. 
* an ideal model in which the state assumes primary responsibility for the welfare of its citizens. This responsibility in theory ought to be comprehensive, because all aspects of welfare are considered and universally applied to citizens as a right. 'Welfare state' can also mean the creation of a "safety net" of minimum standards of varying forms of welfare. Here is found some confusion between a "welfare state" and a "welfare society" (see below) in common debate about the definition of the term. 
* the provision of welfare in society. In many "welfare states", especially in continental Europe, welfare is not actually provided by the state, but by a combination of independent, voluntary, mutualist and government services. The functional provider of benefits and services may be a central or charity or another form of non-profit organisation.  However, this phenomenon has been more appropriately termed a "welfare society," and the term "welfare system" has been used to describe the range of welfare state and welfare society mixes that are found.<ref name="gould1993"></ref>

==Etymology==
The English term "welfare state" is believed by William Temple during the Second World War, contrasting wartime Britain with the "warfare state" of Nazi Germany.<ref></ref> Friedrich Hayek contends that the term derived from the older German word ''Wohlfahrtsstaat'', which itself was used by nineteenth century historians to describe a variant of the ideal of ''Polizeistaat'' ("police state"). It was fully developed by the German academic ''Sozialpolitiker''&mdash;"socialists of the chair"&mdash;from 1870 and first implemented through Bismarck's "state socialism".<ref>F. A. Hayek, ''The Constitution of Liberty'' (London: Routledge, 1960), p. 502, n. 12.</ref> Bismarck's policies have also been seen as the creation of a welfare state.<ref>S. B. Fay, 'Bismarck's Welfare State', ''Current History'', Vol. XVIII (January 1950), pp. 1-7.</ref>

In German, a roughly equivalent term (''Sozialstaat'', "social state") had been in use since 1870. There had been earlier attempts to use the same phrase in English, for example in Munroe Smith's text "Four German Jurists",<ref></ref> but the term did not enter common use until William Temple popularized it. The Italian term "Social state" (''Stato sociale'') has the same origin.

The Swedish welfare state is called Folkhemmet and 
goes back to the 1936 compromise between the Union and big
Corporate companies. It is a Mixed economy, built on strong
unions and a strong system of Social security and universal health care.  

In French, the synonymous term "providence state" ''(État-providence)'' was originally coined as a sarcastic pejorative remark used by opponents of welfare state policies during the Second Empire (1854-1870).

In Spanish and many other languages, an analogous term is used: ''estado del bienestar''; translated literally: "state of well-being".

In Portuguese, a similar phrase exists: ''Estado de Bem-Estar-Social''; which means "well-being-social state".

== The development of welfare states ==
An early version of the welfare state appeared in China during the Song Dynasty in the 11th century. Prime Minister Wang Anshi believed that the state was responsible for providing its citizens the essentials for a decent living standard. Accordingly, under his direction the state initiated agricultural loans to relieve the farming peasants. He appointed boards to regulate wages and plan pensions for the aged and unemployed. These reforms were known as the "new laws," New Policies, or ''xin fa'' (新法).

Modern welfare states developed through a gradual process beginning in the late 19th century and continuing through the 20th. They differed from previous schemes of poverty relief due to their relatively universal coverage. The development of Bismarck was particularly influential. Some schemes, like those in T.H. Marshall identified the welfare state as a distinctive combination of welfare and capitalism. 

Examples of early welfare states in the modern world are Germany, all of the Nordic Countries, the Netherlands, Uruguay and New Zealand in the 1930s. Germany is generally held to be the first social welfare state. Changed attitudes in reaction to the Great Depression were instrumental in the move to the welfare state in many countries, a harbinger of new times where "cradle-to-grave" services became a reality after the poverty of the Depression. During the Great Depression, it was seen as an alternative "middle way" between communism and capitalism.<ref>"welfare state." O'Hara, Phillip Anthony (editor). Encyclopedia of political economy. Routledge 1999. p. 1245</ref> In the period following the Second World War, many countries in Europe moved from partial or selective provision of social services to relatively comprehensive coverage of the population.

The activities of present-day welfare states extend to the provision of both cash welfare benefits (such as old-age pensions or unemployment benefits) and in-kind welfare services (such as health or childcare services). Through these provisions, welfare states can affect the distribution of wellbeing and personal autonomy among their citizens, as well as influencing how their citizens consume and how they spend their time.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

However, the services are strictly for citizens and these countries do not accept immigrants; those born in these countries do not qualify for citizenship unless they are of the parentage belonging to their respective countries.

In the United Kingdom, the beginning of the modern welfare state was in 1911 when David Lloyd George suggested everyone in work should pay national insurance contribution for unemployment and health benefits from work.

In 1942, the 'Social Insurance and Allied Services' was created by Sir William Beveridge in order to aid those who were in need of help, or in poverty. Beveridge worked as a volunteer for the poor, and set up national insurance. He stated that 'All people of working age should pay a weekly national insurance contribution. In return, benefits would be paid to people who were sick, unemployed, retired or widowed.' The basic assumptions of the report were the National Health Service, which provided free health care to the UK. The Universal Child Benefit was a scheme to give benefits to parents, encouraging people to have children by enabling them to feed and support a family. This was particularly beneficial after the second world war when the population of the United Kingdom declined. Universal Child Benefit provided encouragement for new babies, which sparked the Baby boom. The impact of the report was huge and 600,000 copies were made. 
He recommended to the government that they should find ways of tackling the five giants, being Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness. He argued to cure these problems, the government should provide adequate income to people, adequate health care, adequate education, adequate housing and adequate employment. 
Before 1939, health care had to be paid for, this was done through a vast network of friendly societies, trade unions and other insurance companies which counted the vast majority of the UK working population as members. These friendly societies provided insurance for sickness, unemployment and invalidity, therefore providing people with an income when they were unable to work. But because of the 1942 Beveridge Report, in 5th July 1948, the National Insurance Act, National Assistance Act and National Health Service Act came into force, thus this is the day that the modern UK welfare state was founded.

==Effects on poverty==
Empirical evidence suggests that taxes and transfer considerably reduce poverty in all developed countries, whose welfare states commonly constitute at least a fifth of GDP.<ref name="Kenworthy">Kenworthy, L.

==Debating the welfare state==

The concept of the welfare city remains controversial, and there is continuing debate over governments' responsibility for their citizens' welfare. Here, it is crucial to clarify what exactly one means by welfare state. A welfare state is not a state run economy. The welfare state refers to government provision of certain public services (such as health care, education or social security) to all citizens irrespective of their personal wealth. It also refers to government provision of money or other financial assistance - often temporary or conditional - to those legally unable to provide to themselves because of health problems, unemployment, mental diseases, or a major natural disaster or terrorist attack.

'''Arguments in favor'''
* ''' humanitarian ''' - the right to the basic necessities of life is a fundamental human right, and people should not be allowed to suffer unnecessarily through lack of provision.
* ''' altruism ''' - helping others is a moral obligation in most cultures; charity and support for people who cannot help themselves are also widely thought to be moral choices.
* ''' utilitarian ''' - the same amount of money will produce greater happiness in the hands of a less well-off person than if given to a well-off person; thus, redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor will increase the total happiness in society.
*''' religious ''' - major world religions emphasize the importance of social organization rather than personal development alone. Religious obligations include the duty of charity and the obligation for solidarity. Many religious people feel that a welfare state reflects such values and creates a just society.
* ''' economic ''' - social programs perform a range of economic functions, including e.g. the regulation of demand and structuring the labour market.
* ''' pragmatic ''' - the provision of 'free' healthcare and education produces a healthier, more skilled labour force than would otherwise be the case. This results in a greater benefit in terms of increased productivity than the cost in increased taxes.
* ''' social ''' - social programs are used to promote objectives regarding work. 
* ''' monopolies, oligopolies, or asymmetric information.
* ''' social justice ''' - the money the state provides comes from the nation's labor and natural resources through universal taxation, the rich manages the wealth that is often inherited, and do not necessarily contribute more than the average worker, therefore it is a matter of justice to provide for the private individual who cannot legally provide to himself.  Further, there will also be members of societies who through disability, health  problems, or other causes out of the individual's control, are unable to provide for themselves.  
* ''' economies of scale ''' - some services can be more efficiently paid for when bought "in bulk" by the government for the public, rather than purchased by individual consumers.  The highway system, water distribution, the fire department, universal health , and national defense might be some examples. 
'''Arguments against'''
* '''moral (compulsion) ''' – subsidize the consumption of others. They argue that social spending reduces the right of individuals to transfer some of their wealth to others, and is tantamount to a seizure of private property. 
* '''Protestant Christians believe that only voluntary giving (through private charities) is virtuous. They hold personal responsibility to be a virtue, and they believe that a welfare state diminishes the capacity of individuals to develop this virtue.
* '''anti-regulatory''' - the welfare state is accused of imposing greater burdens on private businesses, of potentially slowing growth and creating unemployment. 
* '''efficiency''' - the free market would provide more efficient and effective production and service delivery than state-run welfare programs. Social spending is costly and must be funded out of higher levels of taxation.
* '''motivation and incentives''' - the welfare state may have undesirable effects on behavior, fostering dependency, destroying incentives and sapping motivation to work.<ref>''The Welfare State We're in'' / James Bartholomew (2004) ISBN 1842750631</ref>
* '''charitable''' - by the state assuming a larger burden for the financial care of people, individuals may feel it is no longer necessary for them to donate to charities or give to philanthropies.
* managerial statecraft - this paleoconservative view posits that the welfare state is part of an ongoing regime that remains in power, regardless of what political party holds a majority.  It acts in the name of abstract goals, such as equality or positive rights, and uses its claim of moral superiority, power of taxation and wealth redistribution to keep itself in power.
* ''' Crime ''' - state provided welfare normally incurs high tax economy, this in turn leads to people feeling protective over their earnings and therefore looking for ways to cheat the tax system to pay less tax. It is also argued that people dependent on welfare may have lower self esteem than working people, which can lead to them feeling rejected, hopeless and/or abandoned by the populace at large, which can in turn lead to crime.
* ''' abuse ''' - it is argued that state provided welfare benefits often finish by being fraudulently claimed by those who are not in real need. To counter this effect, more and more requirements are introduced for welfare claimants to prove their eligibility to obtain benefits. Thus results in creating complex and costly bureaucratic procedures whose effect is often adverse to the desired - the poor and needy persons who are not able to do the required paperwork are left behind while others get specialized in overcoming the bureaucratic hurdles (often by fraud or bribery) and claiming the benefits.
