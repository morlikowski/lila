'''Genetika''' ( = gimdyti) – biologijos mokslo šaka, tirianti genus, paveldimumo dėsnius, kintamumą. Terminą „genetika“ paveldimumo tyrimams apibūdinti pirmą kartą pasiūlė anglų mokslininkas ''William Bateson'' (1905 m. balandžio 18 d.) laiške, rašytame Adam'ui Sedgewick'ui.

Genų nulemtas asmenybes bei pirštų antspaudus.

Pastaruoju metu populiarėja '''genomika''', nagrinėjanti daugelio genų tarpusavio (''genas-genas'') sąveikų bei sąveikų su (''genas-aplinka'') sistemas.

== Istorija ==
Genetikos pradininku laikomas austrų vienuolis, žirnių charakteristikų paveldimumo dėsningumus ir parodęs, kad jie gali būti aprašyti matematinės statistikos principais. Mokslininkas nustatė kaip paveldėjimo požymiai yra perduodami iš kartos į kartą. Brno mieste dabar galima rasti G. Mendelio biblioteką ir [http://www.mendel-museum.org muziejų].

To meto mokslininkai Mendelio darbų nesuprato ir neįvertino iki pat XX a. pradžios (didele dalimi todėl, kad ši informacija buvo paskelbta provincijoje ir nepasiekė to meto mokslo centrų), kai jau po G. Mendelio mirties jo atrasti dėsningumai buvo „peratrasti“ iš naujo.

Lygiagrečiai Mendelio darbams, beveik tuo pat metu (evoliucijos teoriją.

klasikinės genetikos era ir buvo padėti molekulinės genetikos pamatai. J. Watson'as ir F. Crick'as, pasinaudodami R. Franklin kristalografiniais DNR analizės duomenimis, ''Nature'' žurnale pirmąkart aprašė dvigrandinės DNR spiralės struktūrą (1963 m. jiems buvo suteikta Nobelio premija).

==Genetikos tyrimo sritys==
=== Klasikinė genetika ===
Klasikinė genetika apima genetikos metodus, taikytus iki atsirandant molekulinei biologijai. Nors genetikos žinios atsiradus molekulinei biologijai žymiai išsiplėtė, dalis ankstesnių atradimų tebėra naudingi ir galiojantys (pvz., Mendelio dėsniai).

=== Klinikinė genetika ===
Genetikos žinios taikomos diagnozuojant ir gydant genetinių sutrikimų ar sindromų sukeltas ligas. Žr. genetinis konsultavimas.

=== Molekulinė genetika ===
Molekulinė genetika remiasi klasikinės genetikos pagrindais, tačiau labiau domisi genų struktūra ir funkcionavimu molekuliniame (DNR) lygmenyje. Taikomi klasikinės genetikos (kryžminimo) ir molekulinės biologijos metodai. Svarbi molekulinės genetikos sritis yra molekulinės informacijos naudojimas nustatant kilmės modelius ir tuo pačiu teisingą mokslinę organizmų klasifikaciją – tai vadinama molekuline sistematika.

Pagrindinė rutininė technika PGR – polimerazinė grandininė reakcija – pamatinis visų tolimesnių tyrimų etapas, leidžiantis selektyviai pagausinti dominantį DNR fragmentą.

=== Populiacinė genetika ===
Tiriami genetiniai reiškiniai populiacijose. Aiškinami rūšių adaptacijos ir specializacijos mechanizmai.

=== Citogenetika ===
Pagrindinis citogenetikos tyrimo objektas – chromosomos, jų struktūros bei kiekio pokyčiai, stambios delecijos. Tiriama mikroskopuojant, taikant molekulinius fluorochromais žymėtus DNR zondus (FISH (''fluorescence in situ hybridysation'') technika) etc. Taip yra diagnozuojamos chromosominės ligos.

=== Susijusios tyrimų sritys ===
Iš genetikos ir biochemijos disciplinų išaugo molekulinės biologijos mokslas. Genetika glaudžiai siejama su genų inžinerija, kai organizmo DNR yra keičiama siekiant tam tikrų praktinių tikslų.

Pastarųjų metų įvairių organizmų genomų (tame tarpe ir ''Homo sapiens'') sėkmingas sekvenavimas genetiką pavertė tarpdisciplininiu mokslu, kur susisiekia ir glaudžiai persipina molekulinė biologija, bioinformatika, farmakologija, antropologija, sociologija, teismo medicina ir kt. sritys.

</ref> The fact that living things inherit traits from their parents has been used since discrete manner&mdash;these basic units of inheritance are now called genes.
thumb|right|upright|[[DNA, the molecular basis for inheritance. Each strand of DNA is a chain of nucleotides, matching each other in the center to form what look like rungs on a twisted ladder.]]

Genes correspond to regions within creating a new partner strand&mdash;this is the physical method for making copies of genes that can be inherited.

The sequence of nucleotides in a gene is translated by cells to produce a chain of amino acids, creating proteins&mdash;the order of amino acids in a protein corresponds to the order of nucleotides in the gene. This is known as the genetic code. The amino acids in a protein determine how it folds into a three-dimensional shape; this structure is, in turn, responsible for the protein's function. Proteins carry out almost all the functions needed for cells to live. A change to the DNA in a gene can change a protein's amino acids, changing its shape and function: this can have a dramatic effect in the cell and on the organism as a whole.

Although genetics plays a large role in the appearance and behavior of organisms, it is the combination of genetics with what an organism experiences that determines the ultimate outcome. For example, while genes play a role in determining a person's height, the nutrition and health that person experiences in childhood also have a large effect.

==History==

right|thumb|Morgan's observation of sex-linked inheritance of a mutation causing white eyes in ''[[Drosophila'' led him to the hypothesis that genes are located upon chromosomes.]]

Although the science of genetics began with the applied and theoretical work of Gregor Mendel in the mid-1800s, other theories of inheritance preceded Mendel. A popular theory during Mendel's time was the concept of blending inheritance: the idea that individuals inherit a smooth blend of traits from their parents. Mendel's work disproved this, showing that traits are composed of combinations of distinct genes rather than a continuous blend. Another theory that had some support at that time was the inheritance of acquired characteristics: the belief that individuals inherit traits strengthened by their parents. This theory (commonly associated with Jean-Baptiste Lamarck) is now known to be wrong&mdash;the experiences of individuals do not affect the genes they pass to their children.<ref>Lamarck, J-B (2008). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from [http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-273180 Encyclopædia Britannica Online] on 2008-03-16.</ref> Other theories included the pangenesis of Charles Darwin (which had both acquired and inherited aspects) and Francis Galton's reformulation of pangenesis as both particulate and inherited.<ref>Peter J. Bowler, ''The Mendelian Revolution: The Emergency of Hereditarian Concepts in Modern Science and Society'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989): chapters 2 and 3.</ref>

===Mendelian and classical genetics===
The modern science of genetics traces its roots to Gregor Johann Mendel, a German-Czech Augustinian monk and scientist who studied the nature of inheritance in plants. In his paper "Versuche über Pflanzenhybriden" ("Experiments on Plant Hybridization"), presented in 1865 to the ''Naturforschender Verein'' (Society for Research in Nature) in Brünn, Mendel traced the inheritance patterns of certain traits in pea plants and described them mathematically.<ref name="mendel"> (in English in 1901, J. R. Hortic. Soc. 26: 1–32) [http://www.mendelweb.org/Mendel.html English translation available online]</ref> Although this pattern of inheritance could only be observed for a few traits, Mendel's work suggested that heredity was particulate, not acquired, and that the inheritance patterns of many traits could be explained through simple rules and ratios.

The importance of Mendel's work did not gain wide understanding until the 1890s, after his death, when other scientists working on similar problems re-discovered his research. Adam Sedgwick, a zoologist at Greek word ''genesis'' - ''γένεσις'', "origin" and that from the word ''genno'' - ''γεννώ'', "to give birth", predates the noun and was first used in a biological sense in 1860.)<ref>genetic, ''adj.'', Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd ed. </ref> Bateson popularized the usage of the word ''genetics'' to describe the study of inheritance in his inaugural address to the Third International Conference on Plant Hybridization in London, England, in 1906.<ref name="bateson_genetics">
:Initially titled the "International Conference on Hybridisation and Plant Breeding", Wilks changed the title for publication as a result of Bateson's speech.</ref>

After the rediscovery of Mendel's work, scientists tried to determine which molecules in the cell were responsible for inheritance. In 1910, Thomas Hunt Morgan argued that genes are on chromosomes, based on observations of a sex-linked white eye mutation in fruit flies.<ref></ref> In 1913, his student Alfred Sturtevant used the phenomenon of genetic linkage to show that genes are arranged linearly on the chromosome.<ref> [http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/holdings/s/ahs-13.pdf PDF from Electronic Scholarly Publishing]</ref>

===Molecular genetics===
thumb|[[James D. Watson (''pictured'') and Francis Crick determined the structure of DNA in 1953.]]
Although genes were known to exist on chromosomes, chromosomes are composed of both protein and DNA&mdash;scientists did not know which of these was responsible for inheritance. In 1928, transformation (see Griffith's experiment): dead bacteria could transfer genetic material to "transform" other still-living bacteria. Sixteen years later, in 1944, Oswald Theodore Avery, Colin McLeod and Maclyn McCarty identified the molecule responsible for transformation as DNA.<ref name=Avery_et_al>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33226?dopt=AbstractPlus 35th anniversary reprint available]</ref> The Hershey-Chase experiment in 1952 also showed that DNA (rather than protein) was the genetic material of the viruses that infect bacteria, providing further evidence that DNA was the molecule responsible for inheritance.<ref></ref>

James D. Watson and Francis Crick determined the structure of DNA in 1953, using the X-ray crystallography work of Rosalind Franklin that indicated DNA had a helical structure (i.e., shaped like a corkscrew).<ref></ref><ref name=watsoncrick_1953a></ref> Their double-helix model had two strands of DNA with the nucleotides pointing inward, each matching a complementary nucleotide on the other strand to form what looks like rungs on a twisted ladder.<ref name=watsoncrick_1953b></ref> This structure showed that genetic information exists in the sequence of nucleotides on each strand of DNA. The structure also suggested a simple method for duplication: if the strands are separated, new partner strands can be reconstructed for each based on the sequence of the old strand.

Although the structure of DNA showed how inheritance worked, it was still not known how DNA influenced the behavior of cells. In the following years, scientists tried to understand how DNA controls the process of protein production. It was discovered that the cell uses DNA as a template to create matching messenger RNA (a molecule with nucleotides, very similar to DNA). The nucleotide sequence of a messenger RNA is used to create an amino acid sequence in protein; this translation between nucleotide and amino acid sequences is known as the genetic code.

With this molecular understanding of inheritance, an explosion of research became possible. One important development was chain-termination DNA sequencing in 1977 by Frederick Sanger: this technology allows scientists to read the nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule.<ref name=sanger_et_al></ref>  In 1983, Kary Banks Mullis developed the polymerase chain reaction, providing a quick way to isolate and amplify a specific section of a DNA from a mixture.<ref name=saiki_et_al></ref> Through the pooled efforts of the Human Genome Project and the parallel private effort by Celera Genomics, these and other techniques culminated in the sequencing of the human genome in 2003.<ref name=human_genome_project />

==Features of inheritance==
===Discrete inheritance and Mendel's laws===

right|thumb|A Punnett square depicting a cross between two pea plants heterozygous for purple (B) and white (b) blossoms
At its most fundamental level, inheritance in organisms occurs by means of discrete traits, called genes.<ref>Griffiths et al. (2000), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.199 Chapter 2 (Patterns of Inheritance): Introduction]
</ref> This property was first observed by pea plants.<ref name="mendel" /><ref>Griffiths et al. (2000), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.200 Chapter 2 (Patterns of Inheritance): Mendel's experiments]
</ref> In his experiments studying the trait for flower color, Mendel observed that the flowers of each pea plant were either purple or white - and never an intermediate between the two colors. These different, discrete versions of the same gene are called alleles.

In the case of pea plants, each organism has two alleles of each gene, and the plants inherit one allele from each parent.<ref>Griffiths et al. (2000), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.484 Chapter 3 (Chromosomal Basis of Heredity): Mendelian genetics in eukaryotic life cycles]
</ref> Many organisms, including humans, have this pattern of inheritance. Organisms with two copies of the same allele are called homozygous, while organisms with two different alleles are heterozygous.

The set of alleles for a given organism is called its dominant as its qualities dominate the phenotype of the organism, while the other allele is called recessive as its qualities recede and are not observed. Some alleles do not have complete dominance and instead have incomplete dominance by expressing an intermediate phenotype, or codominance by expressing both alleles at once.<ref>Griffiths et al. (2000), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.630 Chapter 4 (Gene Interaction): Interactions between the alleles of one gene]
</ref>

When a pair of organisms reproduce sexually, their offspring randomly inherit one of the two alleles from each parent. These observations of discrete inheritance and the segregation of alleles are collectively known as Mendel's first law or the Law of Segregation.

===Notation and diagrams===
thumb|240px|Genetic pedigree charts help track the inheritance patterns of traits.
Geneticists use diagrams and symbols to describe inheritance. A gene is represented by a letter (or letters) - the capitalized letter represents the dominant allele and the recessive is represented by lowercase.<ref></ref> Often a "+" symbol is used to mark the usual, non-mutant allele for a gene.

In fertilization and breeding experiments (and especially when discussing Mendel's laws) the parents are referred to as the "P" generation and the offspring as the "F1" (first filial) generation. When the F1 offspring mate with each other, the offspring are called the "F2" (second filial) generation. One of the common diagrams used to predict the result of cross-breeding is the Punnett square.

When studying human genetic diseases, geneticists often use pedigree charts to represent the inheritance of traits.<ref>Griffiths et al. (2000), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.229 Chapter 2 (Patterns of Inheritance): Human Genetics]</ref> These charts map the inheritance of a trait in a family tree.

===Interactions of multiple genes===
thumb|right|Human height is a complex genetic trait. [[Francis Galton's data from 1889 shows the relationship between offspring height as a function of mean parent height. While correlated, remaining variation in offspring heights indicates environment is also an important factor in this trait.]]

Organisms have thousands of genes, and in sexually reproducing organisms assortment of these genes are generally independent of each other. This means that the inheritance of an allele for yellow or green pea color is unrelated to the inheritance of alleles for white or purple flowers. This phenomenon, known as "Mendel's second law" or the "Law of independent assortment", means that the alleles of different genes get shuffled between parents to form offspring with many different combinations. (Some genes do not assort independently, demonstrating genetic linkage, a topic discussed later in this article.)

Often different genes can interact in a way that influences the same trait. In the Blue-eyed Mary (''Omphalodes verna''), for example, there exists a gene with alleles that determine the color of flowers: blue or magenta. Another gene, however, controls whether the flowers have color at all: color or white. When a plant has two copies of this white allele, its flowers are white - regardless of whether the first gene has blue or magenta alleles. This interaction between genes is called epistasis, with the second gene epistatic to the first.<ref>Griffiths et al. (2000), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.644 Chapter 4 (Gene Interaction): Gene interaction and modified dihybrid ratios]</ref>

Many traits are not discrete features (eg. purple or white flowers) but are instead continuous features (eg. human height and skin color). These complex traits are the product of many genes.<ref></ref> The influence of these genes is mediated, to varying degrees, by the environment an organism has experienced. The degree to which an organism's genes contribute to a complex trait is called heritability.<ref>Griffiths et al. (2000), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.4009 Chapter 25 (Quantitative Genetics): Quantifying heritability]</ref> Measurement of the heritability of a trait is relative - in a more variable environment, the environment has a bigger influence on the total variation of the trait. For example, human height is a complex trait with a heritability of 89% in the United States. In Nigeria, however, where people experience a more variable access to good nutrition and health care, height has a heritability of only 62%.<ref> [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11443503?dopt=Abstract Abstract from NCBI]</ref>

==Molecular basis for inheritance==
===DNA and chromosomes===

thumb|right|The [[molecular structure of DNA. Bases pair through the arrangement of hydrogen bonding between the strands.]]

The molecular basis for genes is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA is composed of a chain of nucleotides, of which there are four types: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Genetic information exists in the sequence of these nucleotides, and genes exist as stretches of sequence along the DNA chain.<ref name=Pearson_2006></ref> Viruses are the only exception to this rule - sometimes viruses use the very similar molecule RNA instead of DNA as their genetic material.<ref></ref>

DNA normally exists as a double-stranded molecule, coiled into the shape of a double-helix. Each nucleotide in DNA preferentially pairs with its partner nucleotide on the opposite strand: A pairs with T, and C pairs with G. Thus, in its two-stranded form, each strand effectively contains all necessary information, redundant with its partner strand. This structure of DNA is the physical basis for inheritance: DNA replication duplicates the genetic information by splitting the strands and using each strand as a template for synthesis of a new partner strand.<ref>Griffiths et al. (2000), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.1523 Chapter 8 (The Structure and Replication of DNA): Mechanism of DNA Replication]</ref>

Genes are arranged linearly along long chains of DNA sequence, called eukaryotic organisms (which includes plants and animals) have their DNA arranged in multiple linear chromosomes. These DNA strands are often extremely long; the largest human chromosome, for example, is about 247&nbsp;million base pairs in length.<ref> [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7091/full/nature04727.html free full text available]</ref> The DNA of a chromosome is associated with structural proteins that organize, compact, and control access to the DNA, forming a material called chromatin; in eukaryotes, chromatin is usually composed of nucleosomes, repeating units of DNA wound around a core of histone proteins.<ref>Alberts et al. (2002), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.608 II.4. DNA and chromosomes: Chromosomal DNA and Its Packaging in the Chromatin Fiber]</ref> The full set of hereditary material in an organism (usually the combined DNA sequences of all chromosomes) is called the genome.

While loci of sister chromatids, each allele inherited from a different parent.

thumb|left|[[Walther Flemming's 1882 diagram of eukaryotic cell division. Chromosomes are copied, condensed, and organized. Then, as the cell divides, chromosome copies separate into the daughter cells.]]
An exception exists in the sex chromosomes, specialized chromosomes many animals have evolved that play a role in determining the sex of an organism.<ref>Griffiths et al. (2000), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.222 Chapter 2 (Patterns of Inheritance): Sex chromosomes and sex-linked inheritance ]</ref> In humans and other mammals, the Y chromosome has very few genes and triggers the development of male sexual characteristics, while the X chromosome is similar to the other chromosomes and contains many genes unrelated to sex determination. Females have two copies of the X chromosome, but males have one Y and only one X chromosome - this difference in X chromosome copy numbers leads to the unusual inheritance patterns of sex-linked disorders.

===Reproduction===

When cells divide, their full genome is copied and each daughter cell inherits one copy. This process, called mitosis, is the simplest form of reproduction and is the basis for asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction can also occur in multicellular organisms, producing offspring that inherit their genome from a single parent. Offspring that are genetically identical to their parents are called clones.

Eukaryotic organisms often use sexual reproduction to generate offspring that contain a mixture of genetic material inherited from two different parents. The process of sexual reproduction alternates between forms that contain single copies of the genome (haploid) and double copies (diploid).<ref name=haploid_diploid /> Haploid cells fuse and combine genetic material to create a diploid cell with paired chromosomes. Diploid organisms form haploids by dividing, without replicating their DNA, to create daughter cells that randomly inherit one of each pair of chromosomes. Most animals and many plants are diploid for most of their lifespan, with the haploid form reduced to single cell gametes.

Although they do not use the haploid/diploid method of sexual reproduction, conjugation, transferring a small circular piece of DNA to another bacterium.<ref>Griffiths et al. (2000), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.1304 Chapter 7 (Gene Transfer in Bacteria and Their Viruses): Bacterial conjugation]</ref> Bacteria can also take up raw DNA fragments found in the environment and integrate them into their genome, a phenomenon known as transformation.<ref>Griffiths et al. (2000), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.1343 Chapter 7 (Gene Transfer in Bacteria and Their Viruses): Bacterial transformation]</ref> This processes result in horizontal gene transfer, transmitting fragments of genetic information between organisms that would be otherwise unrelated.

===Recombination and linkage===

thumb|right|[[Thomas Hunt Morgan's 1916 illustration of a double crossover between chromosomes]]

The diploid nature of chromosomes allows for genes on different chromosomes to assort independently during sexual reproduction, recombining to form new combinations of genes. Genes on the same chromosome would theoretically never recombine, however, were it not for the process of chromosomal crossover. During crossover, chromosomes exchange stretches of DNA, effectively shuffling the gene alleles between the chromosomes.<ref>Griffiths et al. (2000), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.929 Chapter 5 (Basic Eukaryotic Chromosome Mapping): Nature of crossing-over]</ref> This process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during meiosis, a series of cell divisions that creates haploid germ cells that later combine with other germ cells to form child organisms.

The probability of chromosomal crossover occurring between two given points on the chromosome is related to the distance between them. For an arbitrarily long distance, the probability of crossover is high enough that the inheritance of the genes is effectively uncorrelated. For genes that are closer together, however, the lower probability of crossover means that the genes demonstrate linkage map that roughly describes the arrangement of the genes along the chromosome.<ref>Griffiths et al. (2000), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.899 Chapter 5 (Basic Eukaryotic Chromosome Mapping): Linkage maps]</ref>
