== Métro et tramways ==
''Wimbledon, New Addington et Beckenham. Tout comme le réseau routier, les lignes sur rail souterainnes ou en surface convergent des banlieues vers le centre de Londres. Étant donné le nombre important de banlieusards qui se rendent au cœeur de la ville, le trajet à travers la ville ou de banlieue à banlieue est complexe et relativement long. L'introduction du Tramlink et des projet des nouvelles liaisons ferroviaires sont censés réduire ce problème.   

=== Métro de Londres ===

Surnommé le ''Tube'', le métro de Londres est le plus ancien système de transport souterrain au monde. La première ligne a été inaugurée en 1863 et plus de 3 millions de personnes (soit presque un milliard par an) utilisent quotidiennement ses 12 lignes aujourd'hui <ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/transport/facts-and-figures.jsp ''Transport - facts and figures''], fréquentation du métro de Londres</ref>. Ces 12 lignes relient principalement les banlieues au centre de Londres et aux principales gares de la ville. 

La partie nord de la ville est mieux desservie que le sud. Ceci résulte de la nature des sols au nord de la Tamise, de la compétition avec les transports sur rail en surface et du fait que Londres à commencé à se développer à partir de la rive nord du fleuve. Le sud de Londres est principalement desservi par un réseau de métro léger en surface.

=== Docklands Light Railway ===

Le ''Docklands Light Railway'' (DLR) est une ligne de métro léger déservant les ''Docklands'', dans l'ouest de Londres. Ce métro léger complète le métro de Londres et propose les même tarifs. De nombreuses stations sont en correspondance avec le ''Tube''. Ce système dessert principalement le nouveau quartier d'affaire de Canary Wharf bien que ce n'était pas son but principal lors de son inauguration en 1987.

Grâce au succès et au développement de Canary Wharf, le réseau a connu de nombreuses extensions et aujourd'hui 5 branches principales relient l'Stratford et aéroport de London City. Des extensions de la lignes sont en travaux, permettant notamment de traverser la Tamise vers Woolwich.

=== Tramway ===

'''Heathrow, and a sea port.

London's internal transport is one of the Underground, local buses, trams and the National Rail services within Greater London, which are administered by the national below'').

==Metro and light rail==

TfL operates two railway systems which are not part of the national railway network. The larger is the east and south-east London. TfL also has the Tramlink system, centred on Croydon with lines to Wimbledon, New Addington and Beckenham. Like the road network, a flaw in London's under- and over-ground railways is that they radiate out to the suburbs from the centre. Whilst obviously necessary given the huge volume of commuters, it means that travelling between parts of London which are not on the same commuter-route can be slow. This problem would be reduced by the introduction of Tramlink (see below) and other proposed railway projects. 

===London Underground===

thumb|right|[[London Underground's Green Park station.]]

Colloquially known as the Tube, London Underground is the oldest  Transport for London<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Underground has 12 lines, most of which connect the suburbs to [[Central London and provide a distribution role around the city centre, particularly from major railway terminals.

The Underground serves London north of the river much more extensively than the south. This is the result of a combination of unfavourable geology, historical competition from surface railways and the historical geography of London which was focused to the north of the Thames. South London is served primarily by surface railways (although it should be noted that the majority of London Underground's route length is actually on the surface rather than in tunnel).

===Docklands Light Railway===

The Docklands Light Railway (DLR) is an automated Docklands area of East London. It complements the Underground, largely sharing its fares system and having a number of interchanges with it. It is focused on the Canary Wharf business district, although this was not its initial objective upon its opening in 1987.

Partly thanks to the success of Canary Wharf, the system has expanded several times and now has five main branches connecting the Stratford and Lewisham south of the river. It also serves London City Airport. A number of further extensions are in the works, including another cross-river link, to Woolwich, and one north to Stratford International, where it will interchange with High Speed 1.

===Trams===

<!-- Deleted image removed: thumb|Kingsway subway -->
The London Passenger Transport Board was formed in 1933, taking over the London County Council trams. It was decided soon after to replace all trams in London by "more modern vehicles." The abandonment programme began in 1935 with trams in South-West, West, North-West, North and East London mostly being replaced by trolleybuses. The replacement programme proceeded swiftly until 1940 when the last "pre-war" conversion occurred, leaving only the "South London" trams and the "Kingsway Routes" 31, 33 and 35, the only tram routes left operating into North London to survive the war. 
Prototype "Kingsway Trolleybus" no. 1379, with exits on both sides of the vehicle, was constructed for feasibility tests through the Subway, but these were unsuccessful as trolleybuses would have had to run on battery power through the subway, headroom restrictions making it impossible to use overhead current collection. In 1946 it was decided to replace all London's remaining trams "as soon as possible", this time by diesel buses. The first Kingsway subway route to be withdrawn was Route 31 on 1 October 1950 with the remaining two routes, 33 and 35, being withdrawn after service on Saturday 5 April 1952, the last public services being 'specials' shortly after midnight on the Sunday. During the early hours of the next morning the remaining vehicles still north of the subway were run through to the depots south of the Thames. The Kingsway tramway subway is the only remaining evidence of the old tram system, an underground route along Kingsway.

==Heavy rail==

London is the focal point of the British railway network, with 14 termini stations providing a combination of commuter, intercity, airport and international services. Most areas of the city not served by the Underground or DLR are served by commuter heavy rail services into one of these termini. These suburban rail services are not part of Transport for London but are owned and operated by a number of private rail firms.

The termini are Blackfriars, Cannon Street, Charing Cross, Euston, Fenchurch Street, King's Cross, Liverpool Street, London Bridge, Moorgate, Marylebone, Paddington, St. Pancras, Victoria and Waterloo.

===Commuter rail===
London is the centre of an extensive radial commuter railway network serving the surrounding metropolitan area. Each terminus is associated with commuter services from a particular segment of this area. The majority of commuters to central London (about 80% of 1.1 million) arrive by either the Underground (400,000 daily) or by surface railway into these termini (860,000 daily).<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/transport/trans_strat.jsp The Mayor's Transport Strategy] - Figure 2.20 and Paragraph 2.76.</ref> 

Although the majority of services serve the termini, there are a few notable exceptions. London Bridge has several through lines to the more central termini at Cannon Street and Charing Cross, and trains to the latter also call at Waterloo East, linked to Waterloo by a footbridge. London Bridge's through platforms are also used by the Blackfriars (another terminus with through platforms), City Thameslink, Farringdon and St Pancras (via dedicated subterranean platforms, replacing King's Cross Thameslink). These services run between the northern and southern suburbs, and between the more distant towns of Brighton on the south coast and Bedford in the north.

In addition to its radial lines, there are also several orbital lines connecting parts of the inner city to each other. The Richmond in the west to Stratford in the east, and the Gospel Oak to Barking line links inner North London to the northeastern suburbs. 

In November 2007, TfL took control of these orbital routes from the DfT and the inner-suburban Euston, manages them under the London Overground brand, with train services run under private contract.

Work is also underway for extensions of the Underground's East London Line, converting it into a heavy rail commuter line and linking its northern end to the North London line, while extending its southern end across south London. These extensions will eventually create a full circle through the inner suburbs, to be run on the London Overground network brand.

Constantly increasing pressure on the commuter rail systems and on the Underground to disperse passengers from the busy terminals has led to the multi-billion pound Paddington in the west with Docklands and services out of Liverpool Street in the east, by constructing twin 16-km tunnels underneath the city centre. New stations would be provided at key city centre locations, linking to the Underground.

The growing overcrowding on commuter rail services has led to new ticket restrictions on leisure travellers using cheaper tickets. Although morning peak restrictions for these travellers have been commonplace for many years, evening peak restrictions are also now coming into place. For example, First Capital Connect no longer allows cheaper tickets to be used on services departing London for destinations to the north outside London in the evening peak (4.30pm - 7.30pm), and holders of cheaper tickets are barred from some express First Great Western services from Paddington in the evening.

London is also linked to Paris and Brussels in mainland Europe by High Speed 1 via the Channel Tunnel. High-speed Eurostar trains connect the UK's high speed network to Europe's. The Eurostar's London terminus is at St. Pancras International after previously residing at Waterloo International. Along the way, it will serve Stratford International (also in London) and two stations in the neighbouring county of Kent, Ashford International (which it currently serves already) and Ebbsfleet International.

===Intercity rail===
Long-distance intercity services do not depart from all termini, but each terminus provides trains to a particular part of the country. The major intercity termini are Paddington (for the west of Waterloo (for the South East/South West of Victoria (for South Coast and Euston (for the West Midlands, St. Pancras (for the King's Cross (for the north east of England, Liverpool Street (for East Anglia). Some intercity services carry significant volumes of commuters between their stops nearest to London and the termini. For example, long-distance commuting has been evident from Swindon to Paddington since the introduction of High Speed Trains.<ref>Nash, 1991, "The case from high speed rail"; ''Investigaciones económicas (segunda época), 15 (2), pp337-354</ref>

===Airport services===
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports are served by dedicated train services, and the latter two are also served by standard commuter services. The train operating companies.

===International services===
International services are provided by St. Pancras to Stratford in East London. This new link, brought into service on Waterloo International, putting Paris 2 hours 15 minutes from London and Brussels 1 hour 51 minutes away.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7093761.stm BBC NEWS | England | London | Eurostar arrives in Paris on time<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Some high-speed commuter services to Kent will also be operated over the new line, which is one of Britain's biggest engineering projects.

==Buses==
thumb|right|The modern [[Alexander Dennis Enviro 400|Enviro 400 double decker bus operating services on route 24]]

London's bus network is extensive, with over 6,800 scheduled services every weekday carrying about six million passengers on over 700 different routes.<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/1548.aspx London Buses], Transport for London. Accessed 10 May 2007.</ref> Catering mainly for local journeys, it carries more passengers than the Underground. In addition to this extensive daytime system, a 100-route night bus service is also operated, providing a 24-hour service.

TfL manages the bus system by tendering out routes to private companies. This means that TfL set the routes, frequencies, fares and even the type of vehicle used, and companies bid to run these services for a fixed price for several years, with incentives and penalties in place to encourage good performance against certain criteria.

Many services are operated with the iconic red double decker buses, virtually all using modern low-floor accessible vehicles rather than the traditional open-platform Routemasters, now limited to two city centre "heritage routes" after a phase out in 2006.

The bus system has been the subject of much investment since TfL's inception in 2000, with consequent improvements in the number of routes (particularly night services), their frequency, reliability and the standard of the vehicles used.

==Roads==
London has a hierarchy of roads ranging from major radial and orbital trunk roads down to minor "side streets". At the top level are motorways and grade-separated dual carriageways, supplemented by non-grade-separated urban dual carriageways, major single carriageway roads, local distributor roads and small local streets.

Most of the streets of central London were laid out before cars were invented and London's road network is often congested. Attempts to tackle this go back at least to the 1740s, when the Kingsway were created. In the 1920s and 1930s a series of new radial roads, such as the Eastern Avenue, were constructed in the new suburban outskirts of London but little was done in the congested central area.

A 1937 report, ''The Highway Development Survey'', by Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Charles Bressey for the Sir Patrick Abercrombie all recommended the construction of many miles of new roads and the improvement of existing routes and junctions but little was done to implement the recommendations. In the 1960s the London Motorway Box which would have involved massive demolition and huge cost to bring motorways into the heart of the city. Resistance from Central Government over the costs and campaigns of objection from local residents caused the cancellation of most of the plans in 1973. By the end of the 20th century policy swung towards a preference for public transport improvements, although the 118 mile (190 km) M25 orbital motorway was constructed between 1973 and 1986 to provide a route for traffic to bypass the London urban area. 

===Major routes===
thumb|right|The busy [[M25 motorway which circles the urban area.]]
Due to the opposition to the Ringway plan and earlier proposals there are few grade-separated routes penetrating to the city centre. Only the western A40, eastern A13 and southeastern A2 are grade separated for most of the way into central London.
