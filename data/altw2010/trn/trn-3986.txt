'''Vanausulised''' (vene keeles ''староверы, старообрядцы'') on 17. sajandil Vene Õigeusu Kirikust eraldunud usuline liikumine. 

==Ajalugu==

Õigeusu kiriku jumalateenistusi viidi kuni liturgiliste reeglite järgi. Kreeka emakirikuga. Teda toetas tsaar Aleksei I. Tsaar ja patriarh kutsusid abiks mitmeid välismaiseid (eeskätt Kreeka) nõuandjaid ning toetusid osalt ka oma isiklikule maitsele. 

'''Reformid kokkuvõtlikult''':

* "Bütsantsliku" kahe sõrmega ristimärgi tegemise asemel "ladinlik" kolmesõrmeline.
* Jeesuse nimi kirjutati kujul ''Иисус'', mitte nagu vanasti ''Исус''.
* Ristimise, laulatuse ja pühakoja õnnistamise ajal käimine vastupäeva, mitte päripäeva.
* Usutunnistuses ''"И в Духа Святаго Господа Истиннаго и Животворящаго"'' jäeti välja sõna ''"Истиннаго"''.
* Kahekordse halleluuja asemel kolmekordne.
* Liturgias seitsme armulaualeiva asemel jäeti viis.
* Viidi sisse mitmehäälne poolamõjuline koorilaul.
* Kaotati katoliiklaste ümberristimine.

Kaugeltki kõik usklikud ja vaimulikud ei pooldanud reforme. Nende meelest oli tegu muistsel pärandil püsiva kristliku autoriteedi hülgamisega, õigeusu ajaloo diskrediteerimisega ja tee vabaks andmisega edasisele moderniseerumisele ja ilmalikustumisele. Nad kartsid võõramaa mõjusid ja  "ladina orjust". Vanausuliste vaatekohast langes kirik Antikristuse rüppe.

1658 toimus kirikukogu, kus tsaar hääletas esimesena kõigi uuenduste poolt. Samal ajal suutsid Nikoni vastased tsaari veenda, et patriarhi vägevus hakkab tsaari oma varjutama. Tsaari suhted Nikoniga jahenesid tugevasti ning viimane pidi ametist lahkuma. 1666-1667 Moskva sinod kiitis taas kõik reformid heaks. Vanade kommete pooldajad pandi kirikuvande alla, neid hakati nimetama raskolnikuteks (''раскол'' – vene keeles lõhe). Vanausuliste seas omakorda hakati seda kirikukogu nimetama röövellikuks (''Разбойный'') või hullumeelseks (''Бешеный''). 

küüditamist, vara konfiskeerimist; hukatute arvu on hinnatud mitmele kümnele tuhandele. Pealöök anti vastupanijate keskusteks kujunenud kloostrite pihta, mida mõnel pool oldi sunnitud sõjaväega piirama. Tühjenenud kloostritesse toodi mujalt uued asukad, kes said ka uue vaimulikkonna alustaladeks.

teoloogilises dispuudis viimase kimbatusse viia. Näis, et Joakim oli peaaegu valmis vana ja uue kombe pooldajaid ühendama. Vanausulised juubeldasid, kuid Joakim reetis Nikita ja viimane hukati. 

Arveteõiendamine kestis Peeter I ajani, mil tagakiusamine vähenes peamiselt seetõttu, et pragmaatiline tsaar nägi vanausulistes eeskätt maksumaksjaid. 

Vanausuliste seas jätkusid oma kirikukogud pagenduses, vähetähtsatel maadel Venemaa piiri taga. Neile tegi muret puuduv vaimulikkond, kes oli suures osas füüsiliselt likvideeritud. Vanausulistel puudus piiskop, kuid ainult piiskopid said uusi vaimulikke ametisse pühitseda. See probleem põhjustas vanausuliste lahknemise kahte peamisse harru. 

Vanausuliste seas püsis suhteliselt laialdane kirjaoskus, sest nende kätte oli jäänud hulk käibelt kõrvaldatud vaimulikku kirjandust. Üritati anda lastele algharidust – nii kloostrites kui kaupmehemajades. 18. sajandi alguseks oli juba tekkinud puudus kirjandusest ning asutati põrandaaluseid trükikodasid, sealhulgas Leedus ja Poolas. 

19. sajandi lõpu ja 20. sajandi alguse Venemaal olid vanausulistest kaupmehed edukad tööstuste rajamisel, selle põhjusena on nähtud nii nende traditsioonilist töökust ja visadust kui toimivat omavahelist sotsiaalset võrgustikku. Paljud edukad vanausulised ettevõtjad (näiteks Mihhail Sirotkin ja Mihhail Brilliantov) toetasid usuelu, püüdsid korraldada paremaid suhteid riigiga, koostasid palvekirju tsaarile. 

Vaimulikku kirjandust kirjutas Uurali piiskop Arseni, kes tegeles ka ulatusliku rahvavalgustusega. Tema algatusel toimusid vanausuliste kongressid ja iga-aastased kirikukogud. Tänu tema initsiatiivile alustas 1905 Venemaal tööd esimene legaalne vanauauliste kirjanduse trükikoda, mis kuulus A. Simakovile. 

16. aprillil 1905 andis tsaar Nikolai II ukaasi usuvabaduse kohta.

1971 tühistas Vene Õigeusu Kirik vanausulistele pandud kirikuvande, kuid nende kogudused on püsinud oma eraldatuses.

==Harud==

Vanausulised jagunesid mitmesse harru. Kõige üldisem jaotus kujunes siis, kui enne kirikulõhet pühitsetud vaimulikud olid kõik surnud. 

Popoovetsid ehk preestritega vanausulised (''popovtsõ'') uskusid, et sakramentide jagamiseks on vajalikud pühitsetud vaimulikud, ning lootsid neid värvata uuekombeliste ridadest. 

Bespopoovetsid ehk preestritud vanausulised (''bespopovtsõ'') keeldusid uues kirikus pühitsetud vaimulikke vastu võtmast ning eelistasid jääda ilma kirikliku hierarhiata. 

Kaks peamist haru jagunevad erinevateks gruppideks, mida otseses tõlkes võiks nimetada koosmeelteks või kooskõladeks (''соглас, согласие'') ja õpetusteks (''толк''). 

=== Preestritega vanausulised ===

28. oktoobril 1846 ühines Ambrosius vanausuliste kirikuga ja nii pandi alus Belokrinitsa hierarhiale. Tsaar Nikolai I nõudis Austria keisrilt Ambrosiuse vaimulikust seisusest välja heitmist ning kloostri sulgemist. Metropoliit kutsuti Viini, kus talle tehti ettepanek Konstantinoopoli kiriku rüppe naasta või pagendusse minna. Ta valis viimase ning saadeti Celje (Cilli) linna Slovakkias, kuhu jäi oma surmani 1863. aastal. Enne seda jõudis ta siiski ametisse seada kolm piiskoppi ning panna aluse  vanausuliste piiskoppide järglusele. 1853. aastaks oli Moskvas loodud peapiiskopkond, mille eesotsas seisis Vladimiri ja kogu Venemaa peapiiskop Antonius. Esimese kahe tööaasta jooksul pühitses ta ametisse 54 vaimulikku. Tema elu lõpuks oli Venemaal 12 piiskopkonda, oli ehitatud pühakodasid ja palvelaid.

Preestritega vanausulistel on kaks täiemõõdulist kiriklikku hierarhiat. 

Vene Õigeusu Vanakombeliste Kirik (''Русская Православная Старообрядческая Церковь'')[http://www.rpsc.ru/version/index.php], tuntud ka kui Belokrinitskaja hierarhia (ka nime all Rogožkoe) – esimene täielik ja püsiv vanausuliste kirikuhierarhia; tekkis 1846 Belaja Krinitsa kloostris metropoliit Ambrosise valitsuse all. Praegu (2005) on eesotsas Moskva ja kogu Venemaa peapiiskop metropoliit Kornilius. Sama hierarhia alla kuulub ka Rumeenia Lipovanide Kirik. 

Vene Vana-Õigeusu Kirik (''Русская Древлеправославная Церковь'')[http://www.r-d-c.narod.ru/glav1.htm], tuntud ka kui Novozõbkovskaja hierarhia ehk peapiiskopkond – sellele pani aluse Belokrinitskaja hierarhiat mitte tunnustanud grupp, nn ''beglopopovtsõ'' (Белокриницкое Беглопоповское Старообрядческое Согласие). 1923 tunnistasid nad oma kirikupeaks endise Saraatovi peapiiskopi, vanausuliste poole üle tulnud Nikola. 1929 liitus veel Sverdlovski piiskop Stefan(us) ning tekkis võimalus hakata pühitsema ametisse oma piiskoppe. Esimene läbinisti vanausuliste piiskop oli Pansofi. Keskus asus Saratovis, siis Moskvas, siis Samaras, alates 1963. aastast Novozõbkovis. Eesotsas on patriarh Aleksander. Kirikusse kuulub u 75 kogudust 700-800 tuhande usklikuga; kirik jaguneb 5 piiskopkonnaks.

In the context of Russian Orthodox church history, the '''Old Believers''' () became separated after 1666–1667 from the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church as a protest against church reforms introduced by Patriarch Nikon. Old Believers continue liturgical practices which the Russian Orthodox Church maintained before the implementation of these reforms.  
Russian-speakers refer to the schism itself as ''raskol'' ('''раскол''' - etymologically indicating a "cleaving-apart").

== Introductory summary of origins==

In 1652, Nikon (1605 – 1681; Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church from 1652 to 1658) introduced a number of ritual and textual innovations with the aim of achieving uniformity between Russian and Greek Orthodox practices. Nikon, having noticed discrepancies between Russian and Greek rites and texts, ordered an adjustment of the Russian rites to align with the Greek ones of his time. According to the Old Believers Nikon acted without adequate consultation with the clergy and without gathering a council. After the implementation of these innovations, the Church anathematized and suppressed the old liturgical rite itself as well as those who were reluctant to pass to the new rite with the support of Moscovite state power. These traditionalists endured a severe persecution in 18-19 c. as ''schismatics'' (raskolniki, russ. раскольники) until the ukaz of the Empress Catherine which introduced a new term "Old Ritualists" (''staroobryadtsy''). At the same time they continued to call themselves simply orthodox Christians.

== The reforms of Patriarch Nikon ==
{|style="float: left;"

|}
By the middle of the 17th century Greek and Russian Church officials, including Greek usages. They reached the conclusion that the Russian Orthodox Church had, as a result of errors of incompetent copyists, developed rites and missal texts of its own that had significantly deviated from the Greek originals. Thus, the Russian Orthodox Church had become dissonant from the other Orthodox churches. Later research was to vindicate the Muscovite service-books as belonging to a different recension from that which was used by the Greeks at the time of Nikon, and the unrevised Muscovite books were actually older and more venerable than the Greek books, which had undergone several revisions over the centuries and ironically, were newer and contained innovations (Kapterev N.F., 1913, 1914; Zenkovskij S.A., 1995, 2006). 

Nikon, supported by Tsar Alexis I (reigned 1645 - 1676), carried out some preliminary liturgical reforms. In 1652, he convened a liturgical books with their Greek counterparts. Monasteries from all over Russia received requests to send examples to Moscow in order to have them subjected to a comparative analysis. Such a task would have taken many years of conscientious research and could hardly have given an unambiguous result, given the complex development of the Russian historigraphic techniques at the time.

The ''locum tenens'' for the Patriarch, Pitirim of Krutitsy, convened a second synod in 1666, which brought Patriarch Michael III of Antioch, Patriarch Paisius of Alexandria and many bishops to Moscow. Some scholars allege that the visiting patriarchs each received both 20,000 rubles in gold and furs for their participation (Zenkovskij S.A., 1995, 2006). This council officially established the reforms and anathematized not only all those opposing the innovations, but the old Russian books and rites themselves as well. As a side-effect of condemning the past of the Russian Orthodox Church and her traditions, the messianic theory depicting Moscow as the Third Rome appeared weaker. Instead of the guardian of Orthodox faith, Russia seemed an accumulation of serious liturgical mistakes.

Nevertheless, both Patriarch and Tsar wished to carry out their reforms, although their endeavours may have had as much or more political motivation as religious; several authors on this subject point out that Tsar Alexis, encouraged by his military success in the war against Poland-Lithuania to liberate West Russian provinces and Ukraine, grew ambitious of becoming the liberator of the Orthodox areas which at that time formed part of the Ottoman Empire. They also mention the role of the Near-East patriarchs, who actively supported the idea of the Russian Tsar becoming the liberator of all Orthodox Christians and who suggested that Patriarch Nikon may become the new Patriarch of Constantinople (Kapterev N.F. 1913, 1914; Zenkovsky S.A., 1995, 2006).    

=== Main alterations introduced by Patriarch Nikon ===
The numerous changes in both texts and rites occupied approximately 400 pages. Old Believers present the following as the most crucial changes:

|}

Notes on other differences appear below. Modern readers may perceive these alterations as trivial, but the faithful of that time saw rituals and dogmas as strongly interconnected: church rituals had from the very beginning represented and symbolised doctrinal truth (see the section on ''Justification of Old Belief'' below). Furthermore, the authorities imposed the reforms in an autocratic fashion, with no consultation of the people who would become subject to them, and the reaction against the so-called Nikonian reforms would have objected as much to the manner of imposition as to the actual alterations. In addition, changes often occurred arbitrarily in the texts. For example, wherever the books read 'Христосъ' [''Christ''], Nikon's assistants substituted 'Сынъ' [meaning ''the Son''], and wherever they read 'Сынъ' they substituted 'Христосъ'. Another example is that wherever the books read 'Церковь' [meaning ''Church''], Nikon substituted 'Храмъ' [meaning ''Temple''] and vice-versa. The perceived arbitrariness of the changes infuriated the faithful, who resented needless change for the sake of change.

== The Schism or "Raskol" ==

Opponents of the ecclasiastical reforms of Nikon emerged among all strata of the people and in relatively large numbers (see Raskol). Even after the deposition of patriarch Nikon (1658), who presented too strong a challenge to the Tsar's authority, a series of church councils officially endorsed Nikon's liturgical reforms. The Old Believers fiercely rejected all innovations, and the most radical amongst them maintained that the official Church had fallen into the hands of the Antichrist. Under the guidance of Archpriest Avvakum Petrov (1620 or 1621 to 1682), who had become the leader of the conservative camp within the Old Believers' movement, the Old Believers publicly denounced and rejected all ecclesiastical reforms. The State church anathematized both the old rites and books and those who wished to stay loyal to them at the synod of 1666. From that moment, the Old Believers officially lacked all civil rights. The State church had the most active Old Believers arrested, and executed several of them (including Archpriest Avvakum) some years later in 1682.

=== After the schism ===
After 1685 a period of persecutions began, including both torture and executions. Many Old Believers fled Russia altogether. However, Old Believers became the dominant denomination in many regions, including Pomorye (Arkhangelsk region), Guslitsy, Kursk region, the Urals, Siberia etc. A compact 40,000-strong Lipovan community of Old Believers still lives in neighboring Kiliia raion (Vilkovo) of Ukraine and Tulcea County of Romania in the Danube Delta. By the 1910s, about 25% of the population in Russia said that they belonged to one of the Old Believer branches (census data).

Government oppression could vary from relatively moderate, as under Nicholas I (reigned 1825 - 1855). The Russian synodal state church and the state authorities often saw Old Believers as dangerous elements and as a threat to the Russian state. 

In 1905 Tsar Nicholas II signed an Act of religious freedom, which ended the persecution of all religious minorities in Russia. The Old Believers gained the right to build churches, to ring church bells, to hold processions and to organize themselves. It became prohibited (as under Catherine the Great (reigned 1762 - 1796)) to refer to Old Believers as ''raskolniki'' (schismatics), a name they consider insulting. People often refer to the period from 1905 until 1917 as "the Golden Age of the Old Faith". One can regard the Act of 1905 as emancipating the Old Believers, who had until then occupied an almost illegal position in Russian society. Nevertheless some restrictions for Old Believers continued: for example, they were forbidden from joining the civil service.

== Modern situation ==
thumb|150px|Old Believer church outside of [[Gervais, Oregon.]]

In 1971 the Moscow Patriarchate revoked the anathemas imposed on the Old Believers in the 17th century. While treating the Old-Ritualist hierarchy and clergy with at least a semblance of courtesy, their attitude seems to be at best ambiguous and to regard even the Edinovertsy with mistrust. Recently, the Moscow Patriarchate attempted to pressure the Russian state to withdraw recognition of Old Belief as a 'Traditional Religion of Russia'.  

In 1974, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia issued an ukase revoking the anathemas and asked forgiveness from the Old Believers for the wrongs done them. Under their auspices, the first efforts to make the prayer and service books of the Old Believers available in English were made. Nevertheless, most Old Believer communities have not returned to Communion with the majority of Orthodox Christianity worldwide.

Estimates place the total number of Old Believers remaining today at from 1 to 10 millions, some living in extremely isolated communities in places to which they fled centuries ago to avoid persecution.  One [http://www.churchofthenativity.net/index.html Old-Believer parish] in the United States has entered into communion with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia.

Old-Believer churches in Russia currently have started restoration of their property, although Old Believers (unlike the nearly-official mainstream Orthodoxy) face many difficulties in claiming their restitution rights for their churches. Moscow has churches for all the most important Old Believer branches: Rogozhskaya Zastava (Popovtsy of the Belokrinitskaya hierarchy official center), a cathedral for the Novozybkovskaya hierarchy in Zamoskvorech'ye and Preobrazhenskaya Zastava where Pomortsy and Fedoseevtsy coexist.

Within the Old-Believer world, only leaders of the congregations.

Nowadays Old Believers live all over the world; they scattered mainly due to persecutions under the Tsars and due to the Russian Revolution of 1917. Significant Old-Believer communities exist in Homer (Anchor Point (Nikolaevsk),[http://www.habitat.adfg.state.ak.us/geninfo/kbrr/coolkbayinfo/kbec_cd/html/human/socioecn/snapshot.htm] and Delta Junction.[http://www.labor.state.ak.us/trends/nov02.pdf] Two flourishing communities also exist in Sydney, Australia.

== Old Believer Denominations ==

Although all Old Believers groups emerged as a result of opposition to the Nikonian reform, they do not constitute a single monolithic body. In fact, the Old Believers feature a great diversity of groups that profess different interpretations of the church tradition and often are not in communion with each other. Some groups even practise re-baptism before admitting a member of another group into their midst. 

The terminology used for the divisions within the Old-Believer denomination does not always make precise delineations. Generally, people may refer to a larger movement or group — especially in the case of such major ones as ''popovtsy'' and ''bespopovtsy'' — as a ''soglasie'' or ''soglas'' (in English: "agreement" or more generally, "confession").  Another term, ''tolk'' (English: "teaching") usually applies to lesser divisions within the major "confessions". In particular it can characterise multiple sects that have appeared within the ''bespopovtsy'' movement.

=== Popovtsy ===
Since none of the bishops joined the Old Believers (except Bishop Pavel of apostolically ordained priests of the old rite would have soon become extinct. Two responses appeared to this dilemma: the ''Popovtsy'' (поповцы, "with priests") and the ''Bespopovtsy'' ("priestless").

The Popovtsy represented the more moderate conservative opposition, those who strove to continue religious and church life as it had existed before the reforms of Nikon. They recognized ordained priests from the new-style Russian Orthodox church who joined the Old Believers and who had denounced the Nikonian reforms. In 1846 they convinced Amvrosii Popovich (1791–1863), a Greek Orthodox bishop whom Turkish pressure had had removed from his see at Sarajevo, to become an Old Believer and to consecrate three Russian Old-Believer priests as bishops. In 1859, the number of Old-Believer bishops in Russia reached ten, and they established their own episcopate, the so called Belokrinitskaya hierarchy. Not all priestist Old Believers recognized this hierarchy. Dissenters known as беглопоповцы (''beglopopovtsy'') obtained their own hierarchy in the 1920s. The priestist Old Believers thus manifest as two churches which share the same beliefs, but which treat each other's hierarchy as illegitimate. Popovtsy have priests, bishops and all sacraments, including the eucharist. 
*Belokrinitskaya hierarchy - The largest Popovtsy denomination. One can refer to the Russian part of this denomination as the Belokrinitskoe Soglasie (the "Belokrinitsky Agreement") or as the Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church.
**Okruzhniki (extinct)
**Neokruzhniki (extinct)
*Novozybkovskaya hierarchy or Russian Old-Orthodox Church
*Beglopopovtsy (extinct, now the Russian Old-Orthodox Church)
*Luzhkane, also known as ''Luzhkovskoe soglasie'' (extinct). In some places, they had no priests and so belonged to Bespopovtsy.

=== Bespopovtsy ===
The Bespopovtsy (the "priestless") rejected "the World" where Antichrist reigned; they preached the imminent end of the world, asceticism, adherence to the old rituals and the old faith. The Bespopovtsy claimed that any priest or Hierarch who has ever used the Nikonian Rites have forfeited Apostolic Succession. Therefore, the true church of Christ had ceased to exist on Earth, and they therefore renounced priests and all sacraments except baptism. The Bespopovtsy movement has many sub-groups. Bespopovtsy have no priests and no eucharist.
*Pomortsy or Danilovtsy (not to be confused with Pomors) originated in North European Russia (Russian Karelia, Arkhangelsk region). Initially they rejected marriage and prayer for the Tsar. 
*Novopomortsy, or "New Pomortsy" - accept marriage
*Staropomortsy, or "Old Pomortsy" - reject marriage
*Fedoseevtsy – “Society of Christian Old Believers of the Old Pomortsy Unmarried Confession” (1690s- present); deny marriage and practise cloister-style asceticism.
*Fillipovtsy.
*Baykal Lake).

====Bespopovsty: Minor Groups====
Aside from these major groups, many smaller groups have emerged and died out at various times since the end of 17th century:
*''Aristovtsy'' (beginning of 19th to the beginning of 20th centuries; extinct) - from the name of the merchant Aristov;
*''Titlovtsy'' (extinct in 20th cent.) - emerged from Pilate's inscription upon the cross (''titlo''), which other groups rejected;
*''Troparion'' confession (troparschiki) - a group that commemorated the tsar in the hymns (troparia);
*Daniel’s confession of the “partially married” (''danilovtsy polubrachnye'');
*Adamant confession (''adamantovy'') - refused to use money and passports (as containing the seal of Antichrist); 
*Aaron's confession (''aaronovtsy'') - second half of the 18th century, a spin-off of the Fillipovtsy.
*“Grandmother’s confession” or the Self-baptized - practised self-baptism or the baptism by midwives (''babushki''), since a valid priesthood — in their opinion — had ceased to exist;
*“Hole-worshippers” (''dyrniki'') - relinquished the use of icons and prayed to the east through a hole in the wall (!);
*Melchisedecs (in Moscow and in Bashkortostan) - practised a peculiar lay "quasi-eucharistic" rite;
*“Runaways” (''beguny'') or “Wanderers” (''stranniki'');
*“Netovtsy” or Saviour’s confession - denied the possibility of celebrating sacraments and praying in churches; the name comes from the Russian ''net'' "no", since they have "no" sacraments, "no" churches, "no" priests etc.

==Edinovertsy==

'''Edinovertsy''' (, i.e. 'people of the same faith'; collective, единоверчество) - Agreed to become a part of the official Russian Orthodox Church while saving the old rites. First appearing in 1800, the Edinovertsy come under the omophor of the Russian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate or of the Russian Church Abroad. A small number of Edinovertsy are in communion with the Roman Catholic Church. Edinoversty retain the use of the pre-Nikonian rituals. They can be regarded as "Old Ritualists", but they do not count as "Old Believers" in the standard sense.

== Differences between the Old Believers and post-Nikonian Russian Orthodoxy ==

thumb|300px|right|6th century icon, depicting Christ giving a blessing. Two fingers appear straightened, three folded. The Old Believers regard this as the proper way of making the sign of the Cross.

* Old Believers use two fingers while making the sign of the cross (two fingers straightened, three folded) while new-style Orthodoxy uses three fingers for the sign of cross (three fingers straightened, two fingers folded). Old Ritualists generally say the Jesus Prayer with the Sign of the Cross, while New Ritualists use the Sign of the Cross as a Trinitarian symbol. This makes for a significant difference between the two branches of Russian Orthodoxy, and one of the most noticeable (see the picture of Boyarynya Feodosia Morozova above).
* Old Believers reject all changes and emendations of liturgical texts and rituals introduced by the reforms of Patriarch Nikon. Thus they continue to use the older Church Slavonic translation of the sacred texts, including the Psalter, striving to preserve intact the "pre-Nikonian" practices of the Russian Church.
* Old Believers only recognize performing baptism through three full immersions, and reject the validity of any baptismal rite performed otherwise (for example through pouring or sprinkling, as the Russian Orthodox Church has  occasionally accepted since the 18th century).
* Old Believers in principle oppose ecumenism, despite many instances of good relationships and collaboration with other Eastern Orthodox churches.

Old Believers and new-style Orthodoxy have a lot of small, but essential, differences in their respective church services. The very style and atmosphere of the services differs:
** Old Believers perform the Liturgy with 7 prosphora, not 5, as in new-style Orthodoxy. 
** Old Believers chant the alleluia verse after the psalmody twice, not three times.
** Old Believers do not use notation, but with special signs — ''kriuki'' or ''znamena'' ("hooks: or "banners" in English translation; see Znamenny Chant). Old Believers practise several different types of  Znamenny Chant: Stolpov Chant, Great Znamenny Chant, Lesser Znamenny Chant, Putevoi Chant, Pomorsky Chant(or Khomov Chant), Demestvenny Chant, etc. 
** Old Believers use only Byzantine iconography; they do not believe in venerating realistic images of Christ, Our Lady and the Saints as icons (which has wide acceptance in new-style Orthodoxy). Old Ritualists do not accept photographic or printed reproductions of icons in their worship. 
** Old Believers do not kneel while praying, but in comparison with new-style Orthodoxy, they perform more bows and prostrations, see Zemnoy poklon). While making prostrations, Old Believers use a special little rug called a ''podruchnik'', placing their hands on it. The fingers used to make the Sign of the Cross must remain clean during the prayers.
** On average the Old Believers' services last two to three times longer than in new-style Orthodoxy. In general, the Old Believers insist on following the rubrics to the letter, and refrain from shortening the the First Hour.
right|thumb|Lestovka
** While saying repetitive prayers, Old Believers use a special type of beads called ''lestovka''.
** Old Believers who have ordained priests use a more strict preparation before Communion — with very strict fasting within the week before Communion. This explains in part why Communion among laity is common only during the Lent and other long fasts.
** It is common after each Confession to have some epitimia (i.e. penance or remedy). Usually, it is a certain number of bows, which are counted with the help of a lestovka.
* Old Believers do not venerate saints that appeared in Orthodoxy after 1666. For example, they do not venerate Saint Seraphim of Sarov, one of the most well-known Russian saints of the 19th century. On the other hand, many Old Believers' ecclesial bodies have canonized a number of saints who are not being recognized by the Russian Orthodox Church, e.g. archpriest Avvakum and others.
* Old Believers use cast (silver, bronze) and carved (wooden) icons as well as painted ones. The new-style Orthodoxy prohibited the veneration of icons in relief.  In Old Believer circles the practice continued and became very popular, since Old Believers had often to hide their religious implements. Cast icons of small size (and often also folding — see skladen) proved very useful in that respect.

That may include prohibitions on sharing meals with people of other faiths, on using their belongings and wares, etc.
