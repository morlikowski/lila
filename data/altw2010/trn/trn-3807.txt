'''Боинг 787''' () — новейший тип пассажирского самолёта популярной серии коммерческих авиалайнеров американской компании Боингом 767. До 28 января 2005 года 787-й был известен только под кодовым названием '''7E7'''.

К концу 1990-х стало очевидно, что Боинг 767 значительно устарел, и не может соревноваться с новыми разработками соперника звуковой, при этом в среднем расходуя не больше топлива (за счёт укороченного времени полёта), чем 767-й или А330. К сожалению, из-за террористических атак 11 сентября и повышающихся цен на нефть стало ясно, что авиакомпании больше заинтересованы в экономичности полётов, чем в скорости, и проект Sonic Cruiser был заброшен.

26 апреля 2004 Боинг представил миру свой новый проект под кодовым именем '''7E7'''<ref>http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2004/q2/nr_040426g.html</ref>. Этот новый проект послужил в качестве замены Sonic Cruiser, унаследовав многие идеи и технологии своего предшественника. 28 января 2005 года Boeing объявил, что 7Е7 будет выпускаться под названием '''Боинг 787'''. 25 апреля 2005 года, то есть год спустя от начала проекта, внешний вид 787-го был «заморожен».

На данный момент, Боинг предлагает три варианта авиалайнера.
* '''787-3''' — 296-местный вариант с дальностью 6 500 км, рассчитанный для загруженных маршрутов малой протяжённости. Этот вариант заменит Боинги 767 и Аэробусы А300 на внутренних рейсах Японии. Боинг получил заказы на этот вариант от ''All Nippon Airways'' и ''Japan Airlines''. Начало поставки — 2010 год. Стоимость — 146 - 151,5 млн $<ref name="prices"/>
* '''787-8''' — базовый вариант, рассчитанный как замена Боингу 767-300ER. Вмещает до 250 пассажиров (в зависимости от конфигурации), дальность — 15 700 км. Начало поставки — 2008 год. Стоимость — 157 - 167 млн $<ref name="prices"/>
* '''787-9''' — Удлинённый вариант, вмещающий до 290 с немного большей дальностью по сравнению 787-8. Рассчитан как замена Боингу 767-400ER, Аэробусам А330-200 и А340-200, McDonnell Douglas MD-11 и Lockheed L-1011. Стоимость — 189 - 200 млн $<ref name="prices"/>

В данный момент Боинг также рассматривает вариант '''787-10''', вмещающий до 350 пассажиров, который теоретически сможет заменить Боинги 777-200A и 777-200ER.

The  '''Boeing 787 ''Dreamliner''''' is a mid-sized, wide-body, twin engine fuel-efficient than earlier Boeing airliners and will be the first major airliner to use composite materials for most of its construction.<ref name="787_flyingredef"></ref>  Boeing's development of the 787 is also innovative in the collaborative management approach with suppliers.

On tail.

Boeing featured its first 787 in a rollout ceremony on Everett assembly factory, by which time it had become the fastest-selling wide body airliner in history with nearly 600 orders.<ref name="fastest_selling">"[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/06/18/eveningnews/main2944798.shtml?source=RSSattr=Business_2944798 Boeing Gets A Wing Up On The Competition]."

==Development==
===Background===
In the late 1990s, Boeing began considering a replacement for the 767 when sales weakened due to the competing Airbus A330-200. As sales of the Sonic Cruiser and the 747X. The Sonic Cruiser would have achieved higher speeds (approximately Mach 0.98) while burning fuel at the same rate as the existing 767 or A330. The 747X, competing with the supercritical wing.

Market interest for the 747X was tepid, but the Sonic Cruiser had brighter prospects. Several major airlines in the United States, including Continental Airlines, initially showed enthusiasm for the Sonic Cruiser concept, although they also expressed concerns about the operating cost.<ref name="Forbes_Sonic_Cruiser_20010528"></ref> By decreasing travel time, they would be able to increase customer satisfaction and aircraft utilization.

The September 11, 2001 attacks upended the global airline market. Airlines could not justify large capital expenditures, and increased petroleum prices made them more interested in efficiency than speed. The worst-affected airlines, those in the United States, were considered the most likely customers of the Sonic Cruiser. Boeing offered airlines the option of using the airframe for either higher speed or increased efficiency, but the high projected airframe costs caused demand to slacken further. Boeing canceled the 747X once Airbus launched production of the Airbus A380, and switched tracks by offering an alternative product, the 7E7.<ref name="787_flyingredef"/>

===Design phase===
The replacement for the Sonic Cruiser project was dubbed the "7E7"<ref>[http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2003/march/cover.html Maximizing the Middle, Finding the sweet spot in the market], Boeing Frontier magazine, March 2003.</ref> (with a development code name of "Y2"). The "E" was said to stand for various things, depending upon the audience. To some, it stood for "efficiency", to others it stood for "environmentally friendly". In the end, Boeing claimed it merely stood for "Eight", after the aircraft was eventually rechristened "787".<ref name="787_flyingredef" /> A public naming competition was also held, for which out of 500,000 votes cast online the winning title was ''Dreamliner''.<ref></ref>

On Denver, Montreal, and Boston. As is common for launch customers, ANA is rumored to have received a discount of 40–50% from list price.

thumb|right|Earlier proposed design configuration of the Boeing 7E7.
Early concept images of the 787 included rakish cockpit windows, a dropped nose and a distinctive "shark-fin" vertical stabilizer. The final styling of the aircraft was more conservative, the fin appearing visually similar to those of aircraft currently in service. The nose and cockpit windows were also changed to a more conventional form.

The 787-3 and 787-8 were to be the initial variants, with the 787-9 entering service in 2010. Boeing initially priced the 787-8 variant at US$120 million, a low figure that surprised the industry. Boeing has since increased the price twice. As of 2007, the list price was $146–151.5 million for the 787-3, $157–167 million for the 787-8 and $189–200 million for the 787-9.<ref name="bca_prices">"[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/prices/ Commercial airplane - jet prices]." Boeing.</ref>  Customer-announced orders and commitments for the 787 reached 237 aircraft during the first year of sales, with firm orders numbering 677 by the 787's premiere on July 8, 2007, and well before entry into service.<ref name="bca_20070403_500">"[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q2/070403d_nr.html Boeing's 787 Dreamliner Surpasses 500 Customer Orders in under Three Years]." Boeing press release. April 3, 2007.</ref> This makes the 787 the fastest-selling wide body airliner ever before entry into service.<ref name="fastest_selling" /><ref name="Mike_Bear_47_Paris_Airshow">''[http://www.boeing.com/news/feature/paris07/assets/071906_bair_pas.pdf 47th International Paris Air Show 2007: 787 Progress Report]''.

thumb|left|The engine pods on the 787 feature chevron edges to reduce noise.
The 787 uses the same technology proposed for the Sonic Cruiser in a more conventional configuration (see Features). Boeing claims the 787 will be at least 20% more fuel-efficient than current competing aircraft. One third of the efficiency gain will come from the engines, another third from aerodynamic improvements and the increased use of lighter weight composite materials, and the final third from advanced systems. The most notable contribution to efficiency is the electric architecture which replaces Yellowstone Project (of which the 787 is the first stage).<ref name="Boe_787_power_on">[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2008/q2/080620b_nr.html "Boeing Achieves 787 Power On"], Boeing, June 20, 2008.</ref>

Boeing selected two pods. However, Pratt & Whitney was at the limit of its development capability, and would be unable to power the 787 . According to A350 powered by a development of the  Trent XWB.

The launch of a new airliner can be expected to draw scathing comments from competitors, Boeing's doubt over the Airbus A380 and Airbus's mocking of the Sonic Cruiser being recent examples. The 787 is no exception, as Airbus's John Leahy attempted to refute all of Boeing's claims. Leahy openly criticized the large-scale use of composites in the 787's fuselage as being "rushed and ridiculous". Despite this criticism, Boeing built and tested the first composite section while examining the Sonic Cruiser concept nearly five years before,<ref name="bca_scfuse_test">"[http://www.boeing.com/news/feature/concept/photok62055.html Boeing Testing Sample Sonic Cruiser Fuselage]."

===Production===

After stiff competition, Boeing announced on 737 program, which involves shipping fuselage barrel sections by rail from Spirit AeroSystems' Wichita, Renton, Washington. As the major components have many components pre-installed before delivery to Everett, final assembly time is reduced to only three days. This is less than a fourth of the time traditionally needed for Boeing's final assembly process.<ref name=What_is_What_Final_Assembly></ref><!-- This source does not seem very authoritative. The web site is run by a college student. --><ref></ref><ref>Boeing's Big Dream, Fortune May 5, 2008 p.187</ref>

In order to speed delivery of the 787's major components, Boeing has modified three 747s purchased from Chinese and Taiwanese airlines. Called Dreamlifters, these widened airplanes can house the wings and fuselage of the 787 as well as other smaller parts.

The passenger doors are made by Latécoère (France), and the cargo doors, access doors, and crew escape door are made by Saab (Sweden). Japanese industrial participation is very important to the project, with a 35% work share, and many of the subcontractors supported and funded by the Japanese government.<ref></ref> On April 26 2006, Japanese manufacturer Toray Industries and Boeing announced a production agreement involving $6 billion worth of carbon fiber.

Connecticut (USA)-based Hamilton Sundstrand provides power distribution and management systems for the aircraft, including manufacture and production of Generator Control Units (GCUs) as well as integration of power transfer systems that can move power from the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and the main engines to the necessary parts and machinery of the aircraft. Cold weather test of the APU took place in Alaska.

The first composite fuselage section rolled out in January 2005, and final external design was set in April 2005. On June 30, 2006, Boeing celebrated the start of major assembly of the first 787 at Fuji Heavy Industries' new factory in Handa, Japan, near Nagoya.<ref name="bca_20060630_assembly">"[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2006/q2/060630a_nr.html Major Assembly of First Boeing 787 Dreamliner Starts]."

On December 6, 2006, Boeing conducted a "virtual rollout" of the 787. Unlike a traditional rollout (which occurred later), it took place without a physical airframe present. Taking computer aided design beyond the aircraft itself, Boeing modeled the manufacturing process, step-by-step and end-to-end, in software. The virtual rollout is intended to discover production issues prior to assembly of the first airframe, when they are cheaper to fix.<ref name="spi_20061207">"[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/294997_787rollout07.html Virtual rollout of the 787]."

===Development problems and delays===

Boeing decided to change its basic assembly approach beginning with the 787. Rather than receive individual parts and assemble them in Everett, Washington, Boeing assigned its subcontractors to do more assembly themselves and deliver completed subsystems to Boeing.  Boeing would then perform final assembly.  The major benefits of this approach are a leaner and simpler assembly line and lower inventory; its success depends to the degree to which suppliers can perform the extra work.  Some subcontractors have had difficulty completing the extra work, because they could not procure the needed parts, perform the subassembly on schedule, or both.  The remaining assembly work is left for Boeing to complete and is referred to as "traveled work".<ref>[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2008/q2/080409b_nr.html "Boeing Revises 787 First Flight and Delivery Plans; Adds Schedule Margin to Reduce Risk of Further Delays"], Boeing, April 9, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2008/q1/080215b_pr.html "Final Assembly Begins on Another Boeing 787 Dreamliner"], Boeing, February 15, 2008</ref><ref>Boeing's Big Dream, Fortune Magazine May 5, 2008, p.182</ref>

Boeing premiered the first 787 at a rollout ceremony on July 8 2007, which matches the aircraft's designation in the US-style month-day-year format (7/08/07).<ref>''[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/news/2007/q3/070708b_nr.html Boeing Celebrates the Premiere of the 787 Dreamliner]'' July 8, 2007.</ref> However, some of the aircraft's major systems had not been installed at that time, and many parts were attached with temporary non-aerospace fasteners requiring their later replacement with flight fasteners.<ref name="Flight Global"></ref>  Boeing had originally planned for a first flight by the end of September 2007,<ref name="AP_787_slip"></ref> but on September 5 announced a three-month delay, blaming a shortage of fasteners as well as incomplete software.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aUs7S1JX0HuI&refer=home Boeing Delays 787's First Flight to November-December] 5 September, 2007</ref>

On October 10, 2007 a second three-month delay to the first flight and a six-month delay to first deliveries was announced. Boeing cited problems with its foreign and domestic supply chain for the delay, especially the ongoing fastener shortage, the lack of documentation from overseas suppliers, and continuing delays with the flight guidance software.<ref name="AP_20071010_delivery_delay"></ref><ref name="ny_times_20071010_delivery_delay"></ref><ref></ref> Less than a week later, the 787 program manager was replaced, although the delivery delays were not cited as a reason for the change.<ref></ref>

On January 16 2008 Boeing announced a third three-month delay to the first flight of the 787, with deliveries to launch customer All Nippon Airways postponed until early 2009. The Company said that insufficient progress had been made completing work that was originally planned to be carried out by suppliers.<ref>[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2008/q1/080116a_nr.html "http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2008/q1/080116a_nr.html"], Boeing, January 16, 2008.</ref>

On March 28, 2008, Boeing announced that it plans to buy Vought Aircraft Industries' interest in Global Aeronautica, owner of the South Carolina plant that manufacturers major portions of the 787's fuselage. The purchase will make the assembly plant a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Italy’s Alenia Aeronautica.<ref>[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/GLOBAL03288.xml&headline=Boeing%20Buys%20Vought%20Share%20Of%20Fuselage%20Builder&channel=comm "Boeing Buys Vought Share Of Fuselage Builder"], Aviation Week, March 28, 2008.</ref>

On April 9, 2008, Boeing officially announced a fourth delay, shifting the maiden flight to the fourth quarter of 2008, and delaying initial deliveries by around 15 months to the third quarter of 2009. The new schedule included extra time in the testing phase to accommodate unforeseen delays.<ref>[http://www.globeinvestor.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080409.wboeing0409/GIStory/ "Boeing again delays 787 jetliner"], Globe & Mail</ref><ref name="B787_delay_apr2008">[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/787family/news/2008/q2/080409b_nr.html Boeing Revises 787 First Flight and Delivery Plan], Boeing, April 9, 2008.</ref>  While the April 2008 announcement did not directly address delivery schedules, the production rates had previously been planned to increase to 10 per month by 2010, and possibly as high as 16 per month thereafter.<ref>[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/306220_boeingfuselage06.html "Boeing may need 10 Dreamliner fuselages a month."] Gunsalus, J.

In order to keep Boeing's latest schedule, the 787 must complete flight testing over three quarters, in line with the 9 month flight test campaign originally stated. In September 2007, after announcing delays, Mike Bair said that Boeing would keep the Certification Date using six flight-test 787s at a rate of 120 FT hours per month,  higher than the 70-80 FT hours per month used in previous planes.<ref>[http://www.flugrevue.de/index.php?id=864#news_0 "Dreamliner flight delayed"], FLUG Revue September 9, 2007.</ref>  Boeing's previous major aircraft, the 777, took 11 months with nine aircraft flying 7000 FT Hours, partly to demonstrate 180 min-ETOPS, one of its main features.<ref>[http://www.triple7-world.info/html/t77.html "The B777"] Triple7 World Website</ref>

==Design==
===Features===
The 787 features lighter-weight construction. Its materials (by weight) are: 50% composite, 20% aluminum, 15% titanium, 10% steel, 5% other.<ref name=Boeing_AIAA_May_2005></ref> Composite materials are significantly lighter and stronger than traditional aircraft materials, making the 787 a very light aircraft for its capabilities.<ref name=Boeing_787_Fact_Sheet></ref> By volume, the 787 will be 80% composite. Each 787 contains approximately 35 tonnes of carbon fiber reinforced plastic, made with 23 tonnes of carbon fiber.<ref name=Toray_2005_0412></ref> Composites are used on fuselage, wings, tail, doors, and interior. Aluminum is used on wing and tail leading edges, titanium used mainly on engines with steel used in various places.<ref name=Boeing_AIAA_May_2005 />

The longest-range 787 variant can fly 8,000 to 8,500 nautical miles (14,800 to 15,700&nbsp;km), enough to cover the Mach 0.85<ref name="787_bg"></ref> (561&nbsp;mph, 903&nbsp;km/h at typical cruise altitudes).
