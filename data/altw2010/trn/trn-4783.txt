'''Altovski saksofon''' je pihal. Je tretji najmanjši saksofon v družini saksofonov, ki šteje deset inštrumentov. Je najpogosteje uporabljan saksofon, še posebej v klasičnih delih evropskih avtorjev. Zaradi pomanjkanja spoštovanja do izumitelja saksofona, se je le-ta uveljavil šele s pričetki '''jazz''' glasbe v pričetku 20. stoletja v ZDA.

Začetniki se najpogosteje začno učiti igranja bodisi na altovski bodisi na tenorski saksofon, saj se oba zelo pogosto uveljavljata tako v klasični kot jazz glasbi, hkrati pa ponujata dobro podlago za učenje tehnike igranja na saksofon.

Altovski saksofon je uglašen v '''E♭''' (za pol tona znižani E), kar pomeni, da bo ton C, zaigran na altovski saksofon zvenel enako kot ton E♭ na inštrumentu, uglašenem v C tonaliteti (klavir, violina, ipd.).

The '''alto saxophone''' is a variety of the classical compositions.

Because of the music world's lack of respect for Adolphe Sax, the saxophone was not immediately recognized or utilized in the musical community. The saxophone had to wait many years before its potential was recognized. It gained its reputation in American jazz movement, and ever since has been becoming more and more popular.

Because of its prevalence, the alto saxophone is the most common choice for beginners learning to play the saxophone. The second most common saxophone used by beginners is the tenor; teachers often suggest either an alto or a tenor for a beginner depending on their physical size, as well as their preferences.

The alto saxophone is a transposing instrument and reads the treble clef in the key of E (meaning that a written C for the alto will sound as E; concert, a major sixth lower, or a minor third above).

The range of the alto saxophone is from concert D (D3) to concert A (A5) (or A5 on altos with a high F key). The "normal" range as written for the player is B3 to F6 (or F6).<ref>[http://library.thinkquest.org/5116/saxophone.htm Range of the Alto Saxophone]</ref> The third octave, known as the altissimo register, begins at F and extends upwards.  Since the altissimo register of a saxophone is much more difficult to control than other woodwinds, it is usually only expected from advanced players.
