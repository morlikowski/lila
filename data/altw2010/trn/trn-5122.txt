Salomon.

Zapamćen je kao najpravedniji od svih starih glazbenik i pjesnik (napisao mnogo psalma). Davida je izabrao Kršćanski sveti spisi, osobito Novi zavjet ukazuju da je Isus izravan potomak Davida (vidi: Rodoslovlje Isusa Krista). Priroda Davidove vladavine pa čak i samo njezino postojanje ne može se točno dokazati povijesnim ili arheološkim nalazima. Ipak, ovaj lik predstavlja jedan od temelja za Židovsku povijest i Zapadnu kulturu.

== Davidov život ==
=== David i Golijat ===
U vrijeme vladavine kralja Šaula Izraelci su se branili od vojske Filistejaca. David, najmlađi Jišajev sin jednog je dana, donoseći hranu za svoju stariju braću koja su se borila na strani Šaula, čuo za Filistejskog borca, divovskog Golijata. Golijat je izazivao Izraelce da mu pokažu svog šampiona kako bi vidjeli tko je bolji u borbi jedan na jedan. David je, žudeći za dokazivanjem, inzistirao braći da bi mogao poraziti Golijata. Kada je Šaul čuo za ovo, iako nevjerujući, pustio je Davida da izvrši nakanu. I doista, David je porazio Golijata jednim hitcem iz svoje praćke pogodivši ga u čelo i tako ga ubivši. Sada omiljen među Izraelcima, David je pošao Šaulu nosivši mu glavu Golijata na što ga ovaj upita čiji je sin, a David mu odvrati "Ja sam sin Jišaja iz Betlehema". Time će početi i brojni sukobi između kralja Šaula i Davida kao novog pretendenta na prijestolje, do konačne Šaulove pogibije u borbi s Filistejcima i Davidova dolaska na vlast.

'''David''' , Arabic: داوود or داود, '''', "beloved"), was the second king of the united Kingdom of Israel according to the 1037 - 967 BC, his reign over Judah c.1007 - 1000 BC, and over Judah and Israel c.1000 - 967 BC.<ref></ref>  There is little in the archaeological record to substantiate the bible's detailed narrative, but his story, as recorded in the books of Samuel (from I Samuel 16 onwards) and Chronicles, has been of central importance to Jewish and Christian culture.

This section summarizes only a few major episodes from David's life, chosen on the basis of their fame and/or importance in later Christian and Jewish culture.<ref>For a more complete summary of all the episodes in the Saul/David story in Samuel (but excluding Chronicles), see [http://people.brandeis.edu/~buchsbau/MSGPAPERS/sumsam.pdf synopsis]</ref>

=== David is chosen ===
God withdraws his favor from King Lord said [to Samuel], 'Anoint him; for this is he.'"

=== David plays the lyre  before Saul ===
Saul is tormented by an evil spirit. His servants suggest he send for David, "skillful in playing [the harp], a man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence; and the LORD is with him." So David enters Saul's service, and finds favour in his sight, "and whenever the evil spirit was upon Saul, David took the harp and played it with his hand; so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him." ()

=== David and Goliath ===  
The sling, at which the Philistines flee in terror and the Israelites win a great victory. David brings the head of Goliath to Saul, who asks him whose son he is, and David replies, "I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite". <ref>[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Rsv1Sam.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=17&division=div1 1 Samuel 17]</ref>

=== The enmity of Saul ===

Saul makes David a commander over his armies and gives him his daughter Jonathan, one of those who love David. Warned by Jonathan of Saul's intention to kill him, David flees into the wilderness.<ref>[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Rsv1Sam.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=18&division=div1 1 Samuel 18] and subsequent chapters of 1 Samuel.</ref>

=== David in the wilderness ===

In the wilderness David gathers a band of followers and becomes the champion of the oppressed while evading the pursuit of Saul. He accepts Ziklag as a fief from the Philistine king Achish of Gath, but continues to secretly champion the Israelites. Achish marches against Saul, but David is excused from the war on the accusation of the Philistine nobles that his loyalty to their cause cannot be trusted.

=== David is made king ===
Saul and Jonathan are killed in a battle with the Philistines and David mourns their death.<ref>[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Rsv2Sam.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=1&division=div1 2 Samuel 1]; the death of Saul and Jonathan is described in the closing chapter of 1 Samuel.</ref> Then David goes up to Israel.<ref>[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Rsv2Sam.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=2&division=div1 2 Samuel 2:1-10]</ref> War ensues between Ish-Bosheth and David, and Ish-Bosheth is assassinated.

=== King David ===
David conquers the Nathan, forbids it, saying the temple must wait for a future generation. But God makes a covenant with David, promising that he will establish the house of David eternally: "Your throne shall be established forever."<ref>[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Rsv2Sam.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=7&division=div1 2 Samuel 7]</ref> Then David establishes a mighty empire, conquering Zobah and Aram (modern Syria), Edom and Moab (roughly modern Jordan), the lands of the Philistines, and much more.<ref>[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Rsv2Sam.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=8&division=div1 2 Samuel 8] and subsequent chapters.</ref>

=== Bathsheba and Uriah the Hittite ===
250px|thumb|''David and Bathsheba'', by [[Lucas Cranach, 1526.]]

David lies with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite. Bathsheba becomes pregnant and David sends for Uriah, who is with the Israelite army at the siege of Rabbah, that he might lie with her and so conceal the identity of the child's father. Uriah refuses to do so while his companions are in the field of battle and David  sends Uriah back to Joab, the commander, with a message instructing him to abandon Uriah on the battlefield, "that he may be struck down, and die." And so David marries Bathsheba and she bears his child, "but the thing that David had done displeased the LORD."<ref>[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Rsv2Sam.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=11&division=div1 2 Samuel 11]</ref>  

=== God's judgment on David ===

The prophet Nathan speaks out against David's sin, saying: "Why have you despised the word of Yehovah, to do what is evil in his sight? You have smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife." And although David repents, God "struck the child ... and it became sick ... [And] on the seventh day the child died." David then leaves his lamentations, dresses himself, and eats. His servants ask why he lamented when the baby was alive, but leaves off when it is dead, and David replies: "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, who knows whether Yehovah will be gracious to me, that the child may live? But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me."<ref>[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Rsv2Sam.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=12&division=div1 2 Samuel 12]</ref>

=== Absalom ===
David’s beloved son Absalom rebels against his father. The armies of Absalom and David come to battle in the Wood of Ephraim, and Absalom is caught by his hair in the branches of an oak. David’s general Joab kills him as he hangs there. When the news of the victory is brought to David he does not rejoice, but is instead shaken with grief: “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!”

=== The Psalms of David ===
David is described as the author of the majority of the Psalms. One of the most famous is  traditionally said to have been composed by David after Nathan upbraided him over Bathsheba and Uriah. Perhaps the best-known is Psalm 23:
: 
::1  The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
::2  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: 
:::he leadeth me beside the still waters.
::3  He restoreth my soul:         
:::he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
::4  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,         
:::I will fear no evil: for thou art with me;
:::thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
::5  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:         
:::thou anointest my head with oil;
:::my cup runneth over.
::6  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:         
:::and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever."

=== Reign of David ===
"Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.  The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. Then he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead".<ref></ref>

== David in later Abrahamic tradition ==
=== David in Judaism ===
thumb|left|250px|Abishag, Bathsheba, Solomon, and [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan tend to aging David, c. 1435]]
David's reign represents the formation of a coherent Jewish kingdom centered in Jerusalem and the institution of an eternal royal dynasty; the failure of this "eternal" Davidic dynasty after some four centuries led to the later elaboration of the concept of the Messiah, at first a human descendant of David who would occupy the throne of a restored kingdom, later an apocalyptic figure who would usher in the end of time. 

In modern Judaism David's descent from a convert (Ruth) is taken as proof of the importance of converts within Judaism. David is also viewed as a tragic figure; his acquisition of Bathsheba, and the loss of his son are viewed as his central tragedies. 

Many legends have grown around the figure of David. According to one Rabbinic tradition, David was raised as the illegitimate son of his father Jesse and spent his early years herding his father's sheep in the wilderness while his brothers were in school. Only at his anointing by Samuel - when the oil from Samuel's flask turned to diamonds and pearls - was David's true identity as Jesse's legal son revealed. David's piety was said to be so great that his prayers could bring down things from Heaven. His adultery with Bathsheba was only an opportunity to demonstrate the power of repentance and some Talmudic authors stated that it was not adultery at all, quoting a supposed Jewish practice of divorce on the eve of battle to prevent the wives of the missing-in-action from becoming ''agunot''. Furthermore, according to David's apologists, the death of Uriah was not to be considered murder, on the basis that Uriah had committed a capital offence by refusing to obey a direct command from the King.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=82&letter=D#260 Jewish Encyclopedia, "David"]</ref>

According to midrashim<ref>Zohar Bereishis 91b</ref>, Adam gave up 70 years of his life for the life of David. Also, according to the Talmud Yerushalmi, David was born and died on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot (Feast of Weeks).

=== David in Christianity ===
thumb|200px|King David by [[Pedro Berruguete.]] 

Originally an earthly king ruling by divine appointment ("the anointed one", as the title Messiah had it), the "son of David" became in the last two pre-Christian centuries the apocalyptic and heavenly "son of God" who would deliver Israel and usher in a new kingdom. This was the background to the concept of Messiahship in early Christianity, which interpreted the career of Jesus "by means of the titles and functions assigned to David in the mysticism of the Zion cult, in which he served as priest-king and in which he was the mediator between God and man."<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-1727/David "David"] article from ''Encyclopedia Britannica Online''</ref> 

Christians have traditionally believed that the Matthew and Luke therefore trace Jesus' lineage to David in fulfillment of this requirement. 

"Incidents in the life of David [foreshadowed] the life of Christ; the Good Shepherd; the five stones chosen to slay Goliath are typical of the five wounds; the betrayal by his trusted counsellor, Achitophel, and the passage over the Cedron remind us of Christ's Sacred Passion. Many of the Davidic Psalms, as we learn from the New Testament, are clearly typical of the future Messias."<ref>John Corbett (1911) [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04642b.htm King David] ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York: Robert Appleton Company)</ref> 

In the Middle Ages, "Charlemagne thought of himself, and was viewed by his court scholars, as a 'new David'. [This was] not in itself a new idea, but [one whose] content and significance were greatly enlarged by him."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=DhpKxQT8n74C&pg=PA101&lpg=PA101&dq=charlemagne+described+as+a+new+david&source=web&ots=vjwf-CjzXi&sig=52MXxWcu1a_gSiOTNycuSe8XTWc Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity],</ref> Charlemagne's iconographic linking of David to earthly kingship was reflected in later Medieval cathedral windows all over Europe thnrough the device of the Tree of Jesse its branches demonstrating how divine kingship descended from Jesse, through his son David, to Jesus. 

Nativity of the Lord), when he is commemorated together with other ancestors of Jesus. He is also commemorated on the Sunday after the Nativity, together with Joseph and James, the Brother of the Lord.

=== David in Latter Day Saint Doctrine ===
The ''Doctrine and Covenants'' of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints cites David as one directed by God to practice polygamy, but who sinned in committing adultery with Bathsheba and having Uriah killed: 

:"Verily, thus saith the LORD ... David’s wives and concubines were given unto him of me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power; and in none of these things did he sin against me save in the case of Uriah and his wife; and, therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation."<ref>[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/132/1,38-39#1 Doctrine and Covenants 132:1, 38-39] (see highlighted portions).</ref>

This clarifies the LDS doctrine that polygamy is only allowed as directed by the Lord, otherwise it is a grievous sin.<ref>[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/jacob/2/28-30#28 ''Book of Mormon'', Jacob 2:28-30].</ref> The Church forbade polygamy in 1890, citing a revelation given to Wilford Woodruff at that time.<ref>[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/od/1 Doctrine and Covenants, Official Declaration—1]</ref>

=== David in Islam ===<!-- This section is linked from Christianity and Islam -->
David, known in the Islamic tradition as Dawood (), is one of the prophets of Islam, to whom the Zabur (Psalms) were revealed by God (Allah). Some Muslims reject the Biblical portrayal of David as an adulterer and murderer (in association with the story of Uriah and Bathsheba). The rejection is based on the concept of ismah, or the infallibility of the prophets.  The concept is often associated with the Shi'a branch of Islam. See article: Shia Islam

According to some Islamic narrations David was not from Judah but was from Levi and Aron <ref>Behar al Anvar V:13 P:440, Tafseer Al-Qomi V:1 P:82, The story of Prophets of Jazayeri Page 331</ref>

An inscription found at Tel Dan and dated c.850-835 BC has been interpreted as containing the phrase 'House of David'; the Mesha Stele from Moab, and from a similar time, may contain the same phrase; and Kenneth Kitchen has proposed that an inscription of c. 945 BC by the Egyptian Pharaoh Shoshenq I mentions "the highlands of David," but this has been questioned.<ref>See, for example, ''The Tel Dan Inscription: A Reappraisal and a New Interpretation'' [Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 2003], pp. 193-194.
