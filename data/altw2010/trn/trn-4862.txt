== Présentation ==
Kaworu est le 5th Child et aussi le 17ème ange. Il est envoyé à la Eva-02 après la chute dramatique du taux de synchronisation d'Asuka. Il devient très vite intime avec Shinji.

Après avoir pénétré par effraction dans le Central Dogma pour retourner à Adam, il découvre que l'être retenu est en réalité Lilith.

Après un moment très intense de remise en question entre la fidélité à son nouvel (et seul) ami et sa mission de pilote, Shinji est invité par Kaworu à l'éliminer, pour le bien de l'Homme, tout en le remerciant de lui avoir fait comprendre ce qu'est l'âme et l'amour. Shinji finit par obtempérer, en reniant toutes ses croyances et tous ses sentiments. Il en gardera une rancoeur totale pour son père qui l'a conduit à prendre cette décision.

Kaworu est un personnage très populaire parmi les fans alors qu'il n'apparaît que dans un seul épisode (il est donc traité très rapidement). Cet engouement vient certainement du rapport quasi homosexuel qu'il entretient avec Shinji. Cette relation entre le 3rd Child et le 5th Child a fait couler beaucoup d'encre sur Internet. D'après Shinji, Kaworu est la seule personne qu'il ait jamais aimée et il n'y a qu'avec lui qu'il ait réellement pu s'ouvrir. Kaworu est un nom androgyne applicable aussi bien pour un homme ou une femme, ceci augmentant encore l'ambigüité.

 is a Tabris. He is sent to NERV by SEELE as a replacement pilot for Unit 02 after Terminal Dogma to return to Adam, but after he discovers the being there is actually Lilith, he permits Shinji Ikari to destroy him.

== Description ==
It is strongly implied that Kaworu is to SEELE what Second Impact, the fact that the Mass Production Evas bear the word "Kaworu" on their Dummy Plugs suggests that SEELE was in possession of clones of Kaworu just as NERV was in possession of clones of Rei for the Dummy Plug system for the original Evas.  In episode 24, Kaworu tells Rei that they are "the same"; the director's cut expands this scene, as Kaworu goes on to tell Rei that he and she are human vessels for the souls of Adam and Lilith, respectively.  Kaworu and Rei also share distinctive and unusual physical attributes (extremely pale skin, red eyes, and oddly-colored hair) and both can project external AT fields.

Kaworu's dialogue in episode 24 gives clues to the reasons for the Angel attacks:  they seek to return to Adam, thus triggering a form of Third Impact which would annihilate humanity and leave whichever Angel that made contact with Adam as the dominant lifeform on the planet:
<blockquote>"Adam: that from which we came. Must one who was born from Adam return to Adam, even though it would destroy Man?...wait...this is not...Lilith?! I see! I understand now! "The Lilim"; Lilith!"</blockquote>
Kaworu, however, chooses to sacrifice himself for the future of humanity: <blockquote>"This is my wish:  please, destroy me.  Otherwise, you will be destroyed.  Only one life-form can be chosen to evade the destruction and seize the future!  And you are not the existence which should die.  You need the future, it is what you live for!"</blockquote>

Despite his overall importance to the plot Kaworu has less than 13 minutes of screen time (and this at the end of the series, in episode 24). Furthermore, during the last minute of this time, no dialogue or action occurs; it is quite literally a 'static' scene.  Kaworu makes a rather more notable appearance in ''The End of Evangelion'', appearing with Rei inside Shinji's mind as the Professor Fuyutsuki continue the dialogue started by Rei and Kaworu.

Promotional materials for ''Rebuild of Evangelion'' include prominent images of Kaworu in his plugsuit with the other Children.<ref>[http://www.animenewsservice.com/archives/septxxxx.htm Anime News Service, 9-6-06 (6:46PM EDT)---- Confirmed: "Evangelion Shin Gekijou Ban" Details]</ref> He appears briefly at the conclusion of the first film in conversation with Keel. Kaworu will be the pilot of Evangelion Unit 06 in the second Rebuild of Evangelion film.

==Implied homosexuality==
Kaworu's interactions with Shinji have been a persistent topic of debate among fans of ''Evangelion'' since the series's first run. Shinji is unusually open, emotional, and physically receptive when around Kaworu, more so than with any of the other principal characters, while Kaworu treats him with a level of kindness and camaraderie that is completely unfamiliar to Shinji.  In episode 24, Kaworu accompanies Shinji to a bath house. While sitting together in the bath, the boys display a remarkable degree of comfort around one another. At one point, Kaworu places his hand on Shinji's, and rather than hesitate or pull back (as he did in a previous episode, when Misato attempted to touch him), Shinji allows Kaworu's hand to linger on his own. In the English dub, Kaworu says "I love you" to Shinji shortly thereafter. The original Japanese dialogue uses the word "suki" (好き) which can be interpreted as "like" or "love." At the end of the bath house scene, Shinji tells Kaworu that he needs to go to bed, to which Kaworu asks, "With me?" Shinji is quick to decline Kaworu's offer, but he does spend the night at Kaworu's apartment, sleeping on the floor beside Kaworu's bed.  Later, Shinji is devastated by his killing Kaworu, and remarks that Kaworu was the only person in his life to tell him that he was loved.  

The topic is also referred to in largely comedic omake (bonus material).

== Manga version ==
===Adaptation by Sadamoto===
In this manga series, Kaworu is portrayed as being ignorant of human emotions and taboos regarding social interaction and personal space, creating some comic relief. Also, some events concerning him are changed, and he appears earlier as well. He appears briefly at the end of vol. 7 in the presence of SEELE. In his appearance in book 9 (when Shinji first meets him), Shinji finds him playing a piano in the ruins of a church. He asks Shinji if he knows the name of the song, to which Shinji replies "the Ode to Joy." (In the anime, he was sitting on a rock by the sea, humming the tune of the same song.)

Another important difference in this manga is that Shinji initially does not like or trust Kaworu. Just after their first meeting, Kaworu calmly kills an abandoned kitten that had been following Shinji; his pragmatic reply to Shinji's question of "why" (it was kinder to kill the kitten rather than let it eventually starve to death) made Shinji feel that Kaworu was like Rei when Shinji first met her. Later, Kensuke and Hikari see Shinji and Kaworu arguing. Shinji sees them and runs away, and Kaworu looks up and smiles at them; Kensuke thinks to himself, "Creepy...something inhuman..." After Shinji brings Kaworu to NERV, he tells Asuka that she needs to open her heart to her Eva in order to operate it; this line was delivered by Rei in the anime. In the aftermath of the battle with Arael, SEELE interrogates Kaworu, and he mentions that he finds human emotions and attachments fascinating.

In volumes 9 and 10, Kaworu pilots Unit 02 alongside Rei in the battle with the Angel Armisael. The Angel partially assimilates Unit 02, connecting the already-assimilated Rei to Kaworu and causing him to feel Rei's love for Shinji, which makes him cry. After the battle, Shinji nearly punches Kaworu after he calls Rei a fool. Despite this, Shinji stays in Kaworu's apartment rather than go home to Misato, believing that being around the emotionally distant Kaworu would be more tolerable than being around people who would also be sad about Rei's death. He reluctantly accepts Kaworu's offer to share his bed. That night, Shinji begins to hyperventilate while having a nightmare, and Kaworu kisses Shinji, using the lack of a handy paper bag as an excuse. Shinji becomes angered when he wakes fully and realizes what Kaworu did, and is even more angered when Kaworu asks him if what he felt while connected to Rei was love and attempts more advances. Later, after Rei re-appears, Shinji returns to Misato's apartment with the barest of good-byes, visibly upsetting Kaworu. Volume 11 plays out the same way as episode 24. However, Shinji is confused about his feelings towards Kaworu, and the latter tells the former that Kaworu's death at Shinji's hands will allow him to know truthfully what Shinji's feelings towards him are.
