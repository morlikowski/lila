'''Beirut''' (, ''Bayrūt'', Greek: Βηρυττός ''Viryttós'', , Syriac: ܒܝܪܘܬ) is the capital and largest city of Lebanon with a population of over 2,1 million as of 2007. Located on a peninsula at the midpoint of Lebanon's coastline with the Mediterranean sea, it serves as the country's largest and main seaport and also forms the Beirut District area which comprises of the city and its suburbs. The first mention of this metropolis is found in the ancient Egyptian Tell el Amarna letters, dating to the 15th century BC, and the city has been continuously inhabited over the centuries since.

Beirut holds Lebanon's seat of government and plays a central role in the Lebanese economy with its Downtown, Hamra, Verdun, and Ashrafieh based corporate firms and banks. The city is also the focal point of the region's cultural life, renowned for its press, theaters and cultural activities. After the destructive Lebanese civil war, Beirut underwent major reconstruction,<ref>[http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog61/jmhamilton/reconstruct.html Reconstruction of Beirut], Macalester College</ref><ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2004-10/2004-10-27-voa47.cfm?CFID=234705748&CFTOKEN=74239565 Lebanon's Reconstruction: A Work in Progress], VOA News</ref><ref>[http://worldviewcities.org/beirut/elipsis.html Beirut: Between Memory and Desire], Worldview</ref> and the redesigned historic city center, marina, pubs and nightlife districts have once again rendered it a popular tourist attraction.

== History ==
Originally named '''Bêrūt''', "The Wells" by the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Arab and Ottoman remains.<ref>[http://wwwlb.aub.edu.lb/~webpubof/research/21report/as/hist_projects.html Research Projects - History and Archeology], American University of Beirut (AUB)</ref> The first historical reference to Beirut dates from the 14th century BC, when it is mentioned in the cuneiform<ref name=LebEmbU.S. /> tablets of the "Amarna letters." Ammunira of '''Biruta'''<ref>[http://www.case.edu/univlib/preserve/Etana/encyl_biblica_l-p/philologus-pildash.pdf ''Phoenicia''] in Encyclopaedia Biblica, Case Western Reserve University</ref> (Beirut) sent 3 letters to the pharaoh of Egypt.<ref>[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/PER_PIG/PHOENICIA.html?locale=es Phoenicia], Jrank.org</ref> Biruta is also referenced in the letters from  Rib-Hadda of Byblos.  The most ancient settlement was on an island in the river that progressively silted up.  The city was known in antiquity as '''Berytus''' (see also List of traditional Greek place names); this name was taken in 1934 for the archaeological journal published by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the American University of Beirut.<ref>[http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/archaeology/berytus-back/berytus39/ Berytus Archeological Studies], American University of Beirut (AUB)</ref>

In 140 BC, the city was taken and destroyed by Greek: Λαοδικεια ή του Φοινίκη) or '''Laodicea in Canaan''', in honor of a Seleucid Laodice. The modern city overlies the ancient one and little archaeology had been accomplished until after the end of the civil war in 1991; now large sites in the devastated city center have been opened to archaeological exploration. A dig in 1994 established that one of Beirut's modern streets, Souk Tawile, still follows the lines of an ancient Hellenistic/Roman one.

Mid-first century coins of Berytus bear the head of Tyche, goddess of fortune; on the reverse, the city's symbol appears: a dolphin entwines an anchor. This symbol was taken up by the early printer Aldus Manutius in 15th century Venice.

Since the end of the war in 1990, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut, and by the start of the tourist, cultural, and intellectual center in the Middle East, as well as a center for commerce, fashion, and media. However, many would say the city has lost its premier status, due to competition from places like Dubai and Cyprus in the fields of tourism, business, fashion, commerce, and banking. Reconstruction of downtown Beirut has been largely driven by Solidere, a development company established in 1994 by Rafik Hariri. Beirut is home to the international designer Elie Saab, jeweller Robert Moawad, and to some popular satellite television stations, such as LBC, Future TV, New TV and others. The city was host to the Asian Club Basketball Championship and the Asian Football Cup.  Beirut also successfully hosted the Miss Europe pageant eight times, 1960-1964, 1999, 2001-2002.

=== Religion ===
thumb|right|Mosque and Church in Downtown Beirut
<!-- Deleted image removed: thumb|left|Maghen Abraham Synagogue -->
Beirut is one of the most religiously diverse cities of the Christians, and Muslims both having a significant presence. There are nine major religious sects in Beirut (Sunni Muslim, Shiite Muslim, Maronite Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholic, and Protestant). Family matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith. Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities but civil marriages held in another country are recognized by Lebanese civil authorities.
Several decades ago, Beirut was also home to a Jewish community, in Wadi Abu Jamil neighbourhood.

Beirut has had a history of political strife due to religious divisions. Religion has historically divided Lebanese society decisively, as evident in its prolonged civil war.

== Education ==

Higher education in Beirut, and all over Lebanon, is provided by technical and vocational institutes, university colleges, university institutes and universities. Among these numbers of institutions nationwide, the Lebanese University is the only public institution in the capital.<ref name=UnescoEdu>, Unesco.org</ref> The responsibility of the Directorate General of Higher Education is responsible for managing the university colleges, university Institutes and Universities in Beirut and nationwide.<ref name=UnescoEdu />

Among the most famous private schools in Beirut are the American Community School, the Collège Protestant Français, the Collège Louise Wegman and the Grand Lycée Franco-Libanais.

The higher education system is based on the Baccalauréat libanais but the Baccalauréat Français is accepted as an equivalent. Before being admitted to any higher education institution, one must achieve his or her Baccalauréat examinations. Baccalauréat technique is an alternative to credentials.<ref name=UnescoEdu />

Foreign students who wish to study in higher Lebanese institutions must also meet Lebanese qualifications. Their examinations must be equivalent to the Baccalauréat system before they are granted admission to higher institutions. They are not subject to any special quota system, and scholarships are granted within the framework of bilateral agreements concluded with other countries.<ref name=UnescoEdu /> Degrees obtained outside Lebanon must be certified by the Lebanese embassy abroad and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Lebanon. Then, candidates must go in person to the Secretariat of the Equivalence Committee with required documents.<ref>[http://www.informs.gov.lb/EN/Main/SearchDB.asp?choice=ALL&check=1&route=1&txtSearch=education+lebanon Education FAQs], informs.gov.lb</ref>
