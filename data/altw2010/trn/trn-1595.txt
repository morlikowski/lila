'''''Grand Chase''''' (Korean: 그랜드체이스, lit. ''Grand Chase'') is a free-to-play, 2.5D side-scrolling MMORPG developed by the Korean company KOG Studios. The story centers around the adventures of the Grand Chase team.

''Grand Chase'' has servers in Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Brazil, Southeast Asia and the United States. The Taiwan and Hong Kong server calls the game as '''''3小俠''''', whereas in Southeast Asia, it is called '''''GrandChase'''''.

==Story==
While ''Grand Chase'' is primarily a sandbox game, it also has a short back-story for each character, as well as one for the continent of Bermesiah, which is the player's starting point. A continuing story of the Grand Chase universe may be revealed through visiting all the dungeons in the game in the order they are listed.

While the back-story for each character is the same throughout all servers, the back-story of Bermesiah, as well as the spelling of certain places, may differ across servers, although the events which took place are more or less similar.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name=MobyBrazil></ref>

===Storyline===

<!-- For you SEA players out there READ THIS FIRST! This is International English wikipedia, so do not change International context to SEA context. For example, changing KazeAze to KazeAaze and Lass to Las. This is equivalent to changing KazeAze to Cazeaje-->

The Kingdoms of Serdin and Kanavan have always thrived side-by-side on Bermesiah in peace for as long as anyone could remember, until the Queen of Darkness, KazeAze, infiltrated Kanavan, killed the ruling queen's most trusted advisor, disguised herself as him, and manipulated the Queen of Kanavan to wage a full-scale war with Serdin which lasted for five years. Many lives were lost in battle and much of the continent was levelled until either queen discovered who the culprit was. By then, it was too late, for KazeAze had fled. The Queen of Kanavan dispatched a group of elite warriors, known as Trackers, to find KazeAze, but all of them disappeared mysteriously.

The Queen of Serdin was determined to prevent another war of such devastating magnitude from taking place on Bermesiah again. To this effect, she created an army of warriors who are aligned to no one, and will fight for the tranquility of the entire continent. She called this army "Grand Chase".

==Gameplay==

Gameplay in ''Grand Chase'' is primarily keyboard-driven, although the game menu's interface is, by contrast, primarily mouse-driven, although some in-game key commands may be user-defined. Due to the combos and special attacks, the game has a feel that is similar to side-scrolling fighting games such as Street Fighter 2 or Double Dragon, while the appearance and design of the backdrops, as well as the characters and monster, puts the game in an anime-esque setting. While it is an action game, the designers took care to not make a "button masher".<ref name=Interview></ref>

The game is free-to-play, where players need to earn currency known as Game Points from completing quests, individual missions, or defeating other players to buy better equipments or items, but there are some items that can only be purchased with real-world currency. In ''Grand Chase'', players start off and role-play as one of three main heroines, and will be able to unlock more playable characters by completing specific missions. However, the player may freely switch among the characters he or she has unlocked between missions, each with their own specific equipment and experience level.<ref></ref>

==Leveling up==
After each trip into a dungeon, characters gain experience points. While the amount of experience gained is partially dependent on the player's performance in a dungeon, and the player's character's level, every player will gain some experience. The player's character is also given additional experience upon the completion of every mission. When sufficient experience is obtained, the player's character will advance by one level. Higher levels improve statistics and grant access to better equipment. Experience can also be gained through player versus player, and the amount of experience gained through this game mode is significantly higher than the amount awarded through the completion of dungeons at higher level.<ref name=Interview/>

==Party==
When entering dungeons, it is advisable to form a party. The game's interface makes it easy to create a party or join one created by another player. Friends can lock their party with a password or leave it open to everyone. The items that are found in the dungeons are shared by the party. To encourage group play, there is a slight experience boost when working together. Because each party has a maximum limit of four players, and each player may freely chooses whichever character he or she wants to use, there is a chance that two or more players will control the same playable character. However, they can be identified separately through the player's screen name.

==Player versus Player==
Players can also compete against one another in combat. There are various modes of player versus player combat: three-on-three team battles, six-player free-for-all or Arena. Win/loss statistics are tracked for these matches. Team matches encourage players to plan their attack strategies and experiment with various formations. Six player free-for-all is a survival of the fittest, where only the last man standing wins. Arena mode balances all the game stats, and the player must select three characters in his or her hand. If one of his or her character dies, another character he or she selected will take the fallen character's place.<ref></ref>

==Characters==

<!-- For you SEA players out there READ THIS FIRST! This is International English wikipedia, so do not change International context to SEA context. For example, changing KazeAze to KazeAaze and Lass to Las. This is equivalent to changing KazeAze to Cazeaje! -->

There are seven playable characters to play and players may switch characters between dungeons. Each character is leveled and equipped separately. Most equipment is character-specific, and the choice of character is similar to class choice in most MMORPGs.<ref></ref>

;Elesis 
:Elesis is a Kanavan Knight and daughter of a Kanavan Tracker who never returned after he was dispatched to find KazeAze. Her reason for joining Grand Chase is to find her missing father whom she loved. Elesis has the most defense out of all characters, and specializes in close- and medium-ranged combat. She is also notable for her ability to reflect arrows, and her ability to "Berserk", which causes all enemies within her range to levitate and drop onto the ground, receiving considerable damage.
