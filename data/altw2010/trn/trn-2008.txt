'''Ford Super Duty''' yra komerciniai pikapai, kuriuos Ford Motor Company pristatė 1998 metais, kaip 1999 metų modelius.

==1 Karta (1999-2004)==
1999 metias buvo pristatyta nauji F-250 ir F-350 Super Duty pikapai. Jie buvo dideli pikapai su daug sunkesniais rėmais ir komponentais nei F-150. Super Duty turėjo 3 galimus variklius. 5,4 l V-8 buvo standartinis, tačiau 6,8 l V-10 benzininis ir ''Powerstroke'' turbo dyzelis buvo labai populiarūs. 7,3 l V-8 ''Powerstroke'' turbo dyzelis buvo siūlomas nuo 1999 iki 2003 metų. Kartu su šiais modeliais buvo pristatyti ir nauji patogūs interjerai. Visureigių dizainai pirmaą kartą buvo kuriamas pagal F-150 nors jie komponentais nesidalino su F-150 platforma. Buvo trys kabinų variantai: Standatinė 2-durų (2-3 žmonėms), ''SuperCab'' su mažomis galinėmis durimis (5-6 žmonėms) ir ''CrewCab'' 4-durų (4-6 žmonėms).

==2 Karta (2005-2007)==
2005 metais Super Duty buvo atnaujinti. Visureigiai gavo naujas groteles, nauja interjerą ir gamykliškai instaliuota treilerio stabdžių kontrolę. Vairkliai taip pat buvo atnaujinti. Pikapai gavo naujus 5,4l V8 ir 6,8l V10 variklius turinčius 300 ir 362 AG.

==3 Karta (2008-)==
Super Duty pikapai turėjo būti visiškai atanujinti gegužę buvo paskelbta, kad atnaujinimas atidedamas Power Stroke dyzeliniu V8 varikliu, kuri pakeitė iki tol naudotą problematišką 6,0 litrų Power Stroke V8 variklį. Teigiama jog naujasis variklis turi 350 AG (260 kW) ir 650 ft·lbf sukimo momentą.

The '''Ford Super Duty''' is a line of commercial trucks (over  GVWR) introduced in 1998 for the 1999 model year. The F-250 to F-550 Super Duties are assembled at the Kentucky Truck Assembly in Louisville, Kentucky.  The F-650 & F-750 Super Duties are assembled at the Blue Diamond Truck plant in Mexico. 

The Super Duty trucks are larger, heavier built commercial/industrial series pickup trucks with heavier-duty body-on-frame steel ladder frames, axles, springs, brakes, transmissions, more powerful engines, and all other heavier/bigger components (with much higher payload and towing capacities) than the older traditional equivalent F-250, F-250HD (Heavy Duty), & F-350 Ford truck lines. In appearance, the Super Duty line might look a little similar to but does not share any of the design or build characteristics of the F-150. A F-250 Super Duty would surpass the older traditional F-350 in most categories.

For the 1999 model year, Ford dropped the regular (now to be considered the 'light duty') F-250, F-250HD (Heavy Duty), and F-350 truck lines only to introduce all-new F-250 and F-350 Super Duty trucks. By using two separate but related platforms for F-Series trucks, the inevitable compromises inherent in offering a wide range of load-carrying capacities were avoided.  The main competition, General Motors, liked the idea so much that for the 2001 model year, the Chevrolet Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD were introduced. 

The Super Duty had several available engines. A 2-valve per cylinder 5.4&nbsp;L Modular V10 with  and 425 foot-pounds of Power Stroke turbodiesel with   and of torque from 1999 to 2002 and upped to 250 hp and 525 ft lbs of torque in 2003. The 6.0&nbsp;L Power Stroke with a variable-vane turbo was phased in starting in 2003; this engine produced  and  of torque.

Four transmissions were available. A standard 5-speed manual for gas engines, a standard 6-speed manual for diesel engines, an optional 4R100 4-speed automatic for gas, and an optional 5-speed automatic for Diesels. The 4-speed automatic was replaced in the 2003 model year truck with 6.0L Diesel engine by the new Torqshift 5-speed 5R110 automatic transmission. The 5-speed manual 1st to 5th gear ratios are 5.72, 2.94, 1.61, 1, & 0.76:1 with Reverse being 5.24:1.  The 4-speed auto 1st to 4th gear ratios are 2.71, 1.54, 1, & 0.71:1 with Reverse being 2.88:1. The TorqShift '5-speed' auto 1st to 5th gear ratios are 3.09, 2.2, 1.54, 1, & 0.71:1 Reverse 2.88.  The TorqShift design in fact has six forward ratios, but only five are advertised, with the 'hidden' gear only used in extreme cold weather.

These trucks were styled distinctly different for the first time from the smaller F-150 half-ton pickups. They did not share components with the F-150 platform at all, even though it was still considered an F-series truck. Instead of the aero look, it was more boldly angular with a raised hood and lowered fenders, somewhat like fender / hood medium truck style pioneered by the 1994 thumb|left|250px|2002 Ford F-250 with  enclosed [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer for four motorcycles]]There were three cab options: Standard (2-3 passengers) with two doors, SuperCab (5-6 passengers) with 2 reverse-opening small rear doors (4 doors), and the crew cab with 4 full doors and seats for 4-6 people. The Super and Crew cabs came with 6&thinsp;¾-foot and 8-foot full-size bed options, but the Standard cab was only available with the 8' bed. The F-250 Super Duty would also be the base platform for the short-lived Ford Excursion which was the only passenger SUV larger than the Chevrolet Suburban and its twin, the GMC Yukon XL.

The Ford F-250 and related F-4000 were built in Brazil from 2000 to 2006. Brazilian trucks were widely exporting including Australia, South Africa and Argentina (where they were sold as the F-100).

Major changes over the previous generation of Super Duties includes increased payload (GVWR) & towing (GCWR) capacities, a new taller front grille, new interior, standard locking tailgate, 10-17% thicker partially boxed frame, higher amp alternator, upgraded & larger 4-wheel disc brakes (13.66-in front & 13.39-in rear rotors) with huge twin caliper pistons, upgraded engines, upgraded automatic transmission option, an all new optional built-into-dash Ford TowCommand TBC (Trailer Brake Controller) that is fully integrated with the truck's PCM (Powertrain Control Module) and ABS (Anti-lock Braking System), an all new optional built-into-dash 4 AUX upfitter switches (for adding off road lights, winches, snow plows, etc.), and an optional drivers side glove compartment.

The front suspension on Dana Super 60 axle, but switched from leaf springs to coils and added a limited-slip rear differential, added skid plates for the fuel tank and transfer case, and two "FX4" decals on both back bed-sides instead of the standard "4x4". For all 4x4 models, the 2-speed transfer case 4x4-LOW range has a gear reduction of 2.72:1.

The front suspension on 4x2 models is independent twin I-beam with coil springs. 

The rear suspension on all models uses a 10.5-inch Sterling (once the heavy duty truck division of Ford) 35-spline axle with choices of conventional or limited-slip differentials in 3.73, 4.10, and 4.30:1 ratios.  All models have heavy duty 3" wide stabilizer bar on DRW (dual rear wheel) models. An optional slide-in camper certification package with heavier springs and an optional stabilizer bar package are available on SRW (single rear wheel) models. 

The two previous gas engines were upgraded from the old 2 valve per cylinder to 3 valve (2 intake & 1 exhaust) per cylinder. The standard 5.4&nbsp;L V8 puts out  and  of torque, and the optional 6.8&nbsp;L V10 puts out  & . 

The 6.0&nbsp;L 32 valve pushrod actuated Power Stroke single-turbo diesel was also modified, boosting torque to , but power remained the same as previous version with .  Due to very high warranty exposure and over 500 vehicle full buy backs (due to the Lemon Law), late 2006 was the last of the 6.0&nbsp;L diesels.  The major problem with the Navistar diesel engines are due to damage resulting from defective fuel injectors. There were also minor problems resulting from the unreliable factory variable-vane turbocharger, EGR valve carbon deposit clogging/sticking, defective Exhaust Pressure (EP) sensor/connector, extensive PCM recalibrations, fuel injector harness chafing/crushing, general engine stalling/bucking, and inability to conform to the new Federal diesel emissions standards of January 1, 2007.

Ford's "Fail-Safe Cooling System" is unique. This system is designed to protect the engine due to loss of coolant (since these engines can not overheat for being 'overworked'). If the engine overheats, it will automatically switch from 8/10 cylinder (depending on V8 or V10 engine) operation to alternating 4/5 cylinder (depending on V8 or V10 engine) operation. Because there is now 50% less hot combustion, the engine will operate cooler.  The vehicle will continue to operate, but with very limited engine power.  The now so-called 'dead' cylinders also act like an air pump to cool the engine down even more.  This system allows the driver to travel a short distance to obtain service or to reach a repair facility. The distance that can be traveled depends upon vehicle load, outside temperature, and current road conditions. 

Only 2 transmissions are available. The standard M6OD 6-speed manual overdrive and the optional heavy duty TorqShift 5R110W 5-speed automatic overdrive with Tow/Haul mode which replaced the 4-speed 4R100 used in the first generation.  This Torqshift 5-speed transmission also became available on all versions of the trucks marketed.  On the TorqShift, once the Tow/Haul mode is activated it can help increase a driver's control when towing large loads up and down steep grades and automatically minimizes shifts and maximizes available torque. Upon descent, the Tow/Haul mode utilizes engine braking to help extend brake life and improve driver control.  An adaptive shift function monitors the TorqShift's performance over its lifetime, and adjusts shift pressures in real time to assure consistent shift feel and compensate for wear.  For ease of maintenance, the TorqShift's oil filter is a spin-off style, mounted on the passenger-side exterior of the transmission. Also the TorqShift's larger fluid lines and a larger transmission oil cooler help to assure cooler operating temperatures, even under the most demanding conditions. 

The TorqShift 5-speed auto 1st to 5th gear ratios are 3.11, 2.22, 1.55, 1.00, & 0.71:1. It also utilizes an alternate 4th gear, overdrive on 2nd gear of the 3 speed automatic component (0.72 x 1.55), that is 1.10:1 that is used under cold start conditions to aid engine and transmission warm up. The 6-speed manual 1st to 6th gear ratios are 5.79, 3.30, 2.10, 1.30, 1.00, & 0.72:1.  Trucks with the optional TorqShift 5-speed automatic are rated at exactly  higher towing capacity then trucks with the standard 6-speed manual transmission.

Ford offers a PTO (power take-off) which provides direct engine power for accessory equipment without the expense and installation time of separate, independently mounted electric motors or other power sources. The standard equipment 6-speed manual transmission comes with an integrated PTO.  The optional TorqShift 5-speed automatic transmission can be equipped with an integrated PTO provision (it automatically locks the torque converter providing power to the PTO gear when the operator turns on the PTO switch).
