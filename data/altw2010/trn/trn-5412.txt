Dono huet en zu Mailand, Bologna a London Economie studéiert. Vun 1963 u war e wëssenschaftleche Mataarbechter, zënter 1966 Chargé de cours a vun 1971 bis 1999 Professer fir Macro-Economie an Industriepolitik zu Bologna.

1978 bis 1979 war de Prodi Industrieminister an der Regierung vum Giulio Andreotti. 

Vun 1984 bis 1995 (ausser tëscht 1989 an 1993) war e President vun der IRI, der gréisster staatlecher Holding vun Italien, déi e matgehoillef huet, ze sanéieren an deelweis ze privatisiéieren. 

1995 waren de Spëtzekandidat vun der Walunioun  ''Ulivo'' ("Olivebam"), an deer eng sëlleche Parteien, vu lénksextreme bis konservativen, zesummegeschloss waren. 1996 gouf e Ministerpresident. Heen huet de Staatsbudget streng an der Gitt gehalen a kunnt esou Italien erméiglechen, der Euro-Zon bäizetrieden. Am Oktober 1998 ass en zeréckgetrueden, nodeems eng Partei vum Olovebam d'Regierung nët méi ënnerstëtzt hat an en e Vertrauensvote verluer hat.

De Staats a Regierungsdchefe vun der EU hien zum President vun der Europäescher Commissioun ernimmt. Hien huet de Europäesche Parlament confirméiert gi war.

A seng Amtszäit falen d'Aféiere vum Euro an d'Verhandlungen mat an de Bäitrëtt vun 10 neie Memberstaaten an d'EU, den 1. Mee 2004. De Prodi huet um Enn vu senger Presidentschaft ze verstoe ginn, dass e gäer nees méi an der italienescher Politik (wou an der Tëschenzäit de Silvio Berlusconi Premierminister war) aktiv wier, an esou huet den Europäesche Conseil de José Manuel Barroso als neie Kommissiounspresident designéiert, deen dëst Amt zënter dem November 2004 un huet.

De 16. Oktober 2005 gouf de Romano Prodi bei enger Virwal mat iwwer 70 % zum Spëtzekandidat vun der Mëtt-Lénks-Unioun ''Unione'' fir d'Parlamentswale vun 2006 gewielt. Dës huet en dann och géint de Silvio Berlusconi (knapps) gewonnen.

D'Koalitioun, déi dorausser ervirgoung, an déi eng Rëtsch kleng méi oder manner lénksextrem Parteien emfaasst, steet op wackeleche Féiss: Bei engem Vote am Senat iwwer d'Aussepolitik, am Februar 2007,  hu sech d'Kommunisten enthale gehat, sou dass d'Regierungsparteie minoritär waren. De Prodi huet säi Récktrëtt ugebueden, mee de Staatspresident huet hie gebieden, d'Regierung engem Vertrauensvote z'ënnerwerfen, woumatter se dann an hirem Amt confirméiert gouf.

De 24. Januar 2008 huet hien sech op en neies engem Vertauensvote am Senat gestallt, nodeems säi Justizminiter zeréckgetruede war. Dës Kéier krut en net méi déi néideg Majoritéit an huet säi Récktrëtt ugebueden.

 (born Italian politician and statesman. He served as President of the Council of Ministers (prime minister) of President of the European Commission from 1999 to 2004.

Prodi ran in 1996 as Olive Tree candidate, winning the election and serving as The Union'' (''L'Unione'') coalition over the ''April 2006 Italian elections he was in power again. On 24 January 2008, he lost a vote of confidence in the Senate house, and consequently tendered his resignation as prime minister to Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, but was in office for almost four months for the routine business, until early elections were held and a new government was formed.

On Democratic Party. 

==Personal==
Prodi was born in oncologist and biosemiotician).

Prodi married cardinal.<ref></ref><ref></ref> They have two sons, Giorgio and Antonio. He and his family still live in Bologna.

==Academic career==
After completing his secondary education at the  ''Liceo Ludovico Ariosto'' in Reggio Emilia, Prodi graduated in law at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Milan in 1961, with a thesis on the role of Protectionism in the development of Italian industry. He then carried out postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics.<ref>[http://www.romanoprodi.it/cgi-bin/adon.cgi?act=doc&doc=28 Biography of Romano Prodi] (in Italian)</ref>

In 1963, he became a competition regulations and the development of small and medium businesses. He is also interested in relations between states and markets, and the dynamics of the different capitalistic models.

Prodi has received almost 20 honorary degrees from institutions in Italy, and from the rest of Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa. 

==Politics==
===Beginnings===
Prodi's political career began as a left-of-centre reformist Christian Democrat and a disciple of Minister of Industry. During Giulio Andreotti's government in 1978  he served as a ''Technical Minister''; through the 1980s and early 1990s he continuously served various government committees.

On Ouija board. Whilst during this supposed séance Prodi thought the word Gradoli referred to a town on the outskirts of Rome, it probably referred to the Roman address of a Red Brigades safe house, located at no. 96, Via Gradoli. Later, other Italian members of the European Commission claimed Prodi had invented this story to conceal the real source of the tip-off, which they believed to have originated somewhere among the far-left Italian political groups.<ref></ref>. 

This issue came back again in 2005, when Prodi was accused of being "a KGB man" by Mitrokhin Commission. 

From 1982-1989 and 1993-1994 Prodi, an expert economist and negotiator, was CEO of the powerful state-owned industrial holding company IRI. Though in this position he twice came under investigation - firstly for an alleged conflict of interest in relation to contracts awarded to his own economic research company, and secondly concerning the sale of the loss-making state-owned food conglomerate SME to the multinational Unilever, for which he had, for a time, been a paid consultant - however he was fully acquitted on both counts.

===Olive Tree and first cabinet (1996-1998)===

In 1995 Prodi was one of the founders of the centre-left Pole of Freedoms coalition in the 1996 Italian general election. This led to his nomination as President of the Council of Ministers, as the position of Prime Minister is usually called in Italy. His program consisted in continuing the past governments' work of restoration of the country's economic health, in order to pursue the then seemingly unreachable goal of leading the country within the strict European Monetary System parameters and make the country join the Euro. He succeeded in this in little more than six months. His government fell in 1998 when the Communist Refoundation Party withdrew its support. This led to the formation of a new government led by Massimo D'Alema as Prime Minister. There are those who claim that D'Alema deliberately engineered the collapse of the Prodi government to become Prime Minister himself (such speculations being the essence of Italian politics). As the result of a vote of no confidence in Prodi's government, D'Alema's nomination was passed by a single vote. This was the first and so far, the only occasion in the history of republican Italy on which a vote of no confidence had ever been called; the Republic's many previous governments had been brought down by a majority "no" vote on some crucially important piece of legislation (such as the budget).

===President of the European Commission (1999–2004)===

In September 1999 Prodi, a prominent pro-European, became President of the European Commission, thanks to the support of both the Christian Democrat and the Social Democratic parties in the European Parliament. It was during Prodi's presidency, in 2002, that eleven EU member states abandoned their national currencies and adopted the Euro as their single currency; and in 2004, still during Prodi's presidency, the EU was enlarged to admit several more countries, most of them formerly part of the Soviet bloc. Prodi's mandate expired on the 18 November 2004, whereupon he returned to domestic politics.

===Prodi's return to Italian politics and his second government===

Shortly before the end of his term as President of the European Commission, Prodi returned to national Italian politics at the helm of the centre-left coalition, The Union.

Having no party of his own, in order to officially state his candidacy for the 2006 general election, Prodi ideated an apposite primary election, the first of such kind to be ever introduced in Europe and seen by its creator (Prodi himself) as a democratic move to bring the public and its opinion closer to the Italian politics, held on October 2005, which he won with over 70% of votes. Over four million people for the occasion went to cast a vote in the primary election. He thus led his coalition to the electoral campaign preceding the election, eventually won by a very narrow margin of 25,000 votes, and a final majority of two seats in the Senate, on April 10. Prodi's appointment was somewhat delayed, as the outgoing President of the Republic, election of Giorgio Napolitano to replace Ciampi, Prodi could proceed with his transition to government. On May 16 he was invited by Napolitano to form a government. The following day, Prodi and his cabinet were sworn in.

Romano Prodi and his cabinet were sworn in on 17 May 2006. Prodi's cabinet drew in politicians from across his centre-left winning coalition, in addition to Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, an unelected former official of the European Central Bank with no partisan membership.

Romano Prodi obtained the support for his cabinet on 19 May at the Senate and on 23 May at the Chamber of Deputies. Also on May 18, Prodi laid out some sense of his new foreign policy when he pledged to withdraw Italian troops from Iraq and called the Iraq war a "grave mistake that has not solved but increased the problem of security".<ref></ref>

The coalition led by Romano Prodi, thanks to the electoral law which gives the winner a sixty seat majority, can count on a good majority in the Chamber of Deputies but only on a very narrow majority in the Senate. The composition of the coalition is very varied, throwing parties of Communist inspiration like "Comunisti Italiani" (Party of Italian Communists) and "Rifondazione Comunista" (Communist Refoundation Party) together with parties of Catholic and liberal inspiration, like "Margherita" (Democracy is Freedom – Daisy) and "UDEUR" (Union of Democrats for Europe), led by Clemente Mastella, a former member of Christian Democratic Party. Therefore, according to critics, it is difficult to have a single policy in different key areas, such as economics and foreign politics (for instance, Italian military presence in Afghanistan). In his earlier months as PM, Prodi had a key role in the creation of a multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon following the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict.

====2007 crisis, resignation and reappointment====
Prodi's government faced a crisis over policies in early 2007, after just nine months of government. Three ministers in Prodi's Cabinet boycotted a vote in January to continue funding for Italian troop deployments in Afghanistan. Lawmakers approved the expansion of the US military base Caserma Ederle at the end of January, but the victory was so narrow that Deputy Prime Minister Francesco Rutelli criticised members of the coalition who had not supported the government. At around the same time, Justice Minister Clemente Mastella, of the coalition member Popular–UDEUR, said he would rather see the government fall than support its unwed couples legislation.<ref></ref>

Tens of thousands of people marched in Senate to vote for or against it. In spite of the fear of many senators that Prodi's defeat would return Silvio Berlusconi to power, the Senate did not approve a motion backing Prodi's government foreign policy, two votes shy of the required majority of 160.<ref></ref>
