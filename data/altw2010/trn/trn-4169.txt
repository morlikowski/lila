The Canton of '''Vaud''' (French pronunciation ) is one of the 26 cantons of Switzerland and is located in Romandy, the southwestern part of the country. The capital is Lausanne.

==Geography==
thumb|200px|left
The canton stretches from Jura ranges in the west, the canton borders the French Jura, and Doubs. In the east, it borders canton of Fribourg and canton of Bern. The total area is .

In the north, there is an exclave containing Avenches surrounded by canton of Fribourg and Lake Neuchâtel. On the other hand, there are two enclaves of the canton of Fribourg, as well as two enclaves of the canton of Geneva, that are surrounded by the canton of Vaud.

The areas in the southeast are mountainous, part of the Swiss Alps. The Diablerets Glacier, peaking at , rests in these mountains, which also host several popular skiing destinations such as Villars, Les Diablerets and Leysin. The central area of the canton, in contrast, consists of moraines and is thus hilly. There are plains along the lakes.

==History==<!-- This section is linked from House of Savoy -->
Along the lakes, Vaud was inhabited in prehistoric times. Later on, the Celtic tribe of the Caesar's troops in Romans settled the area. The towns of Vevey () and Lausanne (''Lausonium'' or ''Lausonna'') are two of the many towns established by the Romans.

In 2nd and the 4th century the area was repeatedly invaded by Alemannic tribes, and in the 5th century the Burgundians occupied the area. The Merovingian Franks later replaced the Burgundians. Their occupancy did not last long either, and in 888 the area of the canton of Vaud was made part of the Carolingian Empire. In 1032 the Zähringens of Germany defeated the Burgundians. The Zähringens themselves were succeeded in 1218 by the counts of Savoy. It was only under the counts of Savoy that the area was given political unity, establishing what is today in greater part known as the canton of Vaud. A part stretching from Attalens to the River Sarine, in the north, was absorbed by the canton of Fribourg.

As the power of the Savoys declined at the beginning of the 15th century the land was occupied by troops from Bern. By 1536 the area was completely annexed. Reformation was started by co-workers of John Calvin like Pierre Viret, including a famous debate at the cathedral of Lausanne; but it was only decisively implemented when Bern put its full force behind it. The Bernese occupants were not popular amongst the population and the French Revolutionary troops were received with enthusiasm in 1798. The French troops were victorious and a ''Lemanic Republic'' was declared. This was soon turned into the canton of Léman, which in 1803 joined the Swiss confederation.

The current constitution dates from April 14 2003, replacing the one from 1885. In the 19th century the canton of Vaud was an outspoken opponent of the Catholic separatist movement (''Sonderbund'').

==Culture==
Vaud shares a lot with its fellow French-speaking Geneva and Neuchâtel.  It has still a strong rural component, protected by high subsidies, even if most of the economy and population are now urbanised, around services (finance, telecommunications, tourism) and industry (packaging, tobacco, food-processing, watchmaking, pharmaceuticals &c).  There are survivals of its own Franco-Provençal patois, around which an association was formed.

Quality of life is very high, but natality is very low. Life expectancy is high. Education shares the generally high Swiss standards.

==Economy==
The capital Lausanne is the major city in the canton. There are light industries concentrated around it. In 1998, 71.7% of the workers worked in the tertiary sector and 20.8% in the secondary.

The canton is the second largest producer of wine in Switzerland. Most of the wine produced in the canton is white wine, and most vineyards are located on the steep shores of Lake Geneva. There is agriculture in the areas away from Lake Geneva. Sugar beet is important around Orbe, tobacco in La Broye Valley and fruit is grown on the foot of the Jura mountains. Cattle breeding and pasture are common in the Alps and the Jura mountains. There is a salt mine at Bex. Tourism is important in many towns along the Lake Geneva. Major lakeside resorts include Lausanne, Montreux and Vevey.

==Education==
The Canton is home to several renowned universities and schools:

*Swiss Federal institute of Technology, Lausanne (EPFL)
*University of Lausanne (UNIL)
*International Institute for Management Development (IMD)
*École Cantonale d'Art de Lausanne, Lausanne Art School (ECAL)
