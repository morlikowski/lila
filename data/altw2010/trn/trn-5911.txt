Bishop '''Jacques Jean Edmond Georges Gaillot''' (born French Catholic clergyman and social activist. He was from 1982 to 1995 bishop of Évreux in France. In 1995, he was demoted to titular bishop of Partenia, an extinct diocese, for having expressed too loudly, in the view of his hierarchy, liberal positions on political and social matters.

It is these viewpoints and unorthodox stances that have earned Gaillot the nickname of '''The Red Cleric'''.<ref>Reuters. [http://www.aegis.com/news/ads/1995/AD950105.html French Against Vatican Sacking of "Red Cleric"] 17 January, 1995</ref> 

==Education and early career==
Jacques Gaillot was born in Champagne. As a teenager, he already desired to become a priest. After his secondary studies, he entered the seminary in Langres.

From 1957 to 1959, he carried out his compulsory military service in war of independence.

From 1960 to 1962 he was sent to ordained a priest in 1961.

From 1962 to 1964, he was sent to the Higher Institute for Liturgy in Paris, while teaching at the major seminary in Châlons-en-Champagne.

From 1965, he was a Professor at the regional seminary of Reims. He chaired many sessions to implement the orientations of the Second Vatican Council.

In 1973, he was appointed to the parish of St Dizier, his hometown, while becoming co-manager of the institute for the training of the educators of the clergy (IFEC) in Paris.

In 1977, he was appointed vicar general of the diocese of Langres. In 1981, he was elected vicar capitular. In May 1982, he was appointed bishop of Évreux, being consecrated into the position on 20 June. <ref>Diocese of Partenia. [http://www.partenia.org/english/biographie_eng.htm] January, 2007</ref>

==Media attention and controversy==
As soon as Bishop Gaillot had taken place in Évreux he began to engage in activities that may be said to have cost him his position. During his first Easter message he wrote: "Christ died outside the walls as he was born outside the walls. If we are to see the light, the sun, of Easter, we ourselves must go outside the walls." Following this he then stated that: "I'm not here to convince the convinced or take care of the well. I'm here to support the ill and offer a hand to the lost. Does a bishop remain in his cathedral or does he go into the street?. . .I made my choice." Within months Gaillot had begun to act on his word. <ref>Commonweal.

In 1983, he supported a conscientious objector before the court in Évreux. During the yearly assembly of the episcopate, he was one of the two bishops (of a total of 110) voting against the episcopate's text on nuclear deterrence, which supported having nuclear arms as a legitimate deterrent.<ref>Commonweal. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1252/is_n17_v122/ai_17564085/pg_1 Provocateur or prophet? The French church & Bishop Gaillot pg.1] 6 October, 1995</ref>

In 1984 he angered numerous Catholic authorities by refusing to support the movement in defence of French parochial schools.

In 1985, he supported the First Intifada in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and met Yasser Arafat in Tunis, being embraced by the controversial figure in a private audience. Perhaps the most notable event he performed in 1987 was attending, by invitation, a special session of the United Nations in New York to speak out for disarmament. The first amount of considerable media attention paid to Gaillot came in January 1985 when he signed an appeal on behalf of underpaid Catholic school teachers; also signing the appeal was Georges Marchais, the head of the French Communist Party. This proved to be highly controversial, bringing about the start of a right-wing campaign against Bishop Gaillot.  Within his own diocese, Le Figaro spear-headed the campaign. At this point Bishop Gaillot was described as being "a tool of the church's worst enemies"<ref>ibid.</ref>

In 1987, he went to National Front were even stronger. Also in 1987 Gaillot traveled to Athens to show solidarity with a boatload of Palestinian refugees.

In 1988, during a closed-door session of the assembly in Lourdes, he advocated the ordination of married men to the priesthood. After the proceedings had finished Gaillot spoke to the press about the discussions held and also promoted his own viewpoints. By promoting a revision of clerical celibacy and the use of condoms, he caused considerable tension with the French bishops' conference, the situation being exacerbated by the fact that in speaking to the media about the session, Gaillot had violated convention regarding assembly conclaves. He later defended his previous actions, remarking that "I never broke the vow of celibacy ... I only questioned it. But that's worse."<ref>ibid.</ref>  Also that year, Gaillot took the unprecedented step for a Roman Catholic bishop of blessing a homosexual union in a "service of welcoming", after the couple requested it in view of their imminent death from AIDS.

In 1989, he participated in a trip to Panthéon, a necropolis for the great men of France. Grégoire had been instrumental in the first abolition of slavery, and the end of discrimination against the Blacks and the Jews during the French Revolution. The hierarchy of the Catholic Church had refused to give him the last sacraments because of Grégoire's acceptance of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Gaillot was the only French bishop participating in this ceremony. By this stage in his career, Bishop Gaillot had earned an impressive reputation, both positive and negative. The French journalist Henri Tincq wrote in ''Le Monde'' that "[Bishop Gaillot] has the merit of saying out loud what many people in authority in the church think down deep."<ref>ibid.</ref>

Throughout 1989 Gaillot continued to cause considerable tension within the French Bishops' Conference, to the extent that the members of the episcopate voted to censure him. This disciplinary action came after Gaillot gave an interview to the publication ''Lui'', the French equivalent of ''Playboy''. Furthermore, he also gave interviews to leading gay magazines and lambasted the incompetence of the Roman Catholic hierarchy to judge the circumstances of homosexuality. At this point, the bishop offered his resignation to the Pope, should he feel it necessary to remove him; no such action was taken however. <ref>ibid.</ref>

Toward late 1989 he attempted concillatory movements, signing an agreement in which he promised "loyalty" and "docility" to the pope. This agreement did not last long however; within a week, Gaillot had distanced himself from the majority of other bishops by appearing on television to criticise the "feeble state of internal debate in the church" and express his feelings of grief that progress had not been made since the Second Vatican Council.<ref>Commonweal. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1252/is_n17_v122/ai_17564085/pg_1 Provocateur or prophet? The French church & Bishop Gaillot pg.4] 6 October, 1995</ref>

In 1991, he opposed the Gulf War, publishing a book called ''Open letter to those who preach war, but let it be waged by others''. He also condemned the embargo on Iraq. By the end of 1991 the French Bishops' Conference had censured Gaillot three times, most recently for his intervention in Haiti, rousing support for Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

Bishop Gaillot also caused controversy with a number of other actions. He was frequently condemned by others for his numerous television appearances, but justified them by claiming that if people still found a Bishop interesting, then they clearly still found the church interesting. thumb|240px|Cover of one of Bishop Gaillot's books

As well as this Bishop Gaillot also took a lenient stance with regard to abortion, claiming he was not qualified to judge a woman who found herself in such a scenario.

By 1994, Archbishop Joseph Duval of Rouen, the President of the French Bishops' Conference was attempting to convince Gaillot to cease in his actions; Gaillot however responded by withdrawing his offer of resignation, desiring that the scenario not be reduced to the same response given by the Vatican in the case of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen.

At the height of the controversy that Bishop Gaillot caused during his tenure as Ordinary of Évreux he was the target of a bitter campaign to disparge his name. Unsubstantiated allegations of homosexuality, racism, anti-Semitism, and psychosis and neurosis were all made by highly placed authorities in the French clergy. <ref>Commonweal.

He branded Archbishop Duval an "ayatollah" seeking to impose "ideological uniformity" within the French Bishops' Conference. Further, he also compared the leadership style of Cardinal Gantin to those of the East German political police the Stasi. <ref>Commonweal.

Testament to Gaillot's strong yearning to reach out to the 'exiled' is the fact that by the time he left office at the Diocese of Évreux he had visited more prisons than any bishop in France's history.

==Removal from Évreux==
On January 13 1995, Jacques Gaillot was summoned to a meeting with Bernardin Cardinal Gantin, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops  at the Vatican City. He was offered the choice of resigning his see and become emeritus bishop of Évreux, or being removed from the see. In that case, he would be assigned to the titular see of Partenia. Gaillot chose not to resign; instead, he left the Vatican and returned to France to give a press conference, providing one short press release to explain the events:

{{Quotation|Cardinal Gantin, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, summoned me to be in Rome on January 12, 1995 at 9:30 am.
The threats that were hanging over me for a while came into effect. I had met the deadline. I was told that I had been removed from my function as bishop and that the See of Évreux would be declared vacant starting tomorrow from noon onwards.
I was asked to hand in my resignation, which I thought I had good reasons to refuse.

'''Jacques Jean Edmond Georges Gaillot''' (* Vatikan und seiner Amtsenthebung ist er seit 1995 Titularbischof von Partenia und Internetseelsorger.

== Leben ==
=== Anfänge und Bischofsweihe ===
Gaillot wurde am 11. September 1935 in Saint-Dezier in der südlichen Champagne als Sohn einer Weinhändlerfamilie geboren und besuchte nach der Mittelschule das Priesterseminar von Langres. Von 1957 bis 1959 leistete er in Algerien den Militärdienst, der ihn mit der Gewalt des Krieges konfrontierte. Diese Erfahrung weckte in ihm die Bereitschaft zur Gewaltlosigkeit. Die Entdeckung der islamischen Welt rief eine tiefe Freundschaft mit den Algeriern hervor. <!-- Die sich WIE äußerte? -->

Von 1960 bis 1962 hielt er sich zum erweiterten Theolgiestudium in Rom auf, um das Zweiten Vatikanischen Konzils.

1973 erfolgte in seiner Heimatstadt Saint-Dizier die Ernennung zum Pfarrer; gleichzeitig trägt er Mitverantwortung für die Schulung der Priesterausbilder in Paris am Institut de formation des éducateurs du clergé (IFEC). 1977 wurde er Generalvikar der Diözese von Langres, 1981 wurde er zum Kapitularvikar gewählt und am 5. Mai 1982 erfolgte die Ernennung zum Bischof von Évreux. Die Weihe vollzog am 20. Juni 1982 der Bischof von Langres, Léon Aimé Taverdet, assistiert von den Konsekratoren Jean-Félix-Albert-Marie Vilnet, Bischof von Lille, und Erzbischof Joseph Marie Louis Duval von Rouen.

===Konflikte===

Er setzte sich öffentlich für verschiedene Personen und Themen ein:
* 1983 unterstützte er in Évreux vor Gericht einen jungen Mann, der den Militärdienst aus Gewissensgründen verweigert hatte. 
* Auf der Jahresversammlung der französischen Bischöfe im Oktober 1983 stimmte er zusammen mit einem anderen Bischof gegen einen Text des Episkopats zur nuklearen Abschreckung. 
* 1985 sympathisierte er mit dem palästinensischen Aufstand in den von Israel besetzten Gebieten und trifft den Palästinenserführer Yassir Arafat in Tunis. 
* Er nimmt an einer außerordentlichen Sitzung der UNO zum Thema Abrüstung teil. 
* Im Juli 1987 besucht er in Südafrika einen jungen Antiapartheitsaktivisten aus Évreux, der vom Regime in Pretoria zu vier Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt worden ist.
* Im November 1988 tritt er im Wallfahrtsort Lourdes auf einer Vollversammlung der französischen Bischöfe insgeheim für die Priesterweihe verheirateter Männer ein. 
* Im Oktober 1989 setzt er sich auf einer Reise der Friedensbewegung in Französisch-Polynesien für den Stopp der Atomwaffenversuche ein. 
* 1991 erscheint sein Buch „Offener Brief an diejenigen, die den Krieg predigen, diesen aber andere führen lassen“ als Ablehnung des Golfkriegs und der Wirtschaftsblockade gegen den Irak. 
* Er führte eine dreijährige Synode durch und schrieb etwa ein Dutzend Bücher. Das Buch „Coup de gueule contre l'exclusion“ (Protestschrei gegen den Ausschluss) erregte als scharfe Kritik der Einwanderungsgesetze des damaligen Innenministers Charles Pasqua besonderes Aufsehen und wurde später vom Vatikan als Hauptgrund für seine Absetzung genannt.

===Seit der Absetzung===
Am 13. Januar 1995 wurde Gaillot unter anderem angeblich auf Druck der französischen Regierung, insbesondere des Innenministers Charles Pasqua, von Papst Johannes Paul II. als Bischof von Évreux abgelöst und auf den Titularsitz von Partenia versetzt. Bischof Gaillot ließ die im 5. Jahrhundert untergegangene Diözese als „Diözese ohne Grenzen“ im Internet wiederaufleben. Mit Hilfe der modernen Kommunikationsmittel kommuniziert er von seinen Klosterräumen in Paris aus über das Internet mit Menschen in aller Welt.

Er arbeitet in Paris für Ausländer, die keine gültigen Aufenthaltspapiere besitzen, und für obdachlose Familien sowie für junge Arbeitslose.

Anlässlich der Einladung zu einer ökumenischen Begegnung mit den Bischöfen im Mai 2000 schreibt der Präsident der französischen Bischofskonferenz in einem offenen Brief an Gaillot: „Es ist wichtig, dass die Katholiken und auch die Öffentlichkeit im Allgemeinen wissen, dass uns sehr wohl ein brüderliches Band vereint, wenn diese Verbundenheit auch auf besondere Art gelebt wird.“
