'''Coffs Harbour''' ist eine Küstenstadt im Norden des australischen Bundesstaates lokalen Verwaltungsgebiets Coffs Harbour City.

Die Umgebung von Coffs Harbour wird dominiert von Resorts und Bananenplantagen und Farmen.

Der Name ''Coffs Harbour'' lässt sich auf Captain John Korff zurückführen, der die Gegend ''Korff's Harbour'' nannte, als er 1847 Schutz vor einem Unwetter suchte.

Coffs Harbour ist der Mittelpunkt einer gedeihenden Bananenindustrie. Eine der größten Attraktionen ist die ''Big Banana'', die größte Banane der Welt (aus Beton) als Symbol des bekanntesten Exportgutes der Region, innerhalb der man mehr über den Bananenanbau erfahren kann. Zudem existiert ein beliebtes Tauchzentrum in einem kleinen natürlichen Riff.

Weitere Sehenswürdigkeiten sind der Tierpark Pet Porpoise Pool (Delphin- und Seehundshow), das Historical Museum (Bilder, Werkzeuge und Erinnerungsstücke aus der Pionierzeit) und der Botanische Garten am Ufer des Coffs Creek mit Pflanzen aus subtropischen und gemäßigten Zonen.

Die Stadt beherbergt den ''Coffs Harbour Education Campus'', eine Partnerschaft zwischen der Southern Cross University und dem Coffs Harbour Senior College.

'''Coffs Harbour''', or simply ''Coffs'', is a local government area.  It is a popular Pacific Highway.

Coffs Harbour is also a well known surfing spot, with regional competitions and a large surfing community within the Coffs Harbour Area. 

== Geography ==
The greater Coffs Harbour city is broken up into several suburb and precinct areas including:
*Boambee
*Coffs Harbour City Centre (City Centre)
*Coffs Harbour Jetty (Jetty)
*Diggers Beach
*Korora
*Moonee Beach
*Park Beach
*Red Hill
*South Coffs
*West Coffs
*West Korora
*Sapphire Beach

The city is surrounded by outlying towns that have established themselves and are often referred to as suburbs of the Coffs Coast Region: 
*Bellingen
*Coramba
*Nana Glen
*Corindi/Red Rock
*Dorrigo
*Sawtell (Including Toormina and East Boambee)
*Woolgoolga

Sawtell, 10 km south along Hogbin Drive from the city has become a little brother town, where it was often regarded as a suburb of the city. 

Coffs Harbour is also one of many regional cities along the Pacific Highway between Newcastle and The Gold Coast.
The city's close proximity to the centre of the mid and north coasts makes it a comfortable drive from either end of the highway. Some of the regional cities that scatter the highway include Tweed Heads, Ballina, Grafton, Kempsey, Port Macquarie and Taree.

The surrounding region is dominated by coastal resorts and apartments with hinterland hills and mountains covered by forests, banana plantations, and other farms. It is the only place in Australia where the Great Dividing Range meets the Pacific Ocean.

== Name ==
Coffs Harbour owes its name to Daniel Hack, formerly of the Gold Coast, who named the area ''Korff's Harbour'' when he was forced to take shelter from storm in the area in 1847. Its name was accidentally changed by the surveyor for the crown when he reserved land in the area during 1861.

== Attractions ==
Coffs Harbour is the hub for a thriving banana industry. One of the biggest attractions is the Big Banana, the first of Australia's Big Things (it celebrated its 40th Birthday in 2005), with the World's Largest Banana celebrating the region's best known export. There is also a popular underwater diving spot on a small natural reef.

The Coffs Harbour Jetty is an historically important timber wharf where coastal shipping once moved the timber from the hinterland. The Jetty area is the subject of current planning by Council and consultants to develop a cultural precinct and rejuvenated residential area.

Nearby the Solitary Islands Marine Park preserves a diverse underwater ecosystem that mirrors the terrestrial biodiversity, covering the southern limit of northern tropical species and the northern limits of the southern temperate species. Directly out to breakwater is Muttonbird Island. The island is a nature reserve protecting a significant Wedge-tailed Shearwater breeding site.

There are many National Parks, Reserves and Marine Parks surrounding the city, including:
* Bellinger River National Park (west of Bellingen in the Bellinger headwaters)
* Bindarri National Park (20km west of the city, near Ulong and Dairyville)
*Bongil Bongil National Park (south of Sawtell)
*Cascade National Park (north of Dorrigo)
*Coffs Coast Regional Park (beachside reserves and parks along the Coffs Coast)
*Dorrigo National Park (just south of the Dorrigo township)
*Junuy Juluum National Park (north of Dorrigo)
*Moonee Beach Nature Reserve (Moonee Beach-Emerald Beach)
*Nymboi-Binderay National Park (north of Dorrigo, east of Glenreigh, on the Nymboida River)
*Solitary Islands Marine Park (in the Tasman Sea from Coffs Harbour to Wooli)
*Ulidarra National Park (Bruxner Park and Mount Coramba area)
*Yuraygir National Park (stretching from Yamba to Red Rock and west along the Coast Range)

The town's water supply comes from the nearby Orara River at Cochranes Pool and the city hosts the Coffs Harbour Regional Botanic Garden.

== Education ==

Coffs Harbour is home to the Coffs Harbour Education Campus (CHEC), a unique concept which is a partnership between the Orara, Coffs Harbour (Jetty), Toormina, John Paul College, Coffs Harbour Christian Community and Bishop Druitt College.

== Bypass ==
Although the Pacific Highway cuts through the centre of the city, much attention has recently been focused on obtaining state government commitment to determining the routes of proposed highway deviations at a number of places including Bonville, the North Boambee Valley to the west of Coffs Harbour and north of Arrawarra to Wells Crossing.
