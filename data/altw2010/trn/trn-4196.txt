'''''AfterMASH''''' var en situasjonskomedie som ble sendt på M*A*S*H. Handlingen var lagt til et landsens sykehus etter Oberst Sherman Potter (Max Klinger (Fader Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher). Dette var samtidig de tre skuespillerne som hadde stemt mot at TV-serien skulle legges ned. M*A*S*H-produsentene valgte da å lage en ny serie der de tre var med. Første sesong var en suksess med 15. plass over mest sette serie. Utover i sesong to dalte imidlertid interessen helt til en valgte å legge ned serien. Siste episode ble aldri vist.

==Synopsis==
I første episode kommer oberst Sherman Potter hjem fra Korea til sin kone Mildred. Han mistrives med å være pensjonist, så han tar en jobb som personalsjef på General Pershing veteransykehus (kalt for «General General»). Max Klinger kom i konflikt med loven hjemme i Toledo, og ble heller ikke likt av sin familie for å ha giftet seg med en koreaner. De klarte ikke å finne seg en leilighet fordi utleierne ikke ville ha et blandet ektepar som leietakere så til slutt kontakter han Potter som ansetter han som sin assistent. Fader Mulcahy får sin hørsel skadet i siste episode av ''M*A*S*H'' og lider av depresjoner og alkoholisme. Han får sin hørsel kirurgisk korrigert, slutter å drikke og blir med Potter og Klinger i sykehusets stab som prest.

==Format==
''AfterMASH'' utnyttet forbindelsen til M*A*S*H når det var mulig. Noen ganger tok dette form av lån av ideer som da Klinger redekorerte Potters kontor slik at det så ut som det han hadde i Korea. Generelt sett forsøkte en med ''AfterMASH'' å skape den samme dramatiske strukturen som i originalen. Fordi handlingen ble lagt til et sykehus for veteraner var mange av episodene knyttet til krigens redsler og gru, omtrent som nesten hver episode i siste sesong av ''M*A*S*H''.

Mange av karakterne i ''M*A*S*H'' hadde tilsvarende karakterer i ''AfterMASH''. Hawkeye Pierce sitt alter ego ble en problemskapende, men idealistisk og talentfull ung kirurg, Gene Pfeiffer (Jay O. Sanders), som for øvrig ble erstattet i andre sesong. Frank Burns og Margaret Houlihan sine roller som halvintelligente, byråkratiske og autoritære figurer ble på sykehuset fylt av admistrasjonssjef Mike D'Angelo (John Chappell) og hans assistent Alma Cox (Brandis Kemp). Men den nye serien klarte ikke å gjenskape den originale følelsen. Serien var over etter 30 episoder.

'''''AfterMASH''''' was an American spin-off of the long-running hit series ''M*A*S*H'' (the name is a aftermath''), the show took place immediately following the end of the Colonel Potter (played by Father Mulcahy (played by William Christopher). Morgan, Farr, and Christopher had voted in the minority when the cast of ''M*A*S*H'' elected not to continue the original series. 

''AfterMASH'' premiered in the fall of 1983 in the same Monday night 9:00 P.M. EST. time slot as its predecessor ''M*A*S*H''. It finished a very respectable number 15 out of all network shows for the 1983-1984 season according to Mr. T's signature mohawk. The none-too-subtle implication was that ''AfterMASH'' would trounce the ''A-Team'' in the ratings. But history was to have the final judgment &mdash; the ''A-Team'' continued until 1987, long after ''AfterMASH'' had become a distant memory. ''AfterMASH'' is now chiefly mentioned in discussions of unsuccessful spinoffs.

==Synopsis==
In the one-hour pilot episode "September of '53/Together Again", Colonel Potter returned home from depression and drinking heavily. Potter arranged for Mulcahy to receive an operation at another VA Hospital in St. Louis. After his hearing was surgically corrected, he stopped drinking and joined Potter and Klinger at the veteran's hospital as the chaplain. Also on hand was the idealistic and talented young surgeon Gene Pfeffier (Jay O. Sanders), attractive secretary Bonnie Hornbeck (Wendy Schall), who had an eye for Klinger, and old-timer Bob Scannell (Patrick Cranshaw) who served with Potter in World War II and was now a hospital resident of 35 years (thanks to his exposure to mustard gas). There was also a home scene with the Potters, most notably when they were deluged with guests in "Thanksgiving of '53", and Potter tried to keep the phone occupied so Klinger couldn't call his parents, who were on the way over to surprise him. Possibly the best episode of the season was the Emmy-nominated "Fall Out", where Potter and Pfeiffer considered leaving General General, but reconsidered when they linked the leukemia seen in a patient with exposure to atomic testing. The season closed in March with Klinger being arrested for decking a shady real estate agent as pregnant Soon Lee went into labor. In May, CBS announced the show was renewed for a second season.  

Season Two opened with Klinger escaping from the River Bend County Jail to attend the birth of his child and remaining a fugitive until a judge sent him to the psychiatric unit at General General, where Klinger feigned insanity to avoid prison and the Potters took in Soon Lee and the (as yet unnamed) baby. Mike D'Angelo was transferred to Montana and was replaced by smarmy new administrator Wally Wainwright (Peter Michael Goetz). Anne Pitoniak was brought in to replace Barbara Townsend as Mildred Potter. Dr. Pfeffier was phased out late in the first season and replaced by Dr. Boyer (David Ackroyd), had who lost a leg in Korea and whose bitterness was only matched by his excellent surgical skills.  An attractive new psychiatrist, Dr. Lenore Dudziak (Wendy Girard) arrived to begin the daunting task of evaluating Klinger, while Potter was horrified that Wainwright assigned Alma Cox as his new secretary.

The only other main character from the original series to appear on ''AfterMASH'' was Radar (played by pilot called ''St. Louis and became a Colonel Flagg (played by Edward Winter) appeared in the second season, now working for the CIA and only too eager to testify against Klinger in "Trials". Character actors Arliss Howard, Timothy Busfield, William Sadler, and David Graf all appeared as patients.
