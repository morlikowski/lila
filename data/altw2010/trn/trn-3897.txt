'''''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back''''' er en komedie fra Oxycontinmisbruket sitt. Filmen er også en gavepakke til Smiths fans, med en mengde referanser til tidligere filmer og cameoroller fra Smiths skuespillervenner. 

Filmen fikk en R-rating i USA på grunn av dens drøye språkbruk, samt holdninget til sex, vold og narkotika.

==Handling==
Jay og Silent oppdager at Miramax Films skal lage en film basert på tegneserien Bluntman & Chronic, en tegneserie som er basert på de. De oppdager også internett, og at filmen blir kritisert av filmfan. De bestemmer seg for å dra til Hollywood for å stoppe svertingen av nevnene deres, eller i alle fall få pengene de mener de har krav på.

Underveis støter de på en dyreverngruppe kalt K.L.I.T.T. som de haiker med, bestående av fire kvinner og en mann, på vei for å frigjøre en orangutang fra et dyretestingslaboratorium. Men organisasjonen er bare en falsk front, egentlig er de fire kvinnene en smykketyvliga og mannen bare et offerlam. Jay får kastet ut mannen etter at han lurer han til å si at han kunne tenke seg sex med en sau, for å komme nærmere Justice, en av jentene Jay forelsker seg i.

Jay og Silent Bob blir latt i stikken og får skylden for innbruddet. Sammen med orangutangen fra labben drar de videre til Hollywood med viltdyrsmarshallen Willenholly i hælene...

'''''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back''''' (2001) is a film written by, directed by and starring Kevin Smith, the fifth to be set in his two title characters, portrayed by Smith.

The title and logo for ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' are direct references to the second-released The Empire Strikes Back''.

Smith originally intended this to be the last film to utilize his View Askewniverse, or feature Jay and Silent Bob.  Five years later Smith changed his mind and decided to close out the series with ''Clerks II'', resurrecting Jay and Silent Bob in supporting roles. In the end credits for that film it states the two might return someday. 

== Plot ==
Jay (Kevin Smith) find out that Bluntman and Chronic, the comic book based on their likenesses, has been adapted into a film in production by Miramax Films.  Upon learning of the movie, as well as the negative reaction the movie has received so far on the internet, the two set out on a quest to Hollywood, to prevent the movie from being made and tainting their "good name", or at the very least "get [their] motherfucking movie check" from the royalties due them.

On the way, they befriend an animal liberation group, consisting of four women and one man they picked up for the cause.  It is revealed that the organization is a front; the man (Seann William Scott) is a patsy, intended as a diversion by freeing an orangutan from an animal testing laboratory while the girls rob a diamond depository nearby.  Jay cons the man into embarrassing himself in order to get closer to Justice (Shannon Elizabeth), the most compassionate of the women and the one with whom he finds himself smitten.

Jay and Bob now must stand in as the patsies. A wildlife field marshal arrives named Marshall Willenholly (Will Ferrell). Blinded to the diamond heist, Willenholly chases them as they make their way to Hollywood with the orangutan.

While the girls are robbing the diamond depository they accidentally set off the alarm, prompting them to break the glass and steal the diamonds.  While this is going on Jay and Silent Bob free the animals only to escape outside and have the police show up and witness the girls' van blowing up, believing them to be inside of it during the explosion.  

Jay then takes the orangutan with him as a memorial to Justice.  Quickly afterwards Federal Wildlife Marshall Willenholly shows up at the scene, claiming to have jurisdiction because "somebody let out all these animals".  He is informed that all the animals have been recovered except for an orangutan, which he claims to be "the most dangerous animal known to man".

Confronting Jay and Silent Bob at a diner and issuing a threat to open fire, Jay and Silent Bob dress the orangutan as a child and walk out, claiming it to be their "love child" and threatening to go back to their liberal-minded city with tales of prejudice and bigotry from Utah.  Marshal Willenholly thinks about the political repercussions and lets them go, to the amazement of the sheriff.

Realizing the child to be the orangutan in disguise, the officers quickly chase them into a sewer system, where both Jay and Silent Bob, as well as Marshal Willenholly arrive at a fall off point of a giant dam.  The orangutan grabs Jay and Silent Bob and pulls them down.  Marshal Willenholly amazed at how far down a fall it is decides to follow them by jumping off, only to realize going down that the orangutan (Suzanne) is hanging on a pipe extruding from the dam while holding Jay and Silent Bob.

Escaping the law, Jay and Silent Bob once again return to their quest to reach Hollywood only to have Suzanne taken by a Hollywood animal acting agency car.  Now on a quest to get their ape back and to clear their names, the two once again embark to Hollywood.

Arriving in Hollywood the two find themselves in the background of a news cast (ironically about their kidnapping Suzanne) that Justice is watching.  While Justice takes the diamonds and goes to Hollywood to set things right, Marshal Willenholly learns of their mission to reach Hollywood and leaves to find them.

After a long chase with Studio Security and reclaiming Suzanne, Jay and Silent Bob end up in American Pie portrayed by Shannon Elizabeth).  Suzanne beats both of them up effortlessly and Jay and Silent Bob assume the roles of their characters, Bluntman and Chronic.  Being forced into their costumes and thrown on stage, they must engage in a duel with Cock-Knocker (Mark Hamill), eventually taking a break from the scene when Willenholly interrupts to capture Jay and Silent Bob.  During this final scene, Justice and her former jewel thief team arrive, and a climactic final battle ensues, after which Jay and Silent Bob get their royalties to the film, and Justice turns herself and her former team in to Willenholly in exchange for a shorter sentence and letting Jay and Silent Bob go.

The film ends with Jay and Silent Bob spending their royalty money on finding everybody who expressed negative opinions about the movie and characters, ranging from kids to clergy, and traveling to their town to beat them up, followed by Jay and Silent Bob with most of the cast enjoying a performance from The Time.
