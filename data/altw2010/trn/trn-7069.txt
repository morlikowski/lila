'''Kyrill''' () is the name given to a Newfoundland on German and Dutch coasts on the afternoon of 18 January, before moving eastwards toward Poland and the Baltic Sea on the night from January 18 to January 19 and further on to northern Russia.

Kyrill caused widespread damage across Western Europe, especially in the United Kingdom and Germany. 47 fatalities have been reported as of January 19 as well as extensive disruptions of public transport, power outages to over one hundred thousand homes, severe damages to public and private buildings and major forest damage through windthrow.

The storm was named "Kyrill" on Bulgarian man living near Berlin, whose family donated to the university's "Adopt-A-Vortex"<ref>http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/adopt-a-vortex/historie/</ref> programme.<ref></ref>

== Abstract ==
A Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, and Poland. As these storms can generate hurricane-force winds (and sometimes even winds at the strength of major hurricanes), they are sometimes referred to as hurricanes, even though few originate as tropical cyclones.

These storms rank as the second highest cause of global natural catastrophe insurance loss (after U.S. hurricanes).

Kyrill was unusual in that its field of hurricane-force winds was very broad, affecting large areas of Germany as well as neighbouring countries at one time. Kyrill brought wind gusts of up to 130&nbsp;km/h (80&nbsp;mph) even in the North German plains. German weather experts have described the storm as a "once in a decade" event.

The last storm to affect Germany on a similar scale was Lothar, which hit in 1999.

== Events ==
After making landfall in Ireland and the UK in the late hours of January 17, the storm swept across Ireland and Great Britain on the night of 17 to 18 January, with winds of 160&nbsp;km/h (99&nbsp;mph) at The Needles, 149&nbsp;km/h (93&nbsp;mph) recorded in Dublin, 130&nbsp;km/h (81&nbsp;mph) recorded at Aberdaron on the Llyn peninsula, 122&nbsp;km/h (76&nbsp;mph) at Mumbles near Swansea and winds of 101&nbsp;km/h (63&nbsp;mph) at St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan. 
The German Meteorological Service had advised people to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary trips on 18 January,<ref> </ref> and wind strengths of up to 12 on the Bremen, Sněžka in the Krkonoše mountains, where wind gusts reached 212&nbsp;km/h (132&nbsp;mph).<ref> </ref> In the Czech Republic winds as high as 200&nbsp;km/h disrupted both rail and air traffic; record high temperatures reached 14 °C (57 °F) in Prague.<ref></ref>

== Effects of the storm ==

On the day of the landfall, an approximate 25,000 homes in southern England were without electricity after electricity pylons were damaged by the storm.<ref></ref> Same day, the German states of Brandenburg, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt were hit by a massive power cut. 52,000 homes were without energy, according to local utility ''envia''.<ref name="SPON-TICKER"> </ref> The German district Siegen-Wittgenstein had issued a state of emergency, with schools remaining closed on Friday, January 19, and roads not to be cleared right away, but closed instead until the situation improved.<ref> </ref> By the second day of the storm, more than one million homes were left without power in the Czech republic with another million households without electricity in Germany and tens of thousands dark homes in Austria and Poland.<ref name="Czech-damage"></ref><ref name="power-outages">{{cite web|url=

In Poland, a flood alarm was issued in several localities due to large rainfalls and the storm damaged several houses in the region of Jelenia Góra.<ref>
</ref> In Ukraine, the supply of oil through the Druzhba pipeline came to a complete halt as a result of the storm.<ref></ref>
Strong winds over the Alps became foehn wind and caused unseasonally high temperatures in Italy (up to 25 °C/77 °F in Turin).<ref>[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/LIMF/2007/1/19/DailyHistory.html History for Torino, Italy]. ''Weather Underground''. 2007-01-19. Last accessed 2007-01-22.</ref>

In Ireland thousands of homes were left without power and heavy downpours caused flash flooding.

In the Netherlands, the storm flood warning system (''Stormvloedwaarschuwingsdienst'') was activated, as the approaching storm was measured in excess of 10 Beaufort. Alarms were issued to two northern regions, Harlingen, at approximately 22:30 CET on Thursday 18 January. The water level peaked in the early hours of Friday, almost 4.5 m above the astronomical prediction level, and an ''en masse'' evacuation of the two cities was narrowly avoided.

High winds in the Alps prompted the Austrian weather service to advise the skiers and snowboarders to seek shelter, and caused at least one major motorway tunnel closure.<ref name="alps"></ref>

The cost of the damage across Europe to the insurance industry has been estimated by Swiss Re as €3.5bn.<ref></ref> In the UK, the cost to the insurance industry could be as high as £350m (€520m).<ref></ref> As the event is relatively recent for the insurance industry these are unlikely to be the final costs.

===Notable buildings===
Several windows were smashed into at the Roman mosaic dating to the 3rd century. The Römisch-Germanisches Museum building was originally constructed around the mosaic. As of January 2007, it is still unclear whether the actual mosaic has suffered damage, as museum staff have announced the cleanup will at least take a week due to the fragility of the exhibit.<ref></ref> Museum manager Bernhard Ostermann estimated that the mosaic was damaged in 100 to 150 places<ref></ref>

The chapel of Wittenberg Castle in Wittenberg, Germany, which is a World Heritage Site, lost several of its sandstone merlons. They broke off during the storm, damaging several stained-glass windows in their fall.

===Harbours and shipping===

The rescue services. The ship was later pulled to shelter in Lyme Bay and was being towed to Portland Harbour in Dorset. The ship is reported to have suffered structural damage, including a 1 m by 0.5 m (3&nbsp;ft by 1&nbsp;ft 6 in) hole on the starboard side and water flooding and has been beached 1&nbsp;mile off the East Devon coast at Branscombe<ref name="BBC-6277651"></ref> An anti-pollution operation started on January 21 after the ship leaked up to 200 tonnes of oil. Some 200 containers have also been reported missing, among them one that contains battery acid and several others with dangerous goods of various kind.<ref name="BBC-6283965"></ref>

The East Frisian and North Frisian islands.<ref></ref>
In Ireland, high tide had set in, so there was less damage than expected.

The Cypriot-flagged freighter ''Golden Sky'', carrying a load of fertilizer and fuel oil, ran aground near Ventspils, off the coast of Latvia; the ship's crew were rescued in a joint Latvian and Swedish operation.<ref> </ref><ref></ref>

=== Road transport ===

Many countries suffered from road and M1, M6 and M18 were closed in several places, as well as the M25 ring road around London and a number of other motorways. Bridges including the M6 Thelwall Viaduct and the M25 Dartford Crossing were closed due to high winds. Closures were largely due to the toppling of multiple high-sided vehicles. Other motorways were affected by significant delays. Long queues developed around blackspots, in particular replacement crossings of the Manchester Ship Canal including routes through Warrington and over the Runcorn Bridge.<ref></ref>
In Germany, a number of motorways, especially those with bridges over the Rhine or those with valley bridges, also faced closures due to high winds.
The Dutch police advised drivers of empty lorries not to enter the Netherlands. Many roads were also closed in Ireland due to fallen trees and overturned lorries.

===Air transport===
thumb|right|Destroyed [[AN-2s at Jelenia Góra local airport.]]
More than 280 flights were cancelled at Heathrow airport, and 80 more flights were cancelled due to health and safety reasons at Manchester Airport.<ref name="bloomberg1"></ref> Many flights were delayed at Ireland's airports on the morning of 19 January due to the high winds in Ireland, however by afternoon they were delayed because of high winds elsewhere in Europe.
Several flights at Frankfurt International Airport were cancelled due to the bad weather.<ref name="SPON-460538"> </ref>
Overall, during January 18 and 19 Swiss International Air Lines announced the cancellation of at least 88 flights, British Airways canceled 180 flights and Lufthansa cut 329 flights and warned of more delays before the service began to return back to normal.<ref name="bloomberg2"></ref>

The storm seriously affected the Cardiff and London Paddington had to be cancelled, and the East Coast Mainline was operating on a reduced timetable. Virgin Trains cancelled its services from London to Scotland, whilst First Great Western closed the line between Paddington and Reading, Berkshire, running a replacement bus service.
