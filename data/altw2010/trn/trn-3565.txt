'''John Ro Myung''' () (born on January 24, 1967 in Chicago, Illinois) is a bassist and a founding member of the progressive metal group Dream Theater. 	

== Background ==
Born in Kings Park, electric bass in a local band when he was fifteen.  After graduating from high school he and his high school friend Chris Collins.  The band would later change its name to Dream Theater. 	 
	 
Though Dream Theater is his primary focus musically, he has appeared in a number of other projects through his career.  His first non-Dream Theater venture was in the pop-prog band Platypus with Rod Morgenstein, Ty Tabor and ex-Dream Theater bandmate Derek Sherinian.  He is also a member of The Jelly Jam, which consists of the same line-up as Platypus, but without Sherinian.  Apart from his membership in these bands, he has appeared as a guest on numerous records.

Myung's main influences include Steve Harris, Yes, Rush, and Metallica. 	 

John is married to Lisa Martens Pace, the bass player in the defunct all-female heavy metal band Meanstreak.  Two other members of the band, Rena Sands and Marlene Apuzzo are married to Dream Theater members: John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy, respectively.

John is a Christian and open about his religion in interviews - Jordan Rudess confirmed this in a post on his forum. <ref name="dtfaq3">[http://faq.dtnorway.com/question/114 faq.dtnorway.com | Are the band members religious?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Personality==
Myung has a reputation as the 'spooky' member of Dream Theater, as he is very quiet (particularly in comparison to bandmate Mike Portnoy) and seldom draws attention to himself in videos or concerts.  This has led some fans jokingly to wonder if anyone has ever seen him speak. (Of course, he does speak in DVD commentaries and, obviously, on his instructional video, as well as to fans he meets at live shows.  If given the right topic, such as bass playing techniques, he will converse for long periods of time.) <ref name="dtfaq1">[http://faq.dtnorway.com/question/33 faq.dtnorway.com | Does John M speak?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His mysterious persona was emphasized when, at a show in tackled Dream Theater singer James LaBrie, much to the confusion and amazement of both the audience and the rest of the band; this move later became known as the "Myung Tackle."  It would later be revealed in the band's biography ''Lifting Shadows'' that he was dared to do it with "a couple hundred dollars and nobody thought that he would do it."<ref>{{cite book

Myung is also famous for his practicing principles.  Both Kevin Shirley (on the Metropolis 2000: Scenes From New York DVD) as well as former keyboardist Derek Sherinian (on his website <ref name="sherinian">[http://www.dereksherinian.com/bio-arthist_bass.html Untitled Document<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>) have said that Myung is the only musician they know who warms '''down''' after a show.  In a forum post, John Petrucci said that, when he and Myung were at Berklee, the two had an agreement to practice at least six hours every day. <ref name="petrucci"></ref>

==Songwriting==
Dream Theater has long been known for its group writing process, so it is sometimes difficult to identify which member of the band authored a particular song or song section (although, on some DVD commentaries, the band members have identified certain parts as, e.g., "a John Myung riff").  With respect to lyrics, Myung wrote the lyrics to at least one song per album from "Images and Words" to "Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory."  Since the release of "Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence," however, Myung has not contributed any lyrics.  Mike Portnoy once commented in a chat session that this is probably because Myung's lyrics usually needed some work by the rest of the band to fit to the song.  As a result, the band eventually imposed an unwritten lyric rule that required lyrics to be "properly formed, phrased, constructed, etc. to go with the melodies," and, "since then, John has kind of backed off." <ref name="dtfaq4">[http://www.dtfaq.com/question/1058 dtfaq.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Equipment== 
Myung began playing bass at the age of 15 after having played violin for a number of years.  His first bass was a "Memphis" brand Precision bass copy, but he quickly upgraded to a salmon-colored four-string Fender Jazz bass.  He also began to develop a unique playing style high on the neck, adding counterpoint lines and melodies to the band's material which are not typically heard in traditional "rock" music. He was also a heavy user of effects not typically heard on the bass guitar to better bring out his distinctive style. 

For Dream Theater's debut album "When Dream and Day Unite," Myung played a heavily-modified Ernie Ball/MusicMan Stingray four-string bass, as well as his four-string Fender Jazz Bass, with the Stingray seeing the vast majority of local New York City-area live performances in this period (1988-1992).  The Ernie Ball/MusicMan Stingray four-string was customized with an added front pickup sending a traditional clean bass sound to a clean amp, while the bridge signal was sent to a full-time "effected" amplifier, much like his influences Chris Squire and Geddy Lee). 

Myung used a 4-string Spector [http://www.spectorbass.com/images/ns2goldenstainlrg.jpg NS-2] for most of the recording of "Images and Words" in 1992 (although he may have used a 5-string or 6-string bass for songs such as "Take the Time," which features a low-C#).  He made the technically challenging switch to 6-string basses for Dream Theater's subsequent tour of America, Europe, and Japan, using several high-end Tobias "Basic" basses.  At least two, a red-stained and "cherry sunburst" can be seen and heard on various Dream Theater music videos and on the "Live At The Marquee" EP released in 1993.  Myung continued to use Tobias basses throughout the "Images And Tour" and "Music In Progress" tours from 1992 to late 1993. 

For Dream Theater's "Awake" album, Myung became the primary endorser of Tung basses, which were produced by a small company formed by ex-Tobias luthier Nicholas Tung.  Myung owned at least three of the only 100 instruments constructed, two "Wingbass II Bolt-on" six-strings (one natural and one sunburst, both with maple tops, ash bodies and maple necks with rosewood fretboards), and one "Wingbass II Hybrid (a "half neck-through" with spalted maple top, ash body, and maple neck and fretboard).  The natural-finish Wingbass II bolt-on became his main live instrument for the "Waking Up The World" and "Hamer acoustic bass for "unplugged" radio shows and live performances.  For amplification, he was using Mesa Boogie Strategy 400 power amps, a Mesa Boogie Bass 400+, and a modified Mesa Boogie Triaxis guitar preamp with several transistors swapped out for ones that would support the lower range of a bass guitar.
