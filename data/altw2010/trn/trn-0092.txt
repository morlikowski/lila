During the following years, the team failed completely during the 1997 European Championships and Goedkoop took his leave in the spring of 1998. His successor Pierre Mathieu performed reasonably during the World Championships (7th position) and sober during the European Championships (5th position). In 2000 The Netherlands failed to qualify for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia during the qualification tournament in Japan.

Italian women's team, was selected as national coach in 2001. During the qualification tournament in Den Bosch, the team gained a ticket to the 2002 World Championships in Germany. There the national side reached the fifth place. 

In August the 2003 European Championships started in Turkey, where the team ended fourth. The Netherlands managed to defeat Italy, Czech Republic, Bulgaria an Ukraine, but lost their matches against Poland, Turkey and Germany. 

In preparation for the next tournament, the FIVB World Grand Prix, the Dutch team played four friendly matches against Italy. The women first met Japan in the pool round during the Grand Prix, which resulted in a 3-0 victory. They also won the three following pool matches against Italy (3-2), Cuba (3-2) and Germany (3-2). They ended second in their pool, behind the USA. In the final round Italy was the first opponent.

The Dutch team lost the semi-final to Turkey (0-3), followed by a defeat in the bronze medal match against Germany (2-3).

In May 2005 the team flew to China, to practise against the hosting country, Poland and Bulgaria. Some of the players (Ingrid Visser, Francien Huurman, Alice Blom and Janneke van Tienen) didn’t travel to Asia, as Selinger wanted them to have a period of rest after their long competition program.  

The World Grand Prix 2005 began well for the Dutch team on June 24. The Netherlands defeated the USA (3-0). One day later, they lost to PR China, but Selinger’s team was again too strong for Thailand (3-0). In the second WGP playing round the Netherlands started by defeating Italy with a clear 3-0. A victory on Cuba was just missed (2-3), but Thailand was defeated once again. 

The third round began with a loss against the Olympic and World Champion Brazil (1-3).

By winning all three matches, against Ukraine, Belgium and Turkey, they qualified. After a few friendly matches against Russia, Poland, Bulgaria and Germany, the European Championships in Croatia started on September 17.
