'''Johannes Brahms''' (pronounced [joːˈhanəs ˈbʁaːms]) (May 7, 1833 &ndash; April 3, 1897) was a German Romantic period. He was born in Hamburg and in his later years he settled in Vienna, Austria.

==Life==
===Early years===
Brahms's father, Johann Jakob Brahms, came to Hamburg from horn and thumb|left|House in Hamburg where Brahms was born 

Johann Jakob gave his son his first musical training. He studied piano from the age of seven with Otto Friedrich Willibald Cossel. Brahms showed early promise (his younger brother Fritz also became a pianist) and helped to supplement the rather meager family income by playing the piano in restaurants and theaters, as well as by teaching. It is a long-told tale that Brahms was forced in his early teens to play the piano in bars that doubled as brothels; recently Brahms scholar Kurt Hoffman has suggested that this legend is false. Since Brahms himself clearly originated the story, however, some have questioned Hoffman's theory.<ref>Kurt Hoffman, ''Johannes Brahms und Hamburg'' (Reinbek, 1986) (in German: includes detailed refutation of the traditional story of Brahms playing piano in brothels, using the writings of those who knew the young Brahms, as well as evidence of the Hamburg's close regulation of those places, preventing the employment of children)</ref><ref></ref>

For a time, Brahms also learned the cello, although his progress was cut short when his teacher absconded with Brahms' instrument. After his early piano lessons with Otto Cossel, Brahms studied piano with Mozart) and Schubert). The young Brahms gave a few public concerts in Hamburg, but did not become well known as a pianist until he made a concert tour at the age of nineteen. In later life, he frequently took part in the performance of his own works, whether as soloist, accompanist, or participant in chamber music. He was the soloist at the premieres of both his Piano Concerto No. 1 in 1859 and his Piano Concerto No. 2 in 1881. He conducted choirs from his early teens, and became a proficient choral and orchestral conductor.

===Meeting Joachim and Liszt===
He began to compose quite early in life, but later destroyed most copies of his first works; for instance, Sonata in B minor wholeheartedly (Brahms supposedly fell asleep during a performance of the recently composed work), and they parted company shortly afterwards.  Brahms later excused himself, saying that he could not help it, having been exhausted by his travels.

===Brahms and Schumann===
Joachim had given Brahms a letter of introduction to Robert Schumann, and after a walking tour in the Rhineland Brahms took the train to Düsseldorf, and was welcomed into the Schumann family on arrival there. Schumann, amazed by the 20 year-old's talent, published an article entitled "''Neue Bahnen''" (New Paths) in the October 28, 1853 issue of the journal ''Neue Zeitschrift für Musik'' alerting the public to the young man who he claimed was "destined to give ideal expression to the times."<ref name =bahne>{{cite web

}}</ref> This pronouncement was received with some skepticism outside Schumann's immediate circle, and may have increased Brahms' naturally self-critical  need to perfect his works and technique. While he was in Düsseldorf, Brahms participated with Schumann and F-A-E Sonata''. He became very attached to Schumann's wife, the composer and pianist Clara, fourteen years his senior, with whom he would carry on a lifelong, emotionally passionate, but probably platonic, relationship. Brahms never married, despite strong feelings for several women and despite entering into an engagement, soon broken off, with Agathe von Siebold in Göttingen in 1859. After Schumann's attempted suicide and subsequent confinement in a mental sanatorium near Bonn in February 1854, Brahms was the main intercessor between Clara and her husband, and found himself virtually head of the household.

===Detmold and Hamburg===
After Schumann's death at the sanatorium in 1856, Brahms divided his time between Hamburg, where he formed and conducted a ladies' choir, and the principality of Detmold, where he was court music-teacher and conductor. He first visited Vienna in 1862, staying there over the winter, and in 1863 was appointed conductor of the Vienna Singakademie. Though he resigned the position the following year and entertained the idea of taking up conducting posts elsewhere, he based himself increasingly in Vienna and soon made his home there. From 1872 to 1875 he was director of the concerts of the Vienna ''Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde''; afterwards he accepted no formal position. He declined an honorary doctorate of music from University of Cambridge in 1877, but accepted one from the University of Breslau in 1879, and composed the ''Academic Festival Overture'' as a gesture of appreciation.

He had been composing steadily throughout the 1850s and 60s, but his music had evoked divided critical responses and the Piano Concerto No. 1 had been badly received in some of its early performances. His works were labelled old-fashioned by the 'New German School' whose principal figures included Liszt and Richard Wagner. Brahms admired some of Wagner's music and admired Liszt as a great pianist, but the conflict between the two schools, known as the War of the Romantics, soon embroiled all of musical Europe. In the Brahms camp were his close friends: Clara Schumann, the influential music critic Eduard Hanslick and the leading Viennese surgeon Theodor Billroth. In 1860 Brahms attempted to organize a public protest against some of the wilder excesses of their music. His manifesto, which was published prematurely with only three supporting signatures, was a failure and he never engaged in public polemics again.

===Years of popularity===
It was the premiere of ''Bremen in 1868 that confirmed Brahms' European reputation and led many to accept that he had fulfilled Schumann's prophecy. This may have given him the confidence finally to complete a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years, such as the cantata ''Rinaldo'', his first string quartet, third piano quartet, and most notably his first symphony. This appeared in 1876, though it had been begun (and a version of the first movement seen by some of his friends) in the early 1860s. The other three symphonies then followed in 1877, 1883, and 1885. From 1881 he was able to try out his new orchestral works with the court orchestra of the Duke of Meiningen, whose conductor was Hans von Bülow.

Brahms frequently traveled, for both business (concert tours) and pleasure. From 1878 onwards he often visited Italy in the springtime, and usually sought out a pleasant rural location in which to compose during the summer. He was a great walker and especially enjoyed spending time in the open air, where he felt that he could think more clearly.

In 1889, one Theo Wangemann, a representative of American inventor Thomas Edison visited the composer in Vienna and invited him to make an experimental recording. He played an abbreviated version of his first Hungarian dance on the piano. The recording was later issued on an LP of early piano performances (compiled by Gregor Benko); while the spoken introduction to the short piece of music is quite clear, the piano playing is largely inaudible due to heavy surface noise. Nevertheless, this remains the earliest recording made by a major composer. Analysts and scholars remain divided, however, as to whether the voice that introduces the piece is that of Wangemann or of Brahms.<ref></ref>

In 1889 Brahms was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg, until 1948 the only one born in Hamburg. <ref>[http://fhh.hamburg.de/stadt/Aktuell/senat/service/ehrenbuerger/start.html Stadt Hamburg Ehrenbürger]  Retrieved on June 17, 2008</ref>

===Later years===
In 1890, the 57 year-old Brahms resolved to give up composing. However, as it turned out, he was unable to abide by his decision, and in the years before his death he produced a number of acknowledged masterpieces. His admiration for Clarinet Trio Op. 114, Clarinet Quintet Op. 115 (1891), and the two Clarinet Sonatas Op. 120 (1894). He also wrote several cycles of piano pieces, Opp. 116-119, the Four Serious Songs (''Vier ernste Gesänge''), Op. 121 (1896), and the Eleven Chorale Preludes for organ, Op. 122 (1896).

While completing the Op. 121 songs, Brahms developed cancer (sources differ on whether this was of the liver or pancreas). His condition gradually worsened and he died on April 3, 1897. Brahms is buried in the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna.

===Works===

Brahms wrote a number of major works for orchestra, including two symphonies, two No. 1 in D minor; No. 2 in B flat major), a Violin Concerto, a Double Concerto for violin and cello, and two orchestral overtures, the Academic Festival Overture and the Tragic Overture.

His large choral work ''Lutheran Bible. The work was composed in three major periods of his life. An early version of the second movement was first composed in 1854, not long after Robert Schumann's attempted suicide, and this was later used in his first piano concerto. The majority of the Requiem was composed after his mother's death in 1865. The fifth movement was added after the official premiere in 1868, and the work was published in 1869.

Brahms' works in variation form include the ''Paganini Variations'', both for solo piano, and the ''Fourth Symphony (Op. 98) is formally a passacaglia.

His chamber works include three string quartets, two string quintets and two string sextets, a clarinet quintet, a clarinet trio, a horn trio, a piano quintet, three piano quartets and four piano trios (the fourth being "opus posthumous"). He composed several instrumental sonatas with piano, including three for violin, two for cello and two for clarinet (which were subsequently arranged for ballades to his late sets of character pieces.  Brahms was a significant organ op. 122, which he wrote shortly before his death, have become an important part of the organist's repertoire.

Brahms strongly preferred writing absolute music that does not refer to an explicit scene or narrative, and he never wrote an opera or a symphonic poem.

Despite his reputation as a serious composer of large, complex musical structures, some of Brahms' most widely known and most commercially successful compositions during his life were small-scale works of popular intent aimed at the thriving contemporary market for domestic music-making; indeed, during the 20th century the influential American critic Hungarian Dances, the ''Waltzes'' Op. 39 for piano duet, and the ''Liebeslieder Waltzes'' for vocal quartet and piano—and some of his many songs, notably the ''Wiegenlied'', Op. 49 No. 4 (published in 1868).  This last was written (to a folk text) to celebrate the birth of a son to Brahms' friend Bertha Faber and is universally known as ''Brahms' Lullaby''.

===Style and influences===
Brahms maintained a Classical sense of form and order in his works&nbsp;– in contrast to the opulence of the music of many of his contemporaries. Thus many admirers (though not necessarily Brahms himself) saw him as the champion of traditional forms and "pure music," as opposed to the New German embrace of program music.

Brahms venerated Beethoven: in the composer's home, a marble bust of Beethoven looked down on the spot where he composed, and some passages in his works are reminiscent of Beethoven's style.  The main theme of the finale of Brahms's First Symphony is reminiscent of the main theme of the finale of Beethoven's Ninth, and when this resemblance was pointed out to Brahms he replied that any ass&nbsp;– ''jeder Esel''&nbsp;– could see that.

''First Piano Concerto.

Brahms also loved the Classical composers Mozart and Haydn. He collected first editions and autographs of their works, and edited performing editions. He also studied the music of pre-classical composers, including Baroque sources, such as Bach's Fourth Symphony's ''finale''.

The early Romantic composers also had a major influence on Brahms, particularly Schumann who encouraged Brahms as a young composer. Brahms often met Robert and James Webster, "Schubert's sonata form and Brahms' first maturity (II)", ''19th-century Music'' 3(1) (1979), pp. 52-71.</ref> The latter's influence may be identified in works by Brahms dating from the period, such as the two piano quartets Op. 25 & Op. 26, and the Piano Quintet which alludes to Schubert's String Quintet and Grand Duo for piano four hands.<ref>Chopin and Mendelssohn on Brahms, although occasionally one can find in his works what seems to be an allusion to one of their works (for example, Brahms' Scherzo Op. 4 alludes to Chopin's Scherzo in B-flat minor;<ref>piano sonata in F minor, Op. 5 alludes to the finale of Mendelssohn's piano trio in C minor<ref>H. V. Spanner, "What is originality?", ''The Musical Times'' 93(1313) (1952), pp. 310-311.</ref>). 

Brahms considered giving up composition when it seemed that other composers' innovations in extended tonality would result in the rule of tonality being broken altogether.  Although Wagner became fiercely critical of Brahms as the latter grew in stature and popularity, he was enthusiastically receptive of the early Variations on a Theme by Handel; Brahms himself, according to many sources (Swafford, 1999), deeply admired Wagner's music, confining his ambivalence only to the dramaturgical precepts of Wagner's theory.

Brahms wrote settings for piano and voice of 144 German folk songs, and many of his lieder reflect folk themes or depict scenes of rural life.  His ''Hungarian dances'' were among his most profitable compositions.

Although Brahms' religious views are not clear, one of his greatest influences was the Bible. He read especially Luther's translation.  His "Requiem" employs biblical texts to convey a humanist message, and focus on the living rather than the dead. Author Walter Niemann declared, "The fact that Brahms began his creative activity with the German folk song and closed with the Bible reveals...the true religious creed of this great man of the people."  Others see Brahms as more of a cultural Lutheran who embraced the cultural aspects of his upbringing but may or may not have adopted the religious beliefs.<ref>Beller-McKenna, Daniel.

'''Йоханес Брамс''' (на немски: ''Johannes Brahms'') е пианист и романтизма. Смятан е от мнозина за „наследник“ на Лудвиг ван Бетховен и първата му симфония е описана от Ханс фон Бюлов като „Десетата симфония на Бетховен“.

== Биография ==

Брамс е роден на 7 май 1833 г. в Хамбург и умира на 3 април 1897 г. във Виена от рак на черния дроб. 

== Музика ==

Брамс е автор на няколко големи произведения за симфонии, два песни. Брамс никога не е писал опери, нито характерните за 19 век тонални поеми.

Когато Йоханес Брамс написва първата си симфония, един от съвременниците му подхварля крилатата фраза,че тази творба е сякаш десетата симфония на Бетховен. Деиствително Брамс ,както никой друг от съвременниците си ,остава верен на класическата традиция. Но в неговата музика се разгръща и лиричната пълнота,емоционалната непосредственост на романтизма, в нея се възраждат и някои от строгите възвишени образи на Баховата епоха. Немският композитор се отличава с особено богатство на музикалното мислене, с дълбочина, която се долавя най-ясно в големите му симфонични и сонатни произведения.
