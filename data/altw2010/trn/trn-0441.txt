==Biography==
Palmer grew up in Lexington High School, where she was heavily involved in the busked as a self-titled CD, with the song "The Perfect Fit": <blockquote>"I can paint my face<br />
And stand very, very still<br />
It's not very practical<br />
But it still pays the bills"</blockquote> as well as on the ''A is for Accident'' track "Glass Slipper": <blockquote>"I give out flowers<br />To curious strangers<br />who throw dollars at my feet."</blockquote> A group of white-painted living statues appears in the music video to the single "Sing" from the Dresden Dolls' album ''Yes, Virginia....''

Despite the fact that Palmer never learned to read music (though she briefly took lessons at two different times), she formed a band called "Amanda Palmer and the Void".

===The Dresden Dolls===
thumb|right|Amanda Palmer and Brian Viglione, members of The Dresden Dolls
In October 2000, Palmer met drummer Brian Viglione and together they formed the Dresden Dolls. In an effort to expand the performance experience and interactivity, Palmer began inviting Lexington High School students to perform drama pieces at her live shows.  Currently, the Dirty Business Brigade, a troupe of seasoned and new artists, perform at almost every gig.  The invited costumed characters mingle with the crowd before and during the show, and veteran groups sometimes join in with a choreographed stage act.  Life-sized marionettes, coin-operated boys, living statues, and other undergroundlings greet fans while circus and burlesque draw the audience into the Dolls' music, creating a participatory atmosphere which allows the audience to experience numerous types of art simultaneously.

In 2006, the ''Dresden Dolls Companion'',<ref  name="DDcompanion">Dresden Dolls Companion, by Amanda Palmer, eight foot music publishing, June, 2006, ISBN 157560888X ISBN 978-1575608884</ref> was published, with "words, music & artwork" by Amanda Palmer.<ref  name="DDcompanion"/>  In it she has written a history of the album ''The Dresden Dolls'' and of the duo, as well as a partial autobiography.  The book also contains the lyrics, sheet music, and notes on each song in the album, all written by her, as well as a DVD with a 20 minute interview of Amanda about making the book.

In June 2007, as part of the Dresden Dolls, she toured with the True Colors Tour 2007,<ref>[http://www.truecolorstour.com/ True Colors Tour web site.]</ref> including her debut in New York City's Radio City Music Hall,<ref name="nyt20070620">{{cite news

Their set was a concise demonstration of cabaret-punk. Ms. Palmer, singing throatily at an electric keyboard, held her own not only on the band staple “Coin-Operated Boy” but also even amid the bombast of “War Pigs,” the Black Sabbath screed.

===Amanda Palmer and the Onion Cellar===
Palmer conceived a musical, The Onion Cellar, which the Dresden Dolls performed in conjunction with the American Repertory Theatre at the Zero Arrow Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from December 9, 2006 to January 13, 2007.<ref>{{cite web

'''Amanda Palmer''' (* 30. April 1976) ist eine US-amerikanische Musikerin, Lyrikerin und Kabarettistin. Internationale Bekanntheit erlangte sie vor allem als Mitglied der zweiköpfigen Band The Dresden Dolls.

== Werdegang ==

Amanda Palmer wuchs in Lexington auf. Obwohl sie das komponierte erste Melodien. Im Alter von zehn Jahren kreierte sie ihr erstes Musical. Laut eigenen Angaben hatte Palmer in ihrer Jugend nur wenige Freunde und verbrachte ihre Freizeit vorwiegend damit, Lieder und Texte zu schreiben. <ref>[http://www.dresdendolls.com/bio/bio_amanda.htm Amanda Palmers Autobiografie]</ref>

Auf einer Party im Oktober 2000 traf sie auf den Schlagzeuger Brian Viglione, mit dem sie sich auf Anhieb gut verstand. Viglione mochte Palmers Lieder und einige Tage später trafen sie sich, um zusammen zu spielen. Dies war der Anfang der Band ''The Dresden Dolls''.

Zu Amanda Palmers Markenzeichen gehören ihre einzigartige Stimme sowie auch ihr extravaganter Kleidungsstil; im Jahre 2006 wurde sie zur „stylishsten“ Frau aus Boston gekürt. <ref>[http://www.boston.com/yourlife/fashion/gallery/1102_top25?pg=54 Boston’s stylish 25]</ref>

Ein immer wiederkehrendes Thema in Palmers Songtexten ist die bisexuell. <ref>[http://www.247gay.com/article.cfm?section=68&id=9942 Interview mit Amanda Palmer]</ref> Sie und Viglione waren nie ein Paar, was von Anfang an der ausdrückliche Wunsch der Pianistin war. Eine derartige Beziehung zerbräche sehr schnell und die Musik sei wichtiger als alles andere, so Palmer. <ref>[http://www.nolabel.at/index.php?id=89&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=180&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=45&cHash=59f2ebe740 Interview mit Brian Viglione]</ref>

Für den Frühling 2008 wurde ein Soloalbum mit dem Titel ''Who Killed Amanda Palmer'' angekündigt. Ihr Kollege Ben Folds ist dabei als Produzent tätig und wird ebenfalls auf der CD zu hören sein. <ref>[http://www.spin.com/features/news/2007/04/070425_apalmer Artikel auf spin.com]</ref>
