'''Lonhro''' is an AU$5,790,510 . He was quite versatile; winning from 1100 m to 2000 m and with his stunning looks and racing style, where he would often settle last before unleasing a paralysing sprint, he quickly endeared himself to the Australian public. Highlighting this was the fact that he started favourite in 31 of his 35 races, including the last 25 in succession and 21 as odds on favourite. He got the name Lonhro due to his foaling description as "tiny but perfect", a common label given to  Roland "Tiny" Rowland, CEO of the London Rhodesian Mining and Land Company (stock exchange code LONRHO). The horse's name is deliberately misspelt. [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/12/1078594564107.html?from=storyrhs]

==2yo==
Lonhro had his first start in November 2000 in a restricted 2yo race at Rosehill where he finished second. A short spell followed and Lonhro resumed in January 2001 over 1100 m at Rosehill, starting favourite for the first time and winning in good fashion by 2.5 lengths.   Two weeks later Lonhro was in Melbourne at Caulfield for the Blue Diamond Prelude. In the straight, Lonhro impressed the Melbourne crowd by striding well clear to win by two lengths from the fast finishing Neiwand with Tosamba third.
It was then on to the Blue Diamond Stakes where Lonhro started the $3.50 favourite.   Settling near the rear of the field, Lonhro came wide in the straight making ground on the leaders but unable to catch the eventual winner True Jewels, finishing 1.5L fourth. Instead of pressing on to the Sydney carnival Lonhro was spelled as another near black Woodlands colt called Viscount won the AJC Sires Produce and Champagne Stakes.  

Lonhro returned for the 2001 Spring in the WFA Missile Stakes, being run in July he was still officially a 2yo. Settling last of nine runners on a heavy track, Lonhro stormed home to finished third to Sportsbrat, this was to be the first and last time that Lonhro would be defeated in consecutive races.

==3yo==
A rematch with Sportsbrat in the WFA Warwick Stakes-Gr2 (1300m) followed two weeks later. This time Lonhro settled closer to the lead and was able register his first win as a 3yo. For his next start Lonhro went back to his own age group in the Ming Dynasty Quality-Gr3 (1400m) and held on to win by a short half-head after being sent out a very short priced favourite.  
An easy win in the Heritage Stakes-LR (1200m) followed before he took out the Stan Fox Stakes-Gr2 (1400m) against a small but quality field.  
Lonhro then headed to Melbourne for the Caulfield Guineas-Gr1 (1600m) but despite his four consecutive wins he was not the Hawkes' stable favoured runner. That honour went to the multiple Group 1 winner Viscount who had started his spring campaign in Sydney and had recorded victory in the George Main Stakes-Gr1 (1600m) where he, like Lonhro, had defeated Shogun Lodge. In the Caulfield Guineas, the boom colts Ustinov and Viking Ruler also lined up along with New Zealander Pure Theatre, Dash for Cash and Magic Albert. Lonhro settled last before pulling out wide to the centre of the track to start his run on the home turn. Inside the final 50m Lonhro swept to the front from Pure Theatre and Ustinov as Viking Ruler ran on near the rails but it was all Lonhro as he came away to win by 1 1/2 lengths from Ustinov with Pure Theatre third.

After the victory it was reported that Lonhro had suffered an injury with a minor wrench to a joint and it was felt in his best interests to spell for the autumn, meaning he would miss the WS Cox Plate. Stablemate Viscount who was beaten in the Caulfield Guineas went on to Moonee Valley and was gallant in finishing third to Northerly and Sunline, beaten just a length, in a rough-house finish that was the subject of a long protest hearing. 

On 2 February 2002, Lonhro lined up as the odds-on favourite for the Royal Sovereign Stakes-Gr2 (1200m), beginning a run of 25 consecutive races that he would start as favourite.  Lonhro easily accounted for the small field before going on to win the Hobartville Stakes-Gr2 (1400m) at his next start. Installed as pre-post favourite for the Doncaster Handicap and a nominal favourite for many of the big races of the Autumn, it was announced soon after that Lonhro has contracted a virus and the resultant delay in his preparation saw the 3yo spelled until his four year old season.

==4yo==

Lonhro returned bigger and stronger as a 4yo and again started his campaign in the Missile S-Gr3 (1100m) at Rosehill. This was the first race where Lonhro was ridden by Darren Beadman and it was Lonhro's eighth consecutive victory, winning very easily by four lengths. As the short priced favourite Lonhro was expected to have no problem taking out the Warwick S-Gr2 (1400m) at his next start but was beaten a half head by Defier. Two weeks later Lonhro made amends winning the Chelmsford S-Gr2 (1600m) at Randwick by three lengths. At his next start only six horses lined up for the George Main Stakes-Gr1 (1600m) but it was described as a mini Cox Plate with Sunline, Defier, Lonhro, Excellerator and Shogun Lodge entered. Desperately unlucky, Lonhro was pocketed on the fence for much of the race and only saw daylight in the last 50m, sprinting home to finish fourth. Sunline set a moderate pace in front from Defier then Shogun Lodge outside Lonhro with Hey Pronto and Excellerator at the rear.  

Lonhro was then sent to Melbourne for a rematch with Sunline in the Caulfield Stakes-Gr1 (2000m). A field of seven lined up but all race discussions were whether Sunline as a 7yo would return to form and if Lonhro having his first start beyond 1600m would be as effective over 2000m.  The race was a spectacle with Sunline assuming her usual front running style and Lonhro stalking for most of the race in about third position. Little changed up to the 800m where Sunline started to show her old form as she quickened from Ustinov and Lonhro started the long chase with Distinctly Secret heading the rest but they were in another race. Around the turn and the crowd roared as Sunline raced clear of Ustinov with Lonhro steadily making ground but giving the mare a huge head start. By the 300m Sunline was over three lengths clear as Lonhro settled into his task. By the 200m Sunline was in front but Lonhro was gaining and the crowd was deafening as the two great horses fought out the race. Inside the final 50m Sunline and Lonhro were level with the mare fighting back strongly but her younger rival edged in front to win by a half neck in race record time of 2:00:60. 

Both horses then headed to the WS Cox Plate two weeks later where Lonhro started $4 equal favouite with Northerly, but fans wondered how much the titanic struggle at Caulfield may have taken out of him. Settling last in a field of nine, Lonhro was  beaten, finishing 7.3 lengths behind Northerly. Lonhro backed up a week later in the Mackinnon S-Gr1 (2000m) at Flemington, edging out Royal Code to finish his 2002 spring campaign.

Lonhro resumed in the 2003 autumn winning in the Expressway S-Gr2 (1200m) by 2 lengths, three weeks later he crushed field in the Apollo S-Gr2 (1400m), winning by 3.5 lengths with a further 2 lengths to third. He was back a week later in the Grand Armee , carrying 6kgs less than Lonhro, hit the front and race clear to pass the post three lengths ahead of Dash For Cash with two lengths to Boreale who held out Lonhro for third. This was Lonhro's third and final unplaced run in a race.
Lonhro rounded out his autumn a week later in the Queen Elizabeth S-Gr1 (2000m), making amends for his Doncaster failure in winning by 1.5 lengths.  

There was brief speculation that Lonhro might be retired to stud but it was soon announced that Lonhro would return to racing as a 5yo with the WS Cox Plate his spring target. Sadly Lonhro's part owner Mr Jack Ingham passed away after a long battle with illness in August 2003 as Lonhro prepared to return to racing.

==5yo==
August 2003, Lonhro began his 5yo season with his second win in the AJC Warwick S-Gr2 (1400m). Two weeks later, it was on to the Chelmsford S-Gr2 (1600m) where Lonhro again cruised to an easy win. The WFA George Main Stakes-Gr1 (1600m) at Randwick and a rematch with Grand Armee was next. In a slowly run race Lonhro defeated Grand Armee by three lengths, with a further two lengths to the previous year's winner Defier in third. It was then to back to Melbourne for the Caulfield Stakes-Gr1 (2000m) where Lonhro had a much easier time beating Mummify, than the previous year when he battled with Sunline. Winning by two lengths, Lonhro became the first horse to win consecutive Caulfield Stakes since Kingston Town in 1981 and 1982.    

Two weeks later Lonho looked invincible in the Cox Plate-Gr1 (2040m) with recent stars Sunline and Northerly missing and only Defier and Fields of Omagh joining Lonhro from the 2002 field. There were doubts over Lonhro handling the Moonee Valley surface but his class was expected to overcome any problems. Then in the 40 minutes before the race it began to rain, continuing through to the race itself. Fields of Omagh hit the lead around the turn as Defier challenged and Lonhro lost ground trying to balance up for the straight. In the straight, Fields of Omagh refused to give in to Defier with Lonhro charging down the outside. But it was too late as Fields of Omagh crossed the line to win by a long neck from Defier with Lonhro a half length away third as the rest of the field came in at intervals behind them. Lonhro returned to NSW to spell over the christmas period. 

After it appeared he would restart his 2004 racing in Sydney, Lonhro was a surprise entry in the C.F. Orr S-Gr1 (1400m) at Caulfield.  Inside the final 100m Lonhro swept up on the outside to hit the front from Sound Action and Super Elegant as Vocabulary took a narrow run between them. Vocabulary lunged at Lonhro but he was too good winning by a half head with Sound Action third. Lonhro took on a similar field in the St George S-Gr2(1800m) two weeks later, winning eased up by 1.5 lengths. Lonhro then lined up in his final race in Melbourne in the Australian Cup-Gr1 (2000m) at Flemington and the Victorian Racing Club made the day into a farewell for the champ - all he had to do was win.

The field featured the stars of the spring with Lonhro joined by Makybe Diva (Melbourne Cup), Mummify (Caulfield Cup), Elvstroem (VRC Derby) plus Group 1 winner Sound Action, promising 3yo Delzao and the honest stayer Pentastic. On settling, Physique led Mummify then Sound Action followed by Lonhro inside Delzao then Zacielo followed by Elvstroem, then Pentastic with Zazzman and Makybe Diva at the rear. Little changed to the turn where Physique led Mummify with Sound Action joining them with Lonhro pocketed as Delzao improved with Elvstroem next. With 300m left, Physique led Mummify and Sound Action with Lonhro trying to take the run between the pair but it closed as they drifted together. Lonhro was checked and Delzao held him in the pocket. With 200m left, Mummify and Sound Action were fighting it out as Delzao made his run forcing Lonhro to check again and turn sideways to get clear on the outside but with a lot of ground to make up and his rhythm gone. By the 100m Delzao was two lengths clear and responding to his rider's hard riding from Sound Action as Lonhro got balanced to chase from Mummify with Makybe Diva making ground along the rail and Elvstroem and Pentastic out wider. The trackside crowd was going crazy and the sound levels were explosive. 50m from home Delzao was still a half-length in front but Lonhro showed his champion qualities in never giving up the chase. Slowly but surely Lonhro was gaining on the 3yo Delzao and hit the front three strides from the post to win by a half neck with a gap to Elvstroem third and Pentastic fourth. It was an emotional win for connections and race fans as even his critics realised how special Lonhro really was.
