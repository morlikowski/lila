'''Onalaska''' is a city in La Crosse County, towns including: Onalaska, Medary, and Hamilton.

The original village (now city) was platted by Thomas G. Rowe (New York) and John C. Laird (Pennsylvania) in 1851.  In its early days, lumbering and related industries served as a basis for its economy.<ref>[http://www.historyofonalaska.com/early_history.html circle alaska hotel tour airline at historyofonalaska.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The City of Onalaska is primarily built on a slightly elevated ridge above the Black River.  Natural areas include river bottomland as well as high, heavily wooded, scenic bluffs. It is known as "The Sunfish Capital of the World."  A manmade reservoir at the city's western edge is known as Lake Onalaska.

== Use of the Name Onalaska in the United States ==
The name for the city comes from the poem, "The Pleasures of Hope," by Scottish poet Thomas Campbell.  The original spelling of the name in Campbell's poem was "Oonalaska" (an Aleutian island and fishing village).<ref>[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-pleasures-of-hope-excerpt The Pleasures of Hope (excerpt) by Thomas Campbell<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  

Onalaska, Wisconsin, Onalaska, Arkansas (now defunct), Onalaska, Texas, and Onalaska, Washington are all historically linked to one another through the lumber industry.  The modern day City of Unalaska, Alaska and Unalaska Island are linked to the Onalaskas in the lower 48 states through Thomas Campbell's poem.  Unalaska, Alaska is the original Oonalaska or Onalaska or "Ounalashka"  (Russian spelling) immortalized by Campbell.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 9.7&nbsp;square miles (25.1&nbsp;km²), of which, 9.1&nbsp;square miles (23.5&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.6&nbsp;square miles (1.5&nbsp;km²) of it (5.99%) is water.

Named streams within the current corporate limits of the city include the Black River, the La Crosse River, and Sand Lake Coulee Creek.  In the 1930s, construction of Lake Onalaska resulted in the flooding and eventual disappearance of a shallow, natural body of water, Rice Lake, as well as several smaller ponds in the Black River bottoms area.

Brice Prairie is an urban reserve area of the City of Onalaska.  It lies to the northwest of Onalaska's current northern border.

Onalaska lies immediately north of La Crosse, Wisconsin.
