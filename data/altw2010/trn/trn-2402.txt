'''Jackson Carey Frank''' (American folk musician.

==Early life==
At the age of 11, a furnace exploded, sending a ball of flames down corridors until it ended up in Frank's music classroom in the Cleveland Hill Elementary School in Cheektowaga, New York. <ref>[http://www.talkingproud.us/Education040206.html Rising to great acts of heroism, the tragedies of deadly school fires<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The fire killed fifteen of his fellow students and hospitalized him for seven months. It was during his time in the hospital that he was first introduced to playing music, when a teacher, Charlie Castelli, brought in an acoustic guitar to keep Frank occupied during his recovery. When he was 21, he was awarded an insurance check of $100,000 for his injuries, giving him enough to catch a boat to England.

==Music career==
His 1965 self-titled album, ''Jackson C. Frank'', was produced by Paul Simon whilst both men were playing folk clubs in England. Jackson was so shy during the recording that he requested upon being shielded by screens so that Paul Simon, Art Garfunkel, and Al Stewart (who also attended the recording) could not see him, claiming 'I can't play. You're looking at me.' The most famous track, "Blues Run the Game", was covered by Simon and Garfunkel, and later by Counting Crows and Colin Meloy. Another song, "Milk and Honey", appeared in  Vincent Gallo's film ''The Brown Bunny'', and was also covered by Fairport Convention, Nick Drake, and Sandy Denny, whom he dated for a while. During their relationship, Jackson convinced Sandy to give up nursing (her current profession) and concentrate on music full time.

Although Frank was well received in England, for a while, in 1966, things took a turn for the worse, with more dynamic Rock bands becoming popular. At the same time, Frank began to experience writer's block. His insurance cheque was running out, so he decided to go back to the USA for two years. When he returned to England in 1968, he was deemed a different person. His depression from the fire had increased, and he had no self-confidence. Al Stewart recalled, 

:"''He proceeded to fall apart before our very eyes. His style that everyone loved was melancholy, very tuneful things. He started doing things that were completely impenetrable. They were basically about psychological angst, played at full volume with lots of thrashing. I don't remember a single word of them, it just did not work. There was one review that said he belonged on a psychologist's couch. Then shortly after that, he hightailed it back to Woodstock again, because he wasn't getting any work.''"

==Woodstock 1970==
While in Woodstock, he married Elaine Sedgwick, an English former fashion model. They had a son, though he unfortunately died of Cystic Fibrosis, and later a daughter, Angeline. This sent Frank into a period of great depression, and he was committed to an institution. By the early 70's Frank had become so pitiful that he began to beg aid from friends. Karl Dallas wrote an enthusiastic piece in 1975 in Melody Maker, and in 1978, his 1965 album was re-released as Jackson Frank Again, with a new cover sleeve, although this did not encourage fresh awareness of Frank.

In 1984, Frank took a trip to New York in a desperate bid to locate Paul Simon, but he ended up sleeping on the sidewalk. His mother, who had been in hospital for open heart surgery, found him gone with no forwarding address when she arrived home. He was living on the street, and was frequently admitted and discharged from various institutions. He was treated for paranoid schizophrenia, when he actually had depression caused by the trauma he’d experienced as a child. Just as Frank’s prospects seemed to be at their worst, a fan from the area around Woodstock, Jimmy Abbott, discovered him in the early 1990’s. Abbott had been discussing music with Mark Anderson, a teacher at the local college he was attending. The conversation had turned to folk music, which they both enjoyed, when Abbott asked the teacher if he’d heard of Jackson C. Frank. He recollects:

:"''I hadn’t even thought about it for a couple of years, and he goes, ‘Well yes, as a matter of fact, I just got a letter from him. Do you feel like helping a down-on-his-luck folk singer?''"
