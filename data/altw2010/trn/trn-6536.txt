'''Президентские выборы в США 1800 года''' называют ''революцией 1800 года''. На этих выборах вице-президент Джона Адамса, стал третьим президентом США. Выборы привели к власти демократическо-республиканскую партию и в конечном итоге вызвали распад федералистской партии.

Кроме того, выборы показали недостатки принятой Конституции. Выборщики имели каждый по два голоса, но могли голосовать только за президента, а вице-президентом автоматически становился кандидат, ставший вторым. Демократы-республиканцы планировали проголосовать таким образом, чтобы один из их выборщиков проголосовал лишь один раз и таким образом Томас Джефферсон набрал бы на один голос больше Аарона Бура, который бы становился вице-президентом при Джефферсоне. Однако в результате неразберихи оба кандидата от демократов-республиканцев получили равное количество голосов. Судьба будущего президента оказалась в руках Палаты представителей, где большинством тогда обладали федералисты. Чтобы лишить Джефферсона президенства, федералисты голосовали за Бурра. Это привело к недельному тупику в дебатах. Лишь вмешательство лидера федералистов Александра Гамильтона, который ненавидел Бурра больше, чем Джефферсона разрешило вопрос в пользу последнего. Чтобы исключить в будущем подобную неопределённость в 1804 году была принята ''Двенадцатая поправка'' к Конституции, которая позволяла выборщикам голосовать одним голосом за президента, а вторым — за вице-президента.

In the '''United States Presidential election of 1800''', sometimes referred to as the “Revolution of 1800”, Vice President Democratic-Republican Party rule and the eventual demise of the Federalist Party.

The election exposed one of the flaws in the original Constitution. Members of the Vice President was the person who received the second largest number of votes during the election. The Democratic-Republicans had planned for one of the electors to abstain from casting his second vote for House of Representatives controlled by the Federalist Party. Most Federalists voted for Burr in order to block Jefferson from the Presidency, and the result was a week of deadlock. Federalist duel with Burr,<ref>Kennedy, ''Burr, Hamilton, and Jefferson'', p. 72.</ref> which resulted in Hamilton's death in 1804.

The Twelfth Amendment, ratified in 1804, was added to the United States Constitution. The Twelfth Amendment stipulates that electors make a distinct choice between their selections for President and Vice President.

Jefferson's 22.8% victory margin in the popular vote is the largest ever victory margin for a challenger to an incumbent President.

=== Campaign ===

The 1800 election was a rematch of the 1796 election. The campaign was bitter and characterized  by slander and personal attacks on both sides. Federalists spread rumors that the Democratic-Republicans were radicals who would murder their opponents, burn churches, and destroy the country (based on the Democratic-Republican preference for France over Britain. At the time, the rather violent French revolution was in full swing). In 1798, George Washington (who had no political party) had complained "that you could as soon scrub the blackamoor white, as to change the principles of a profest [''sic''] Democrat; and that he will leave nothing unattempted to overturn the Government of this Country.”<ref></ref> Meanwhile, the Democratic-Republicans accused Federalists of destroying republican values, not to mention political support from immigrants, with the Alien and Sedition Acts, which were later ruled unconstitutional; they also accused Federalists of favoring Britain in order to promote aristocratic, anti-republican values.<ref>Buel (1972)</ref>

Adams was attacked by both the opposition Democratic-Republicans and by "High Federalists" in his own Federalist Party who were aligned with Hamilton. The Democratic-Republicans felt that Adams' foreign policy was too favorable toward Britain, feared that the new army called up for the Quasi-War would oppress the people, opposed Adams' new taxes, and attacked his Alien and Sedition Acts as violations of states' rights and the Constitution. A faction of “High Federalists” considered Adams too moderate; it would seem natural that Federalist leader Alexander Hamilton, in his third sabotage attempt towards Adams<ref>McCullough (2001)</ref>, schemed to elect Vice Presidential candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney to the Presidency. One of Hamilton's letters, providing a scathing criticism of Adams and spanning fifty-four pages<ref>Chernow (2004)</ref>, became public when it came into the hands of a Republican, embarrassing Adams and damaging Hamilton's efforts on behalf of Pinckney<ref>Ferling (2004)</ref>, not to mention speeding up Hamilton's own political decline.<ref>Chernow (2004)</ref>

Hamilton had apparently grown impatient with Adams and wanted a new president who was more amenable to his pro-federal goals. During Washington's presidency Hamilton had been able to influence the federal response to the Whiskey Rebellion (which threatened the government's authority to tax citizens). Hamilton suggested to Washington that he lead the New York State militia to quash the rebellion in Pennsylvania. The Whiskey Rebellion infuriated Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson who felt the government was abusing its power against the rights of the citizens. When Washington announced that he would not seek a third term this prompted Hamilton to support VP John Adams in the 1796 election. 

Hamilton appears to have hoped in 1796 that his influence within an Adams administration would be as great or greater than in Washington's. By 1800, Hamilton had come to realize that Adams was too independent and chose to support Charles Pinckney of South Carolina. Given Pickney's lack of political experience he would have been likely to be open to Hamilton's influence. However, Hamilton's plan backfired and the split in the Federalist party allowed the Democratic Republicans to win in 1800. 

==== Selection method changes ====

Partisans on both sides sought any advantage they could find. In several states, this included changing the method of selection to ensure the desired result. In Georgia, Democratic-Republican legislators replaced the popular vote with selection by the state legislature. Federalist legislators did the same in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. (This may have had some unintended consequences in Massachusetts, where the delegation to the federal House of Representatives was changed from 12–2 Federalist to 8–6 Federalist by irate voters.) Pennsylvania also switched to legislative choice, but this resulted in an almost evenly split set of electors. Virginia switched from electoral districts to winner-take-all, a move that probably switched one or two votes from the Federalist column to the Democratic-Republican column.

=== Voting ===

Each state could choose its own election day, voting lasted from April to October. In April, Burr succeeded in reversing the Federalist majority and getting a Democratic-Republican majority in New York's state legislature. With the Federalists and Democratic-Republicans tied 65–65 in the Electoral College, the last state to vote, South Carolina, chose eight Democratic-Republicans, giving the election to Jefferson and Burr.

Under the United States Constitution, each Presidential elector cast two votes, without distinction as to which was for President or Vice President. The recipient of a majority of votes was elected President, while the Vice Presidency went to the recipient of the second greatest number of votes. The Federalists therefore had one of their electors vote for John Jay rather than for Vice Presidential candidate Pinckney. The Democratic-Republicans had a similar plan to have one of their electors cast a vote for another candidate instead of Burr, but, by a misadventure, failed to execute it. As a result, the Democratic-Republican electors each cast their two votes for Jefferson and Burr, giving each of them 73 votes. A contingent election had to be held in the outgoing, Federalist dominated, House of Representatives (the old House elected in 1798).<ref>Ferling (2004)</ref>

=== Disputes ===
==== Defective certificates ====

When the electoral ballots were opened and counted on February 11, 1801, it turned out that the certificate of election from Georgia was defective; while it was clear that the electors had cast their votes for Jefferson and Burr, the certificate did not take the Constitutionally mandated form of a "List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each." Jefferson, who was counting the votes in his role as President of the Senate, immediately counted the votes from Georgia as votes for Jefferson and Burr. No objections were raised. The total number of votes for Jefferson and Burr was 73, a majority.

=== Results ===

Jefferson and Burr tied for first place, so the election was thrown into the House of Representatives.
