'''AT&T Inc.''' () is the largest provider of both local and long distance telephone services, wireless service, and DSL Internet access in the United States with 71.4 million customers. In 2005, "Baby Bell" '''SBC Communications Inc.''' purchased former "Ma Bell" AT&T Corporation and then changed the name of the company after the merger to the more iconic AT&T moniker and the '''T''' stock-trading symbol (for "telephone"). 

The current AT&T includes eleven of the original Bell Operating Companies, and the original long distance division.<ref></ref> While it reconstitutes much of the former Bell System, AT&T Inc. lacks the vertical integration of the historic AT&T Corp. which prompted the antitrust suit and breakup in 1984. 

The company was honored at the 2008 Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for development of coaxial cable technology.

==History==
===Founding, expansion===
thumb|150px|Southwestern Bell Corporation logo, 1984–1995
AT&T Inc. was founded in 1983 as '''Southwestern Bell Corporation''', headquartered in Regional Bell Operating Companies, or "Baby Bells". The company — a holding company for Southwestern Bell Telephone Company was incorporated by AT&T Corporation as a result of U.S. antitrust action against their company in 1983. It took full control of Southwestern Bell Telephone on January 1, 1984.<ref>[http://www.porticus.org/bell/att_divestiture.html AT&T Divestiture. Bell System Memorial. Accessed May 18, 2008]</ref>

In 1993, Southwestern Bell Corp. moved its headquarters to San Antonio, Texas, and, during its annual meeting of stockholders in 1995, the company announced that its name would be changed to ''SBC Communications, Inc''. The name change was an effort to reinforce the company's national and global reach and the company stated not only that "SBC" was not an acronym for Southwestern Bell Corporation but also that it did not stand for anything at all.

SBC then proceeded (as permitted by the SNET (Southern New England Telephone).

SBC then announced plans to acquire Ameritech Wireless to GTE) to satisfy state and Federal regulators, the two merged on October 8, 1999. The FCC later fined SBC Communications $6 million for failure to comply with agreements made in order to secure approval of the merger. 

On November 1, 1999, SBC became a part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

'''AT&T''' ('''American Telephone & Telegraph''') is een Amerikaans San Antonio, Texas.

== Geschiedenis ==
AT&T is in FCC, zichzelf in verschillende delen opsplitsen om ervoor te zorgen dat het monopolie van het concern doorbroken werd.

De individuele "Baby Bells" groeiden uit tot grote concerns en enkele konden zich zelf meten met het post-fusie AT&T, waaronder SBC Communications. SBC, ontstaan uit "Baby Bell" Southwestern Bell Corporation, groeide snel door verschillende voormalige zusterbedrijven over te nemen. In 2005 kondigde het concern een overnamebod aan op voormalig moederbedrijf AT&T. Eind 2005 werd de overname voltooid en SBC Communications hernoemde zich hierna naar '''AT&T Inc.''' omdat die merknaam het meeste draagvlak had. Onderzoeken hebben uitgewezen dat bijna 95% van alle Amerikanen bekend zijn met de merknaam AT&T. Het nieuwe concern veranderde ook de beurscode aan de New York Stock Exchange van "SBC" naar het historisch beladen "T" (dat simpelweg staat voor "Telecom").
