'''"I'll Be There for You"''', performed by American sitcom ''Friends'', which premiered in 1994.  Although The Rembrandts write most of their own songs, this one was written specifically for the show by Michael Skloff and Allee Willis and was initially offered to They Might Be Giants and R.E.M.<ref>[http://tmbw.net/wiki/Trivia Trivia - TMBW: The They Might Be Giants Knowledge Base<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

After a looped the original short version into a full-length track and played it on the air, it became so popular that they had to record it. "Our record label said we had to finish the song and record it. There was no way to get out of it," lead singer Phil Sōlem said.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20041221174718/http://wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=1846556 Nashville DJ helped turn "Friends" song into radio hit<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The song made it onto ''L.P.'', the album The Rembrandts released in 1995, at the last moment. The song was not released as a single at first, a then common practice by record companies who feared it would cannibalize album sales.

The song topped the UK and reached number seventeen on the U.S. flipside to "This House is not a Home". It also reached #1 on the U.S. Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.

Rarely heard on UK radio after its early popularity, the song was frequently played on UK pop radio in 2004 around the time of the series finale.

The song was also ranked at #15 on ''Blender'' magazine's list of the "50 Worst Songs Ever".<ref>[http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=819 Run for Your Life!  It's the 50 Worst Songs Ever!] from ''Blender.com''</ref>
