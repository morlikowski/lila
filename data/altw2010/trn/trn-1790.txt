The '''1999 Canadian Grand Prix''' was a Formula One race held on June 13, 1999 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Canada. It was the sixth race of the 1999 Formula One season.

thumb|left|The race was won by [[Mika Häkkinen for McLaren.]]

Heinz-Harald Frentzen suffered a brake failure and had a massive crash with four laps to go. Frentzen was unhurt, but his crash caused this contest to be the only F1 race ever to finish behind the safety car[http://www.f1technical.net/articles/21].

The safety car was deployed four times in the race, which was a record at the time.

It was first deployed for a collision at the start involving Jarno Trulli, Jean Alesi and Rubens Barrichello - Trulli and Alesi had collided at the circuit on both attempts at starting the 1998 race.

The safety car returned to the track again when Ricardo Zonta hit what is now famously known as the "Wall of Champions".

Damon Hill and Michael Schumacher also slammed into the same wall before Jacques Villeneuve crashed there bringing out the safety car a third time.

After former F1 world champions FIA GT champion Ricardo Zonta all crashed at the same (final) corner, the concrete wall on the outside of the chicane (turn 15) got its nickname "Wall of Champions".[http://montreal.about.com/od/sportsrecreation/ig/Gilles-Villeneuve-Circuit/Is-this-the-Wall-of-Champions-.htm]
