==Plot==
During cleaning day at the Simpsons' house, the inane chatter of KBBL crackles in the background. The radio station's disc jockeys, Bill and Marty, are conducting the "KBBL Wants to Give You Something Stupid" radio contest, where a listener is called at random, and if he/she answers the phone with the phrase "KBBL's going to give me something stupid!" he/she wins either a gag prize or $10,000.

Bill and Marty call the Simpsons, and Bart immediately says the winning phrase. His choice – either a live African elephant or the cash. For Bart, the choice is easy ... the elephant. Bill and Marty are taken aback, especially since the intended prize was $10,000, and the fact they do not have an elephant. However, Bart insists that he wants an elephant, and everyone's attempts to reason with him fail.

Word spreads throughout town about Bill and Marty's refusal to make good on awarding the prize, prompting their boss to give them a choice: either arrange for delivery of Bart's elephant, or have their show replaced by an automated disc jockey. The disc jockeys decide on the former option.

Bart names his new elephant Stampy, and begins giving him undue attention while neglecting Snowball II. It is not long before Stampy eats the Simpsons out of house and home, and Lisa begins complaining that keeping an elephant as a pet – and thus, away from its native habitat - is cruel. In an effort to offset food costs, Bart and Homer exhibit Stampy by charging customers to pet and ride him, but they fail to make enough money to cover the elephant's food costs for one day. Homer and Marge decide that their house is unsuitable for an elephant to live in, and that Stampy is way too expensive to maintain as a pet, and tell the kids the elephant must go.

The family is visited by a representative of a poacher named Mr. Blackheart offers to buy Stampy. Homer wants to take the money, but Lisa is against the idea – particularly since Mr. Blackheart openly admits he plans to have Stampy killed for his ivory tusks. Just as Homer and Mr. Blackheart reach a deal, Bart plans to run away with Stampy. However, Stampy runs off, wreaking havoc throughout Springfield and is soon nowhere to be found. Bart begins looking for his elephant.

== Synopsis ==

Bart répond à l'émission de radio de Bill et Marty et gagne. Il a le choix entre choisir la récompense de 10 000 $ ou le cadeau-gag qui est un éléphant. Bart choisit ce dernier, mais comme personne ne choisit ce cadeau-gag en général, la station de radio n'est pas en mesure de lui en fournir un. La nouvelle se répand et l'audimat de l'émission chute. KBBL fait donc tout pour trouver un éléphant et surtout retrouver ses auditeurs. Bart finit par recevoir l'éléphant et prend vite conscience qu'il n'est absolument pas facile de s'en occuper et qu'il va coûter cher aux Simpson...
