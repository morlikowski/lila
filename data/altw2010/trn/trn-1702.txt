'''Mangal Pandey''' (c. Bengal Native Infantry (BNI) of the English East India Company. 

== Life ==

Pandey was born in the village of Nagwa in district Ballia (Bhumihar Brahmin family to Divakar Pandey of Surhupur village of Company of the 34th B.N.I. regiment and is primarily known for attacking the officers of that regiment in an incident that was the first act of what came to be known as the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 or the First War of Indian Independence. Mangal Pandey was a devout Hindu and he practiced his religion diligently.

== The 1857 Incident ==
At Barrackpore (now ''Barrackpur''), near Calcutta on March 29, 1857, in the afternoon, Lieutenant Baugh, Adjutant of the 34th Native Infantry, was informed that several men of his regiment were in an excited state. Further, it was reported to him that one of them, Mangal Pandey raged in front of the regiment's barracks on the parade ground, armed with a loaded musket, calling upon the men to rebel and threatening to shoot the first European he set his eyes on. Baugh immediately buckled on his sword, placed loaded pistols in his holsters, mounted his horse, and galloped to the lines. Pandey, who heard the hoof-beat of the approaching horse, took position behind the station gun, which was in front of the quarter-guard of the 34th, took aim at Baugh and fired. He missed Baugh, but the bullet struck his horse in the flank, and both horse and rider were brought down..<ref name="Malleson">[Source: "The Indian Mutiny of 1857", Col. G. B. Malleson, reprint 2005, Rupa & Co. Publishers, New Delhi] </ref> Baugh quickly disentangled himself, and, seizing one of his pistols, advanced towards Pandey and fired. He missed. Before Baugh could draw his sword, Pandey attacked him with a ''talwar'' (an Indian heavy sword) and closing with the adjutant, slashed him on the shoulder and neck and brought him to the ground. It was then that another sepoy, Shaikh Paltu, intervened and tried to restrain Pandey even as he tried to reload his musket.<ref name="Malleson"/>

The English Sergeant-Major, Hewson, had arrived on the ground, summoned by a native officer, prior to Baugh. He had ordered the ''jemadar'' in command of the quarter-guard to arrest Mangal Pandey. To this, the ''jemadar'' expostulated that he could not take Pandey on alone. At this, Hewson ordered him to fall in his guard with loaded weapons. In the meantime, Baugh had arrived on the field shouting 'Where is he? Where is he?' Hewson  called out to Baugh, 'Ride to the right, Sir, for your life. The sepoy will fire at you!' <ref name="Hibbert">[Source: "The Great Mutiny", Christopher Hibbert, 1978, Penguin Books] </ref> At that point Pandey fired, with the consequences outlined in the last paragraph. 

Hewson had charged towards Pandey as he was fighting with Lieutenant Baugh. He then locked in combat with Pandey and was knocked to the ground from behind by a blow from Pandey's musket.  The sound of the firing had brought other sepoys from the barracks; they remained mute spectators.  At this juncture, Shaikh Paltu, while trying to defend the two Englishmen called upon the other sepoys to assist him.<ref name="Malleson"/> Assailed by other sepoys, who threw stones and shoes at his back, he called on the guard to help him hold Pandey, but they threatened to shoot him if he did not let go of Pandey. <ref name="Hibbert"/>

On the order of the Jemadar of the troops, a man called Ishwari Prasad, the sepoys advanced and struck at the two prostrate officers. They then threatened Shaikh Paltu and ordered him to release Pandey, whom he had been vainly trying to hold back. However, Paltu, continued to hold Pandey until Baugh and the sergeant-major had had time to rise. <ref name="Malleson"/> Himself wounded by now, Paltu was obliged to loosen his grip. He backed away in one direction and Baugh and Hewson in another, while being struck with the butt ends of the guards' muskets.

In the meantime, report of the incident had been carried to the commanding officer General Hearsey, who then galloped to the ground with his two sons. Taking in the scene, he rode up to the guard, drew his pistol and ordered them to do their duty by seizing Mangal Pandey. The General threatened to shoot the first man that disobeyed. The men of the guard fell in, and followed Hearsey in the direction where Pandey was still ranting and raving. Pandey, then realizing the situation he had put himself in, put the muzzle of the musket to his breast and discharged it by pressing the trigger with his foot. He collapsed burned and bleeding but not mortally wounded.<ref name="Malleson"/>

He recovered, was brought to trial less than a week later. When asked whether he had been under the influence of any substances, he admitted to having used ''bhang'' (cannabis) and opium of late. He pleaded to not knowing what he was doing when intoxicated. He stated steadfastly that he had mutinied on his own accord and that none had played any role in egging him on. When asked to defend himself, he said "I did not know what I was doing. I did not know who I wounded and who I did not. What more shall I say? I have nothing more to say. I have no evidence." <ref name="Hibbert"/> He was sentenced to death by hanging along with the Jemadar. His execution was scheduled for April 18, but was carried out ten days prior to that date. The Jemadar Ishwari Prasad joined him on the gallows on April 21. <ref name="Malleson"/>

The 34th N.I. Regiment was disbanded "with disgrace" on Havaldar (native sergeant) by General Hearsey, for his gallant conduct. .<ref name="Malleson"/>

===Motivation===

The primary motivation behind Mangal Pandey's behaviour is attributed to a new type of bullet cartridge used in the Enfield P-53 rifle which was to be introduced in the Bengal Army that year.

The cartridge was rumoured to having been greased with animal fat (primarily pig fat and cow fat, which animals are not consumed by Muslims and Hindus respectively, the former being abhorrent to Muslims and the latter a holy animal of the Hindus).<ref>Proceedings of a Special Court of Inquiry concerning the Native Infantry, 6 February 1857 [http://projectsouthasia.sdstate.edu/docs/history/primarydocs/War%20of%201857/Indian%20Mutiny--Ch1/letter%208.htm Archives of Project South Angel, Missouri Southern State University]</ref> The cartridges had to be bitten at one end prior to use.<ref>Memorandum from Lieutenant and Brevet-Captain J. A. Wright to the Adjutant of the Rife Instruction Depot concerning the reaction of the Indian soldiers to the Enfield cartridges, 22 January 1857 [http://projectsouthasia.sdstate.edu/docs/history/primarydocs/War%20of%201857/Indian%20Mutiny--Ch1/letter%203.htm Archives of Project South Angel, Missouri Southern State University].</ref> The mutineers were of the opinion that this was an intentional act of the British, with the aim of defiling their religions.

Commandant Wheeler of the 34th BNI was known as a zealous Christian preacher, and this may also have impacted the Company's behaviour. The husband of Captain Wilma Halliday of 56th BNI had the Bible printed in Urdu and Nagri and distributed among the sepoys, thus raising suspicions amongst them that the British were intent on converting them to Christianity.<ref>Memorandum from Major-General J. B. Hearsey to Major W. A. J. Mayhew concerning the rumor that sepoys must embrace Christianity, 28 January 1857 [http://projectsouthasia.sdstate.edu/docs/history/primarydocs/War%20of%201857/Indian%20Mutiny--Ch1/letter%205.htm Archives of Project South Angel, Missouri Southern State University]</ref>

Also, the 19th and 34th Native Infantry were stationed at Lucknow during the time of annexation of Oudh for mis-government by the Nawab on February 7, 1856. The annexation had another implication for sepoys in the Bengal Army (a significant portion of whom came from that princely state). Before the annexation, these sepoys had the right to petition the British Resident at Lucknow for justice—a significant privilege in the context of native courts. As a result of the annexation, they lost that right, since that state no longer existed. Moreover, this action was seen by the residents of the state as an affront to their honour, the annexation being done in violation of an existing treaty.

Thus, it was quite natural that sepoys were affected by the general discontent which had been stirred up by the annexation. In February 1857, both these regiments were situated in Barrackpore.

The 19th Native Infantry Regiment is important because it was the regiment charged with testing the new cartridges on February 26, 1857. However, right up to the mutiny the guns had not been issued to them and the cartridges in the magazine of the regiment were as free of grease as they had been through the preceding half century. However, the paper used in wrapping the cartridges was of a different colour, arousing suspicions. The non-commissioned officers of the regiment refused to accept the cartridges on the 26 February. This information being conveyed to the commanding officer, Colonel Mitchell, he took it upon himself to try to convince the sepoys that the cartridges were no different from those they had been accustomed to and that they need not bite it. He concluded his exhortation with an appeal to the native officers to uphold the honour of the regiment and a threat to court-martial such sepoys as refused to accept the cartridge. However, the next morning the regiment rose in rebellion and it was only due to the persuasive powers of Colonel Mitchell and his sagacity that the sepoys were convinced to return to their barracks. A Court of Enquiry was ordered which after an investigation lasting nearly a month, recommended the disbanding of the regiment. The same was carried out on the 31 March. The 19th N.I. Regiment, far from being dismissed with dishonour, as is held by some, were allowed to retain their uniforms and provided by the Government with an allowance to return home.

====The Enfield Rifle and Cartridge====

The P-53 was officially known as the Rifle Musket.  Introduced in the British Army by the War Department during 1854 in the Crimean War, they proved very effective at a range of 50 to .  It was introduced in the Bengal Army by the East India Company in early-1857.

The rifle used a Metford-Pritchitt cartridge that required the use of a heavy paper tube containing 2½ drams (68 grains) of musket powder and a , pure lead bullet.  As the bullet incorporated no annular grease rings like the French and American minié ball bullets introduced in 1847, it was wrapped with a strip of greased paper to facilitate loading.  The cartridge itself was covered with a thin mixture of beeswax and mutton tallow for waterproofing.
