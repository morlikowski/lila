'''Avalon Airport'''  is an Avalon, Victoria, Geelong, and is 50 kilometres to the southwest of the state's capital city of Melbourne.

The airport is designed to cater for jet aircraft, and comprises a single runway. It is used for scheduled services by Jetstar Airways, and as a heavy maintenance facility by Jetstar's parent company, Qantas.<ref></ref> It is also the site of the biennial Australian International Airshow.  Currently, air traffic control is only provided on request, but on May 16, 2008 it was announced that regular air traffic control facilities would now be provided at Avalon. <ref>http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,23705288-23349,00.html?from=public_rss</ref>

The land on which Avalon Airport lies is part of the Lara Lea escarpment which is bounded by the You Yangs, Corio Bay and Melbourne Water sewage treatment agistment paddocks. The airport continues to fall under the jurisdiction of the Australian Department of Defence.

==History==
===Aircraft construction===
Avalon Airport was opened in 1953, to cater for the production of military aircraft.<ref>{{cite web

Previously the Government Aircraft Factory located at Fishermans Bend, Melbourne,  had used a runway beside their factory. However, newer jet aircraft required a longer runway length for safe operations, and the Fishermans Bend runway was being encroached upon by development. Land near Lara was purchased by the Commonwealth Government for a new facility. The site of the airport was originally part of the Avalon homestead and sheep station.

A 10000 ft (3075 m) runway was built by Canberra jet bomber was under construction at same time at the new airport.

In 1985 the Government Aircraft Factory changed its name to Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA).<ref></ref> Aircraft produced during this time had included the Sabre jet fighter, Nomad civil aircraft. Under the ASTA banner engines for the Dassault Mirage III jet fighters were produced, as well as assembly of the F/A-18 fighter jets for the RAAF.

October 1988 saw ASTA Aircraft Services division take delivery of the first Boeing 747 to Avalon for servicing and maintenance. By December 1993 fifty 747 aircraft had been through the Avalon facility, and 820 people were employed at the site.<ref></ref> 

On 27 June 1995 Aerospace Technologies of Australia was privatised by the Commonwealth Government, <ref></ref> selling the aircraft divisions to Rockwell Australia Limited, and the airport operations to Avalon Airport Geelong Pty Ltd.<ref></ref> The ASTA airliner overhauling facility was closed in 1997.<ref></ref>

===Pilot training===
In 1959, Qantas established a training base at the site, and the runway was extended to cater for jet aircraft, becoming for some years, the longest in the Southern Hemisphere. 

Training of pilots from Japan's All Nippon Airways commenced at Avalon on September 8, 1993.<ref></ref> 

===Hazelton Airlines===
Hazelton Airlines commenced flights between Avalon Airport and Sydney in February 1995. 36 seat SAAB 340 aircraft were used for the service. <ref></ref> The service was discontinued after a short time due to a lack of patronage.

===Private ownership===
In 1997 the Australian government decided Avalon was no longer needed and it was leased to Linfox, a company owned by transport tycoon Lindsay Fox.

===Scheduled passenger flights===
