'''Maartin Allcock''' (born Middleton, Manchester, England) is a multi-instrumentalist, known mainly as a bass-player, although he is known for being adept at any non-bowed stringed instrument.

Martin Allcock (the original spelling) studied music at Huddersfield and Leeds. His first real tour was with Mike Harding as one of the Brown Ale Cowboys (MH being Captain Paralytic - a spoof on the then-recent Elton John album Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboys). After a short tour in Brittany he discovered the joy of cooking (he stayed for a long time after the tour). On returning, eventually, to Manchester, he studied and qualified to become a chef, then worked in that rôle in the Shetlands in 1980. In 1981 he joined the Jethro Tull (1988-1991) and a session career which has included more than 200 albums. In 1991 he was in the unusual position of playing with three bands concurrently - The Mission, Jethro Tull and Fairport Convention.

Since leaving Fairport Convention at the end of 1996, he has enjoyed freelance work with many different artists. In 2000 he moved to Snowdonia. Currently he is becoming known as a producer in Welsh music as well as being a third (with guitarist Kevin Dempsey) of legendary fiddler Dave Swarbrick's trio Swarb's Lazarus. Maart is also UK bass player/tour manager for Nashville songwriter Beth Nielsen Chapman.
