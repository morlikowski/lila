==Career==
In 1969, while still a pupil at the capital's National Theatre at the age of 24, but became increasingly interested in the medium of ATV),  ''Caught on a Train'' (1980 - BBC2 ''Playhouse'') starring Peggy Ashcroft, and ''Soft Targets'' (1982 - ''Play for Today''). There were also TV adaptations of his stage plays ''Hitting Town'' (1976 - Thames Television/ITV ''Play for Britain'') and ''City Sugar'' (1978 - Scottish Television/ITV ''The Sunday Drama'').

Poliakoff's first Close My Eyes'' (1991), starring The Tribe'' (1998) starring Joely Richardson and Jeremy Northam, the latter eventually screened on BBC2 in the absence of a cinema distribution deal. 

He subsequently returned to his favoured form, television, this time choosing a flexible serial format resulting in the   acclaimed and Perfect Strangers'' (2001), a family drama starring Matthew Macfadyen, Michael Gambon and Lindsay Duncan, and  ''The Lost Prince'' (2003), a single drama recognised with an Emmy award rare for a non-American production, and featuring Miranda Richardson in a Golden Globe nominated performance, with Michael Gambon, Gina McKee and Tom Hollander. Late-2005 saw the one-off drama ''Friends and Crocodiles'' starring Damian Lewis and Jodhi May, with its overlapping companion-piece ''Gideon's Daughter'', starring Bill Nighy, Miranda Richardson and Emily Blunt, appearing early the following year. The latter won a Peabody Award in April 2007, with Golden Globes for its stars Nighy and Blunt.

In 2005, he renewed recent criticisms of BBC scheduling and commissioning policy, arguing that the reintroduction of a regular evening slot for one-off plays on BBC1 would provide the reinvigoration of drama output that has become a priority for the corporation.  

His latest drama ''Joe's Palace'' was screened on 4 November 2007 on BBC One and ''Capturing Mary'' was screened on BBC Two on 12 November 2007. ''The Culture Show'' also screened a Poliakoff special, including an interview between Poliakoff and Mark Kermode and a new TV play, ''A Real Summer'', on 10 November.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/11_november/09/poliakoff.shtml].
