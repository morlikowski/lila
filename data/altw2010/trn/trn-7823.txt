==单身女传教士==
1865年12月25日，金乐婷出生在英国兰开夏郡利物浦，父亲亨利·金尼斯牧师（Henry Grattan Guinness）是一位著名福音布道家，也是内地会创始人戴德生的好友。

金乐婷在青年时代在伦敦东区向女工教授圣经课，<!-- in Bromley-by-Bow--><!--  She attended meetings at "Berger Hall" named after William Thomas Berger. -->

1888年1月，22岁的金乐婷乘坐"Kaisar-i-Hind"号的二等舱，离开伦敦前往中国。一百名同工已经在前一年全部前往中国。属于寿阳宣教会的皮哥特一家与她同船，1900年在义和团事变期间被杀害。在锡兰的科伦坡，传教士们换乘驶往上海的"S.S. Deccan"号。当船只停靠马来亚的槟榔屿时，金乐婷首次接触到大批的华人。船只随后又停靠了 新加坡。船只在中国停靠的第一站是香港.<ref>Guinness (1889), 13</ref>最终抵达上海。但是上海并非他们的最终目的地，这些传教士只是在那里将欧洲装束改换成中国当地装束，就匆匆离开，启程沿长江向西北航行2天半时间，在1888年3月23日到达扬州。<ref>Guinness (1889), 36</ref>

金乐婷到达中国后不久写信给自己的妹妹： 

金乐婷接受语言训练之后，被分配到河南省传教。1894年，她与戴德生的次子（也是一名内地会传教士）戴存义（Frederick Howard Taylor）在上海结婚。

In her youth, Geraldine taught a Bible class for "factory-girls" in Bromley-by-Bow in the East End of London where they lived. She attended meetings at "Berger Hall" named after William Thomas Berger.

She left London for China as a second-class passenger on the P&amp;O vessel "Kaisar-i-Hind I"<ref name="kaisar">Shipping lists date the building of the second Kaisar-i-Hind after 1888 and upon the sinking of the first.</ref> in January, 1888, age 22. The Hundred missionaries had all sailed to China the previous year. Amongst the 25 passengers (16 men, 5 ladies [sic]) aboard the steam ship with her were Miss Mary Reed (daugther of Mrs Henry Reed and sister of Mrs Harry Guinness), Mr & Mrs Hunt (travelling to Hanchung)<ref>Guinness (1889), 39</ref> and the Pigott family of The Sheo Yang Mission (who were eventually killed during the Boxer Rebellion). 

As recorded in "In the Far East" the Kaisar-i-Hind took a route passing Gibraltar (10:30pm, 31 January 1888), calling at Naples and then passing the Straits of Messina; stopping for a day at Aden and then onward to Ceylon.

At Yang-tsi River to Yang-chau, finally arriving at Yang-chau on March 23, 1888.<ref>Guinness (1889), 36</ref>

She wrote to her sister after a short time in China: 

After training in China, Geraldine was eventually stationed in Honan Province.

==Legacy==
Geraldine Taylor's books have inspired generations of young missionaries such as Jim and Elizabeth Elliot to engage in overseas work. However, her writings have received some criticism for omitting some less favorable details of her subjects, specifically regarding the life of Hudson Taylor. Historians Ruth Tucker and John Pollock have noted with dismay the lack of detail given to Taylor's humanity and personal relationships. Writer Alvyn Austin bluntly accuses her of a "conspiracy of silence" about the workings of the mission. Alfred James Broomhall's perspective as the definitive historian of the CIM is more sympathetic, as he cites the need for prudence and tact that often motivated Geraldine's editorial decisions.
