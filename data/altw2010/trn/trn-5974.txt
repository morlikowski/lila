== 製作背景 ==
高校教師であったマレイ・バーネット（Murray Burnett）とジョアン・アリスン（Joan Alison）による上演されなかった戯曲「皆がリックの店にやってくる」は、スクリプトとしてワーナーに買われていたが製作のハル・B・ウォリスが映画化を企画した。監督のマイケル・カーティスはヨーロッパでのキャリアもあるユダヤ系ハンガリー人の職人肌。カメラ(メイン)のアーサー・エディソンは「西部戦線異状なし」(1930)でアカデミー撮影賞を受賞しているベテラン。脚本に参加したハワード・コッチはオーソン・ウェルズによるラジオ放送「宇宙戦争」に参加した劇作家である。

ハリウッドは以前からヨーロッパの映画産業から人材を引き抜いてきたが、この時代にも戦地を逃れた思想家、作家、写真家といった多くの人間が集まり互いに影響を与え合っていたとされる。本作の俳優もスウェーデン出身のバーグマン、イギリス出身のヘンリードがいる。ちなみに歌、挨拶、演説といった物語の筋と関係のない部分を除くとフランス人もドイツ人もモロッコ人も英語を話すため、この映画の基本的な言語は英語である。

ルーズベルト大統領を中心に政府機関トップを横断した『心理戦局』はその活動を始め、セクションの一つである陸軍も名匠フランク・キャプラが、プロパガンダ映画を作成している。

リベラル派の多かった戦時情報局(OWI)は1945年の戦争終了時に国務省に統合されることになる。前述の山本、里見は戦時情報局の沿革と活動について説明しているが、具体的にどのように本作が関連したかについては説明はない。

映画が製作された1940年代前半はスタジオ・システムと呼ばれた製作、配給、上映の資本統合が継続していたアメリカ映画産業の黄金期である。第二次世界大戦におけるアメリカのヨーロッパでの参戦を正当化することがあったといわれる。<ref>{{Cite book|和書

== ストーリー ==

第二次世界大戦のさなか、ヨーロッパ脱出をはかる難民であふれる、ドイツの占領下に陥ちたフランス植民地のモロッコの都市カサブランカ。

ある日、リック（ボガート）の経営する「カフェ・アメリカン」へ、反ナチス抵抗運動の指導者ヴィクター・ラズロ（ヘンリード）が訪れる。ラズロの同伴者である女性を一目見て息を呑むリック。彼女こそ、かつてパリで愛し合い、そして理由も告げずに彼のもとを去ったイルザ・ラント（バーグマン）だった。

当時フランスはドイツとその傀儡・ヴィシー政権に分割統治され、植民地であるモロッコもドイツ軍の勢力下に置かれていた。そのためドイツからその身を追われていたラズロは現地司令官であるドイツ陸軍のシュトラッサー少佐より出頭を命ぜられ事実上の出国禁止措置を取られてしまう。その上ラズロは、「カフェ・アメリカン」で我が物顔で軍歌を歌うドイツ兵に対抗して、当時対独抵抗のシンボル的な曲であったフランス国歌「ラ・マルセイエーズ」を客とともに歌い、その場に居合わせたシュトラッサーを激怒させる。

ラズロの身を案じたイルザは、リックがドイツの連絡員殺害の容疑で逮捕されたウーガーテから預かったままになっていた中立国への通行証を欲しいと頼み込む。リックは悩みつつも、結局ラズロとイルザのために、通行証を渡して、2人をドイツの手が及ばない中立国であるポルトガルのリスボンへ出発させる。それに気づき2人を空港で阻止しようとしたシュトラッサーをリックは射殺する。

フランス植民地警察のルノー署長は、表面上はドイツに対して協力的な姿勢を採っていたが、フランスを愛していて我が物顔に振舞うドイツ及びヴィシー政権に反感を持っており、ひそかに対独レジスタンスと連絡を取っていた。そこで、シュトラッサー少佐を殺害したリックを見てみぬ振りをし、レジスタンスの手で他のフランスの植民地に逃がしてやることにする。リックとルノーは肩を並べて宵闇に歩き去り、エンドタイトルとなる。

'''''Casablanca''''' (1942) is an American Vichy-controlled Moroccan city of Resistance leader husband escape from Casablanca to continue his fight against the Nazis.

Although it was an A-list movie, with established stars and first-rate writers &ndash; Howard Koch received credit for the screenplay &ndash; no one involved with its production expected ''Casablanca'' to be anything out of the ordinary;<ref></ref> it was just one of dozens of pictures being churned out by Hollywood every year. The film was a solid, if unspectacular, success in its initial run, rushed into release to take advantage of the publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier.<ref name="Stein interview"> Frank Miller: "There was a scene planned, after the ending, that would have shown Rick and Renault on an Allied ship just prior to the landing at CASABLANCA but plans to shoot it were scrapped when the marketing department realized they had to get the film out fast to capitalize on the liberation of North Africa."</ref> Yet, despite a changing assortment of screenwriters frantically adapting an unstaged play and barely keeping ahead of production, and Bogart attempting his first romantic lead role, ''Casablanca'' won three Best Picture. Its characters, dialogue, and music have become iconic, and ''Casablanca'' has grown in popularity to the point that it now consistently ranks near the top of lists of the greatest films of all time.

==Plot==
Rick Blaine (Bogart) is a bitter, cynical American Vichy French and Nazi officials, refugees and thieves. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, it is later revealed that he had run guns to 1935 Italian invasion, and fought on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War against Francisco Franco's Nationalists.

Ugarte (Peter Lorre), a petty criminal, arrives in Rick's club with "letters of transit"  obtained through the murder of two German couriers. The papers allow the bearer to travel freely around German-controlled Europe and to neutral Portugal, and from there to the New World. The letters are almost priceless to any of the continual stream of refugees who end up stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to make his fortune by selling them to the highest bidder, who is due to arrive at the club later that night. However, before the exchange can take place, Ugarte is arrested by the local police, under the command of Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains), a corrupt opportunist who says of himself, "I have no convictions ... I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy." Unbeknownst to Renault and the Nazis, Ugarte had entrusted the letters to Rick because "... somehow, just because you despise me, you are the only one I trust."

At this point, the reason for Rick's bitterness re-enters his life. His ex-lover Ilsa Lund (Czech Resistance leader long sought by the Nazis.  The couple need the letters to leave Casablanca to "reach America and continue [his] work." German Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) arrives to ensure that Laszlo does not succeed.

When Laszlo speaks with Signor Ferrari (Sidney Greenstreet), a major figure in the criminal underworld and Rick's business rival, Ferrari divulges his suspicion that Rick has the letters. Laszlo meets with Rick privately, but Rick refuses to part with the documents, telling Laszlo to ask his wife for the reason. They are interrupted when a group of Nazi officers led by Strasser begins to sing "Die Wacht am Rhein", a German patriotic song. Infuriated, Laszlo tells the house band to play "La Marseillaise", the French national anthem. When the band leader looks to Rick for permission, he nods his head. Laszlo starts singing, alone at first, then long-suppressed patriotic fervor grips the crowd and everyone joins in, drowning out the Germans. In retaliation, Strasser orders Renault to close the club.

right|thumb|265px|From left to right: Victor Laszlo, Ilsa Lund, Captain Renault and Rick Blaine
That night, Ilsa confronts Rick in the deserted cafe. When he refuses to give her the letters, she threatens him with a gun, but is unable to shoot, confessing that she still loves him. She explains that when she first met and fell in love with him in Paris, she believed that her husband had been killed trying to escape from a Nazi concentration camp. Later, with the German army on the verge of capturing the city, she learned that Laszlo was in fact alive and in hiding. She left Rick without explanation to tend to an ill Laszlo. 

With the revelation, Rick's bitterness dissolves and the lovers are reconciled. Rick agrees to help, leading her to believe that she will stay behind with him when Laszlo leaves. When Laszlo unexpectedly shows up, after having narrowly escaped a police raid on a Resistance meeting, Rick has Ilsa hide while the two men talk.

Laszlo reveals that he is aware of Rick's love for Ilsa and tries to get Rick to use the letters to take her to safety. However, the police arrive and arrest Laszlo on a petty charge. Rick convinces Renault to release Laszlo by promising to set him up for a much more serious crime: possession of the letters of transit. To allay Renault's suspicions about his motives, Rick explains that he and Ilsa will be leaving for America.

However, when Renault tries to arrest Laszlo for accepting the letters, Rick double crosses Renault, forcing him at gunpoint to assist in the escape. At the last moment, Rick makes Ilsa board the plane to Lisbon with her husband, telling her that she would regret it if she stayed. "Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life."

Major Strasser drives up by himself, having been tipped off by Renault, but Rick shoots him when he tries to intervene. When police reinforcements arrive, Renault considers, then tells his men to "Round up the usual suspects."  Once alone, Renault suggests that he and Rick leave Casablanca and join the Free French at Brazzaville. They walk off into the fog with one of the most memorable exit lines in movie history: "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."

==Production==
The film was based on play ''Everybody Comes to Rick's''.<ref></ref> The producer Algiers''.<ref>Harmetz, p. 30</ref>
Shooting began on May 25, 1942 and was completed on August 3. The film cost a total of $1,039,000 ($75,000 over budget),<ref name="robertson"></ref> not exceptionally high, but above average for the time.<ref>Behlmer, p. 208</ref>

The entire picture was shot in the studio, except for the sequence showing Major Strasser's arrival, which was filmed at redressed for the flashbacks. It remained on the Warners extras and a proportionate cardboard plane. Fog was used to mask the model's unconvincing appearance.<ref>Harmetz, p. 237</ref> Nevertheless, the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Orlando, Florida purchased a Lockheed 12A for its Great Movie Ride attraction, and initially claimed that it was the actual plane used in the film.<ref></ref> Film critic Roger Ebert calls Wallis the "key creative force" for his attention to the details of production (down to insisting on a real parrot in the Blue Parrot bar).<ref name="Ebertcommentary">Ebert, Roger. Commentary to ''Casablanca'' (Two-Disc Special Edition DVD).</ref>

Bergman's height caused some problems. She was some two&nbsp;inches (5&nbsp;cm) taller than Bogart, and claimed Curtiz had Bogart stand on blocks or sit on cushions in their scenes together.<ref>Harmetz, p.170</ref>

Wallis wrote the final line ("Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship") after shooting had been completed. Bogart had to be called in a month after the end of filming to dub it.

Later, there were plans for a further scene, showing Rick, Renault and a detachment of Free French soldiers on a ship, to incorporate the Allies' 1942 invasion of North Africa; however it proved too difficult to get Claude Rains for the shoot, and the scene was finally abandoned after David O. Selznick judged "it would be a terrible mistake to change the ending."<ref>Harmetz, pp. 280–81</ref>

===Writing===
The original play was inspired by a 1938 trip to Europe by Murray Burnett, during which he visited Vienna shortly after the Anschluss, as well as the south coast of France, which had uneasily coexisting populations of Nazis and refugees. The latter locale provided the inspirations for both Rick's cafe (the nightclub Le Kat Ferrat) and the character of Sam (a black piano player Burnett saw in Juan-les-Pins).<ref>Harmetz, p.53–54</ref> In the play, the Ilsa character was an American named Lois Meredith and did not meet Laszlo until after her relationship with Rick in Paris had ended; Rick was a lawyer.

The first writers to work on the script were the Epstein twins, Julius and Philip, who removed Rick's background and added more elements of comedy. The other credited writer, Howard Koch, came later, but worked in parallel with them, despite their differing emphases; Koch highlighted the political and melodramatic elements.<ref>Harmetz, pp.56–59</ref> The uncredited Casey Robinson contributed to the series of meetings between Rick and Ilsa in the cafe.<ref>Harmetz, pp.175 and 179</ref> Curtiz seems to have favored the romantic parts, insisting on retaining the Paris flashbacks. Despite the many writers, the film has what Ebert describes as a "wonderfully unified and consistent" script. Koch later claimed it was the tension between his own approach and Curtiz's which accounted for this: "Surprisingly, these disparate approaches somehow meshed, and perhaps it was partly this tug of war between Curtiz and me that gave the film a certain balance."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1991/8/1991_8_92.shtml
| last = Sorel | first = Edward | title = Casablanca | publisher = ''American Heritage'' magazine | date = December 1991|accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> Julius Epstein would later note the screenplay contained "more corn than in the states of Kansas and Iowa combined. But when corn works, there's nothing better."<ref></ref>

The film ran into some trouble from Joseph Breen of the Production Code Administration (the Hollywood self-censorship body), who opposed the suggestions that Captain Renault extorted sexual favors from his supplicants, and that Rick and Ilsa had slept together in Paris. Both, however, remained strongly implied in the finished version.<ref>Harmetz, pp.162–166 and Behlmer, pp.207–208 and 212–213</ref>

===Direction===
Wallis' first choice for director was Hungarian Jewish émigré; he had come to the U.S. in the 1920s, but some of his family were refugees from Nazi Europe.  
Roger Ebert has commented that in ''Casablanca'' "very few shots ... are memorable as shots", Curtiz being concerned to use images to tell the story rather than for their own sake.<ref name="Ebertcommentary" />  However, he had relatively little input into the development of the plot: Casey Robinson said Curtiz "knew nothing whatever about story... he saw it in pictures, and you supplied the stories".<ref name="Ebertcommentaryquote">Quoted in Ebert commentary.</ref> Critic Andrew Sarris called the film "the most decisive exception to the auteur theory",<ref>Sarris, Andrew (1968). ''The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968'' (New York: Dutton, 1968), p.176.</ref> to which Aljean Harmetz responded, "nearly every Warner Bros. picture was an exception to the auteur theory".<ref>Harmetz, p.75</ref> Other critics give more credit to Curtiz; Sidney Rosenzweig, in his study of the director's work, sees the film as a typical example of Curtiz's highlighting of moral dilemmas.<ref></ref> 

The montages, such as the opening sequence of the refugee trail and that showing the invasion of France, were directed by Don Siegel.<ref>Harmetz, p.264</ref>

===Cinematography===
right|thumb|100px|The [[Cross of Lorraine, emblem of the Free French.]]

The The Maltese Falcon'' and ''Frankenstein''. Particular attention was paid to photographing Bergman. She was shot mainly from her preferred left side, often with a softening gauze filter and with catch lights to make her eyes sparkle; the whole effect was designed to make her face seem "ineffably sad and tender and nostalgic".<ref name="Ebertcommentary" />  Bars of shadow across the characters and in the background variously imply imprisonment, the crucifix, the symbol of the Free French and emotional turmoil.<ref name="Ebertcommentary" />  Dark ''film noir'' and expressionist lighting is used in several scenes, particularly towards the end of the picture. Rosenzweig argues these shadow and lighting effects are classic elements of the Curtiz style, along with the fluid camera work and the use of the environment as a framing device.<ref>Rosenzweig, pp.6–7</ref>

===Music===
The music was written by score for ''Gone with the Wind''. The song "As Time Goes By" by For Whom the Bell Tolls'') and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song,<ref>"As Time Goes By" enjoyed a resurgence after the release of ''Casablanca'', spending 21 weeks on the French national anthem, transforming them to reflect changing moods.<ref>Harmetz, pp. 253–58</ref>

Particularly notable is the "duel of the songs". At Rick's cafe Strasser and a small group of his officers start singing "''Die Wacht am Rhein''" ("The Watch on the Rhine") around Sam's piano. At the behest of Laszlo, the band at Rick's cafe start playing "La Marseillaise", this rouses the whole cafe to stand and sing defiantly against the Germans drowning them out. In the soundtrack the "La Marseillaise" is played by a full orchestra. Originally, the piece intended for this iconic sequence was the "Horst Wessel Lied", the ''de facto'' second national anthem of Nazi Germany, but this was still under international copyright in non-Allied countries. 

Other songs in the film include "It Had to Be You" from 1924 (music by "Knock on Wood" (music by "Shine" from 1910 (music by Ford Dabney, lyrics by Cecil Mack and Lew Brown).

==Cast==
The cast is notable for its internationalism: only three of the credited actors were born in the U.S. The top-billed actors were:

*'''typecast as a High Sierra'' (1941) had allowed him to play a character with some warmth, but Rick was his first truly romantic role. 

*'''Swedish actress's Intermezzo'' had been well received, but her subsequent films were not major successes—until ''Casablanca''.   Ebert calls her "luminous", and comments on the chemistry between her and Bogart: "she paints his face with her eyes".<ref name="Ebertcommentary" /> Other actresses considered for the role of Ilsa had included Ann Sheridan, Hedy Lamarr and Michèle Morgan; Wallis obtained the services of Bergman, who was contracted to David O. Selznick, by loaning Olivia de Havilland in exchange.<ref>Harmetz, pp. 88, 89, 92, 95</ref> 

*'''Paul Henreid''' as '''Victor Laszlo'''. Henreid, an Austrian actor who left Austria in 1935, was reluctant to take the role (it "set [him] as a stiff forever", according to Pauline Kael<ref>Harmetz, p. 99</ref>), until he was promised top billing along with Bogart and Bergman. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors; he considered Bogart "a mediocre actor", while Bergman called Henreid a "prima donna".<ref>Harmetz, p. 97</ref> 

The second-billed actors were:

*'''English actor, born in The Adventures of Robin Hood''.
right|thumb|225px|Sidney Greenstreet (left) alongside Humphrey Bogart.
*'''Sydney Greenstreet''' as '''Signor Ferrari''', a rival clubowner. Another Englishman, Greenstreet had previously starred with Lorre and Bogart in his film debut in ''The Maltese Falcon''. 
*'''Peter Lorre''' as '''Signor Ugarte'''. Lorre was a Hungarian character actor who left Germany in 1933.
*'''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' (1920) before fleeing from the Nazis and ending his career playing Nazis in U.S. films.

Also credited were:

*'''Dooley Wilson''' as '''Sam'''. He was one of the few American members of the cast. A drummer, he could not play the piano. Hal Wallis had considered changing Sam to a female character (Hazel Scott and Ella Fitzgerald were candidates), and even after shooting had been completed, Wallis considered dubbing over Wilson's voice for the songs.<ref>Harmetz, pp. 139–40, 260 and Behlmer, p. 214</ref>
*'''Joy Page''' as '''Annina Brandel''', the young Bulgarian refugee. The third credited American, she was studio head Jack Warner's stepdaughter.
*'''Madeleine LeBeau''' as '''Yvonne''', Rick's soon-discarded girlfriend. The French actress was Marcel Dalio's wife until their divorce in 1942.
*'''S.Z. (or S. K.) "Cuddles" Sakall''' as '''Carl''', the waiter. He was a Hungarian actor who fled from Germany in 1939. A friend of Curtiz's since their days in Budapest, his three sisters died in a concentration camp.
*'''Curt Bois''' as the '''pickpocket'''. Bois was a German Jewish actor and another refugee. He may have a claim to the longest film career of any actor other than Mickey Rooney, making his first appearance in 1907 and his last in 1987.
*'''John Qualen''' as '''Berger''', Laszlo's Resistance contact. He was born in Canada, but grew up in America. He appeared in many of John Ford's movies.
*'''Leonid Kinskey''' as '''Sascha''', whom Rick assigns to escort Yvonne home. He was born in Russia.

Notable uncredited actors were:

* '''La Regle de Jeu'', but after he fled the fall of France, he was reduced to bit parts in Hollywood. He had a key role in another of Bogart's films, ''To Have and Have Not''.
* '''Helmut Dantine''' as '''Jan Brandel''', the Bulgarian roulette player. Another Austrian, he had spent time in a concentration camp after the Anschluss.
* '''Norma Varden''' as the befuddled Englishwoman whose husband has his wallet stolen. She was a famous English character actress.
* '''Jean Del Val''' as the French police radio announcer who opens ''Casablanca'' by reporting the news of the murder of the two German couriers.
* '''Torben Meyer''' a Dutch banker who is seated at a baccarat table in Rick's. He tells Carl, "Perhaps if you told him I ran the second largest banking house in Amsterdam." Meyer was a Danish actor.
* '''Dan Seymour''' as '''Abdul''', the doorman. He was an American actor, who at 265 pounds often played villains.
* '''Russian Revolution.

Part of the emotional impact of the film has been attributed to the large proportion of European exiles and refugees among the extras and in the minor roles. A witness to the filming of the "duel of the songs" sequence said he saw many of the actors crying, and "realized that they were all real refugees".<ref> Harmetz, p. 213</ref> Harmetz argues that they "brought to a dozen small roles in ''Casablanca'' an understanding and a desperation that could never have come from Central Casting".<ref>Harmetz, p. 214</ref> The German citizens among them nevertheless had to keep curfew as enemy aliens. Ironically, they were frequently cast as the Nazis from whom they had fled.

Some of the exiled foreign actors were:
* '''Wolfgang Zilzer''' who is shot in the opening scene of the movie, was a silent movie actor in Germany who left when the Nazis took over. He later married Casablanca actress Lotte Palfi.
* '''Hans Twardowski''' as a Nazi officer who argues with a French officer over Yvonne. Born in Stettin, Germany (today Szczecin, Poland), he fled Germany because he was a homosexual.
* '''Ludwig Stössel''' as '''Mr. Leuchtag''', the German refugee whose English is "not so good". Born in Austria, the Jewish actor was imprisoned following the Nazi Anschluss. When he was released, he left for England and then America. Stössel became famous for doing a long series of commercials for Italian Swiss Colony wine producers. Dressed in an Alpine hat and lederhosen, Stössel was their spokesman with the slogan, "That Little Old Winemaker, Me!"
* '''Ilka Grünig''' as '''Mrs. Leuchtag'''. Born in Vienna, she was a silent movie star in Germany who came to America after the Anschluss.
* '''Lotte Palfi''' as the refugee trying to sell her diamonds. Born in Germany, she played stage roles at a prestigious theater in Darmstadt, Germany. She journeyed to America after the Nazis came to power in 1933. She later married another Casablanca actor, Wolfgang Zilzer.
* '''Trude Berliner''' as a baccarat player in Rick's. Born in Berlin, she was a famous cabaret performer and film actress. Being Jewish, she left Germany in 1933.
* '''Louis V. Arco''' as another refugee in Rick's. Born Lutz Altschul in Austria, he moved to America shortly after the Anschluss and changed his name.
* '''Richard Ryen''' as Strasser's aide, '''Colonel Heinze'''. The Austrian Jew acted in German films, but fled the Nazis.
