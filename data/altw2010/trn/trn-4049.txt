'''''Castor et Pollux''''' (''librettist was Pierre-Joseph Justin Bernard. This was the third opera by Rameau and his second in the form of the ''tragédie en musique'' (if the lost ''Samson'' is discounted). Rameau made substantial cuts, alterations and added new material to the opera for its revival in 1754.<ref>''Viking'' p.834. The exact date of the revival is unknown, but was probably 8 or 11 June, 1754</ref> Experts still dispute which of the two versions is superior. Whatever the case, ''Castor et Pollux'' has always been regarded as one of Rameau's finest works.

==Performance history and reception==
''Castor et Pollux'' appeared in 1737 while the controversy ignited by Rameau's first opera ''Hippolyte et Aricie'' was still raging. Conservative critics held the works of the "father of French opera", Jean-Baptiste Lully, to be unsurpassable. They saw Rameau's radical musical innovations as an attack on all they held dear and a war of words broke out between these ''Lullistes'' and the supporters of the new composer, the so-called ''Rameauneurs''. This controversy ensured that the premiere of ''Castor'' would be a noteworthy event. As it turned out, the opera was a success.<ref>Bouissou pp.16-17</ref> It received twenty performances in late 1737 but did not reappear until the substantially revised version took to the stage in 1754. This time there were thirty performances and ten in 1755. Graham Sadler writes that "It was [...] ''Castor et Pollux'' that was regarded as Rameau's crowning achievement, at least from the time of its first revival (1754) onwards."<ref>''New Grove French Baroque Masters'' p.259</ref>

Revivals followed in 1764, 1765, 1772, 1773, 1778, 1779 and 1780. The taste for Rameau's operas did not long outlive the French Revolution but extracts from ''Castor et Pollux'' were still being performed in Paris as late as 1792. During the nineteenth century, the work did not appear on the French stage, though its fame survived the general obscurity into which Rameau's works had sunk; Hector Berlioz admiringly mentioned the aria ''Tristes apprêts''.<ref>Girdlestone p.205</ref> The first modern revival took place at the Schola Cantorum in Paris in 1903.<ref>Performance history: Girdlestone pp.230-31</ref> Among the audience was Claude Debussy.

==Synopsis==
''The synopsis is based on 1737 version''

===Prologue ===
The allegorical prologue is unrelated to the main story. It celebrates the Venus, goddess of love, subdues Mars, god of war, with the help of Minerva.

=== Act 1 ===
Background note: Castor and Pollux are famous heroes. Despite being twin brothers, one of them (Pollux) is immortal and the other (Castor) is mortal. They are both in love with the princess Telaira (Télaïre), but she loves only Castor. The twins have fought a war against an enemy king, Lynceus (Lyncée) which has resulted in disaster: Castor has been slain. The opera opens with his funeral rites. Telaira expresses her grief to her friend Phoebe (Phébé) in ''Tristes apprêts'', one of Rameau's most famous Jupiter, king of the gods, to restore Castor to life.

=== Act 2===
Pollux expresses his conflicting emotions in the aria ''Nature, amour, qui partagez mon coeur''. If he does what Telaira says and manages to persuade Jupiter to restore his brother to life, he knows he will lose the chance to marry her. But he finally yields to her pleas. Jupiter descends from above and Pollux begs him to bring Castor back to life. Jupiter replies he is powerless to alter the laws of fate. The only way to save Castor is for Pollux to take his place among the dead. Pollux, despairing that he will never win Telaira, decides to go to the Underworld. Jupiter tries dissuade him with a ballet of the Celestial Pleasures led by Hebe, goddess of youth, but Pollux is resolute.

=== Act 3===
The stage shows the entrance to the Underworld, guarded by monsters and demons. Phoebe gathers the Spartans to prevent Pollux from entering the gate of the Underworld. Pollux refuses to be dissuaded, even though Phoebe declares her love for him. When Telaira arrives and she sees Pollux's passion for her, Phoebe realises her love will be unrequited. She urges the demons of the Underworld to stop him entering (''Sortez, sortez d'esclavage/Combattez, Démons furieux''). Pollux fights the demons with the help of the god Mercury and descends into Hades.

'''Castor et Pollux''' on Pariisin Kuninkaallisessa musiikkiakatemiassa (Académie royale de musique). Teoksen libreton on kirjoittanut Pierre-Joseph Justin Bernard.

==Teos==
Kyseessä on Rameaun kolmas ooppera ja toinen musiikillinen tragediansa (tragédie en musique), kun kadonneeksi todettua oopperaa ''Samson'' ei lasketa mukaan. 

Rameau muutti melkoisesti oopperaa vuoden 8. tai 11. kesäkuuta vuonna 1754.</ref> Yhä vieläkin asiantuntijat kiistelevät versioiden keskinäisestä paremmuudesta. Kaikesta tästä huolimatta Castor et Pollux mainitaan eräänä tekijänsä parhaimpana oopperana.
