Amerika Birleşik Devletleri'nde 19. yüzyılın ortalarında geliştirilmiş bir iskambil oyunudur. Fransız oyunu [[bezikOyunda iki takım vardır. Ortaklar birbirleriyle karşılıklı olarak otururlar. Kağıt destesi özeldir ve toplam 80 karttan oluşur. Destede sinek, kara, maça ve kupa'nın asları, papazları, damları, valeleri ve onlarından dörder adet bulunur. Kartlar karıştırılır ve dağıtılır. Her bir oyuncunun elinde 20 kart bulunur. 

Oyunun amacı takımlardan birinin 500 puana ulaşmasıdır. Eğer her iki takımda aynı anda 500 puana ulaşırsa o elde ihaleyi alan takım oyunu kazanır. 

== Oyun ==

=== Konuşma ve Kozun Belirlenmesi ===

Dağıtanın solundan itibaren saatyönünde her oyuncu konuşur veya pas geçer. Her konuşma belli puanları içeren sayılardan oluşur. Açılış konuşması en az elli (50) diyerek yapılır. İhale 60'a kadar birer birer arttırılır. Atmıştan sonra ihaleyi beşer beşer artırmak zorunludur. Örneğin 60 diyerek ihaleyi alan taraf o el en az 60 puan toplamak zorundadır.

Pas geçen oyuncu artık bir kere daha ihaleye katılamaz. Eğer ilk üç oyuncu pas geçerse dağıtan konuşmak zorundadır. 

En yüksek rakamı söyleyen kozu belirler. Belirlenen kozun içinde (örneğin kupa) mutlaka o serideki kız ve papaz bulunmak zorundadır. (Örnekte kız ve papazı). Bu duruma evlilik denir. Eğer ihaleyi alan (veya ihalenin üzerine kaldığı) kişinin elinde karo, maça, kupa veya sineğin herhangi birinden bir evlilik bulunmuyorsa ihaleyi alan taraf batar.

'''Pinochle''' (sometimes '''Pinocle''' or '''Penuchle'''), is a melds. Each hand is played in three phases: bidding, melds, and tricks.

A Pinochle deck consists of two copies of each of the 9, 10, jack, queen, king, and suits. Aces are always considered high. Pinochle follows the standard card ordering with the exception of the 10 being second highest. The complete ordering from highest to lowest is '''A, 10, K, Q, J, 9'''.

Variants of Pinochle can be played with three, five, six, eight or more players. These larger variations can combine two Pinochle decks called a "double deck".

In some areas of the United States, such as Oklahoma and Texas, thumb wrestling is often referred to as "pinochle". The two games, however, are not related.

== History ==

Pinochle derives from the game Bezique, which is virtually identical to the original two-handed version of Pinochle that is still played by some.  "Bezique" as pronounced by the French sounded similar to "besicles," or "spectacles."  The French word "Binocle" also meant "eyeglasses".  The word is also possibly derived from the French word, "binage", for the combination of cards called "binocle".<ref>Deborah Doyle (edited).  ''Hoyle's Official Rules of Card Games''. Redwood: Dingley. 2000. Page 420.</ref>  This latter pronunciation of the game would be adopted by German speakers. German immigrants brought the game to America, where it was later mispronounced and misspelled "Pinochle."<ref name="scarne1965">John Scarne.  ''Scarne on Cards''. Signet: New York. 1965. Pages 310-311.</ref>

Auction Pinochle for three players is a variation derived from combining Bezique and the German game Skat. Some mistakenly claim Pinochle derives from Hearts, and Spades derive from Whist, but the only thing Whist shares with Pinochle is the bidding concept, which Pinochle actually borrowed from Skat.

During World War I, the city of Syracuse, New York outlawed the playing of Pinochle in a fit of anti-German sentiment.<ref>Rensselaer County Historical Society.  ''Online Exhibitions:  "Grüß Gott" in Rensselaer County: The Twentieth Century''. 17 October 2002. Downloaded 12 February 2007.[http://www.rchsonline.org/grus_20th.htm]</ref>  Pinochle was the favorite card game of American Jews and Irish immigrants, while Skat was the preferred game of a majority of German immigrants.

== Dealing ==

The game is played with one or two Pinochle decks of 48 cards each; one player is the dealer.

In Pinochle, after the shuffle, the dealer (after offering a cut to the player on their right) distributes the cards. All the cards are dealt in partnership Pinochle (4,6, or 8 players). In other variations a ''widow''' (or called the "kitty", "talon", or "stock") of cards remain. Traditionally, this is done clockwise, either three or four cards at a time, starting with the player to the left and ending with the dealer. The deal rotates clockwise, so the dealer's left-hand opponent will deal next.

A common house rule is that if a player receives 4 nines and no Aces, or 5 nines and only one Ace, they can toss in their hand and declare a misdeal; the cards are then re-dealt by the same dealer.

== The auction ==

In auction Pinochle, players bid for the points they predict their hand could earn. The highest bidder earns the right to declare the trump suit. One of the players, usually the player to the left of the dealer, or the dealer themselves, is obligated to open with a first bid. The size of bids is based on the point scale used; traditionally, points are in multiples of 10, thus a minimum opening bid might be agreed to be 100<ref name="bicycle2004">Joli Kansil.  ''Bicycle Official Rules of Card Games''. 90th Edition. Cincinnati: US Playing Card Company. 2004. Page 208.</ref> or 250.<ref name="scarne1965">Page 344</ref> However, many alternate scoring rules drop the unnecessary trailing zero; in that case, bids of 10 and 25, respectively, have the same value. When a player has the turn to bid, the player may do either of the following:

# Make a new bid, or
# Pass.

Each bid must be greater than the previous one, and be a multiple of 10 or 25 (if playing without trailing zeroes, the bid must be one or two greater respectively). When a player passes, they can no longer bid. The auction ends when all subsequent players in rotation have passed after the last bid. The last bid becomes the ''contract''. The player that made this final bid will then declare trump in the suit that is desired. In some house rules, trump cannot be declared in any suit not containing a ''run'', ''marriage'' or ''dix'' meld.

In order to win the hand, the combined total of ''melding'' and ''trick'' points must be equal to or greater than the winning bid. Thus bidding involves anticipating the points that will be accumulated from melds and from the points acumulated from winning tricks. If the combined score is lower than the bid, then the bidding team or player has been ''set''. This means that the total bid amount is subtracted from the total game score, often accompanied by losing the points scored in meld for that hand as well. This can result in a negative score.<ref name="bicycle2004">Page 208</ref>

A related though different style of bidding is for the players to bid individually, and partners' bids are then summed. The winning bid only decides trump; both (or all) teams' bids become their contract, meaning any team can score or be set. This creates a more balanced game. A house rule often used with this style of bidding is that a player or partnership must have a minimum number of meld points (usually 20 or 200 depending on point scales) in order to bid, and if it is discovered that they do not, a mis-bid is declared and the team's contract is null, with or without a penalty.

==Passing cards==

After the bid has been taken and trump declared in a partnership game, the bid winning team exchanges cards. It may be three or four cards, depending on the version of the game. The partner of the bid winner passes first. The objective of the partner is either to add to the total points in meld or to pass trick-winning cards. After receiving the cards, the bid winner examines what will create the strongest hand and then discards 4 to their partner. A variation is for the bid winner and partner to exchange the designated number of cards simultaneously, or for no passing to occur.

== Melding ==

Melding consists of displaying specific combinations of cards to all players. Typically this is done by placing the combination of cards face up on the playing surface until all players have had the opportunity to examine them. All players meld after the bid winner shows meld first. The types of melds include '''arounds''', '''marriages''', '''flushes''' and '''pinochles'''.

The ''rank melds'' containing four of the same face cards &ndash; ace, king, queen or jack &ndash; must include one card from each of the different suits. They are scored as follows:

* "100 Aces" or "Aces around" - 4 aces of different suits - 100 points
* "80 Kings" or "Kings around" - 4 kings of different suits - 80 points
* "60 Queens" or "Queens around" - 4 queens of different suits - 60 points
* "40 Jacks" or "Jacks around" - 4 jacks of different suits - 40 points

A player holding all eight aces, kings, queens or jacks is called a double around (or double aces, double kings, etc). This hand is worth 10 times the value of a single around. For instance, a kings double around is worth 800 points.

The marriages, flush and dix are the ''suit melds''.

* "Trump Marriage" - king and queen of trump suit - 40 points
* "Marriage" - king and queen of a suit other than trump - 20 points
* "Flush", "Family", "Rope" or "Run" - '''A 10 K Q J''' of trump suit only - 150 points. Similar to what is done with Aces, Kings Around, etc. A double run, or two runs in trump in the same hand, is worth 1500 points.
* "Dix" - nine of trump - 10 points

A marriage in each suit is worth 240 total points. As a shortcut, this is called a "roundtable", "marriages around", "Round House", or a "Round Robin". This is nothing more than the sum of the marriages, plus kings around and queens around.

The pinochle is the unique combination that shares the name of the game.

* "Pinochle" - jack of diamonds and queen of spades - 40 points.
* "Double pinochle" - both jacks of diamonds and both queens of spades - 300 points.

In the most common form of the game (see variations below), any one card may be used in only one meld of each type. Thus, a queen card can be used in one marriage with one king, regardless if the player has the other king of the same suit. However, a queen can be used to score a marriage and a pinochle if the player also has the correct jack. 

After the melds are displayed, the points are counted and the teams total their individual meld scores to form a team score.

In some version of this game, additional melds are permitted.

* Three "legs" of pinochle &ndash; both jacks of diamonds and a queen of spades or a jack of diamonds and both queens of spades &ndash; is worth 150.
* An extra king or queen in a run is worth half a trump marriage, 20 points. In other versions, it is worth a full marriage, 40 points. Some variants allow both the king and queen to each count as a marriage in this fashion, others do not.

== Playing tricks ==

In playing cards for tricks, there are strict rules of forced play, which limit a player's ability to strategically retain high cards: The high bidder leads the play with the first card, which can be any card in the contract winner's hand, although some rules require the first card led to be a trump card. Then there are two variations of following suit depending if you are playing post-1945 or pre-1945 rules.

Pre-1945 rules: Every player must follow the lead suit if possible. Usually every player must play a winning card against those played so far, if it is possible to do so, even when the current player expects a later player to win the hand with a better card. The only exception is if a player played a trump card when trump was not the suit led. In that case, those following that player may play any card of the lead suit, since they must follow the lead suit but are already losing to the player who played trump. So if a player can play a card in suit, higher than any played so far, the player must do so, even if the player expects to lose to a later played card. Likewise, if a player cannot follow suit, but has trump, they must play trump. Again, if a player does not have any cards of the lead suit and can play a trump card higher than any other trump played so far, the player must do so, even if the player expects that a later player will beat the card. If another trump has already been played that a player cannot beat, then they can play any trump in their hand, but they still must play a trump card if they can. Only when a player has no cards in suit, and has no trump, can the player choose to play any card in their hand.

Post-1945 rules: Most books today say that unless trump is led you need not try to win the trick. It is only when trump is led that "heading" the trick is mandatory. In pinochle circles and tournaments the post-1945 rules are played about 50% of the time according to Pagat and Hoyle. <ref name="pagat.com">[http://www.pagat.com Card Games<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

If two identical cards are played, the first one outranks the second.

After the first trick, the winner of each trick leads the first card for the next trick, until all the cards are played.

== Scoring tricks ==
Points are scored based on the tricks won in the hand. There are several ways to count up the points for play, but they always add up to 250 points. The last trick is always worth 10 points. The classic counting system of Pinochle is where aces are worth 11, tens are worth 10, kings are worth 4, queens are worth 3, jacks are worth 2, and nines are worth zero. This method takes longer to count the score at the end of each hand. A simpler method is to count aces and tens for 10 points, kings and queens for 5 points, and jacks and nines are worth zero.  

An even simpler method that reduces strategy in trick-taking has aces, tens, and kings worth 10 (and known as  "counters"), and everything else zero ("garbage").  
Since all points are multiples of ten in the third method, some players drop the redundant zero. Aces, tens, and kings won in tricks are worth one point. The meld scoring can also avoid the zero in the tenth place. Melds like 100 aces are thus worth 10. The terms "100 aces", "80 kings" and so on are still used, even though the point values are one-tenth.
