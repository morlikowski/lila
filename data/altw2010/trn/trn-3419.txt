The '''Chrysler 180''' was the base name for a series of large saloon cars produced by Barreiros' factory in Spain. The Chrysler 180 was also the base for the medium-sized model built by Chrysler Australia model, the Chrysler Centura.

Depending on engine employed, the cars were marketed as '''Chrysler 160/180/2 litre''', and since 1977 in France and rest of continental Europe as '''Chrysler-Simca 1609/1610/2 litres'''. After the takeover of Chrysler Europe by diesel model was sold until 1982.

The large Chrysler fared quite poorly in the European markets. The replacement for the car was developed by Chrysler Europe under the codename ''C9'' and was finally launched by PSA as the even more ill-fated Talbot Tagora.<ref></ref>

== Development ==
Although Chrysler gradually took financial control of both Simca and Rootes Group during the 1960s, there was little effort to coordinate the operations of both automakers. Therefore, the first "common" European Chrysler car was actually a result of two separate development programmes.<ref name="rootes-development"></ref>

=== Rootes Group C Car ===
In 1966, under the direction of Roy Axe, the Head of Design, Rootes Group team started working on what was internally named the "'''''C Car'''''" (in reference to the smaller "''B car''", which became the Hillman Avenger), a new large car for Rootes to replace the Humber Hawk (and the imported Australian Chrysler Valiant, which served as a placeholder in Rootes' lineup after the Hawk's demise in 1967, without much success). In a typical Rootes fashion, the plan was to market the car under three brands - the base version as Hillman, a 2.0&nbsp;litre one as Sunbeam 2000, and atop the range a Humber Hawk with a 2.5&nbsp;litre engine. A further development of the C Car with a stretched platform was planned, a "''D Car''", which was to replace the Humber Super Snipe.<ref name="rootes-development"/>

The Rootes development programme also comprised the development of a brand-new V6 engine, with a 60° vee angle, with two versions of the abovementioned displacements of 2.0 and 2.5&nbsp;litres. There were four (Series IV, presumably) Humber Hawk- and some Hillman Avenger-bodied prototypes built to test the new engine. Some other design propositions included the use of De Dion tubes for rear suspension (like in the competing Rover P6), as well as a five-speed gearbox (which would still be a rather daring proposition at that time).<ref name="rootes-development"/>

=== Simca Projet 929 ===
At the same time, in France, Simca was working on '''''Projet 929''''', which would be Simca's first large car since the Vedette was cancelled in 1961, and also partially replace the Simca 1501 in its role of the range-topping Simca. The car would not use a V6 engine, as the displacement-based ''puissance fiscale'' tax system in France would make the costs prohibitive, but rather four-cylinder units of more modest specifications. There were three styling propositions prepared for the new car. The ''929 XA'' was styled by Simca's design team, featuring angular design and rather top-heavy proportions. Detroit design studios, and was very American in style, somewhat resembling a smaller version what later became the Australian VE Series Chrysler Valiant.<ref name="rootes-development"/><ref name="rootes-929"></ref>

=== The decision ===
In early 1969, Chrysler realized that there are actually two potentially competing cars being developed and called for both the British and the French proposition to be presented before the general management of Chrysler Europe. The decision was taken to go ahead with the British C Car programme, but to develop two versions for both the UK and the French part of the concern. Chrysler funded a new plant along with a development centre for the Rootes Group in Whitley, Coventry, where the development was continued. Roy Axe employed former Chrysler USA designer Curt Gwinn as project designer, and the C Car took a shape very similar to an enlarged version of Hillman Avenger. Initial designs were inspired by contemporary American Chryslers, with twin headlamps and a light bar in the rear.<ref name="rootes-development"/>

In 1970, however, Chrysler reviewed the programme once again and decided to trim it down to just one version, to be built in Simca's Poissy factory in France, for all markets. The responsibility for the programme was then passed in turn to Simca (where it became known internally as "'''Simca 1800'''"), who gave the car a different front end with rectangular single front lamps, as well as stripped the interior of some features proposed by the Rootes Group team, such as genuine wood and leather and £31 million of the £38 million of the programme budget was already spent, and the tooling for the new engine was already being installed in the Rootes' Humber Road factory. The car also ended up with more conventional coil sprung rear automatic).<ref name="rootes-development"/>

== Marketing ==
=== Launch ===
Following the renaming of Simca to "Chrysler France" and Rootes Group to "Chrysler UK" (which combined formed Chrysler Europe), the new large car was the first one to spearhead the concept of unifying the offerings from both sides of the Channel under the common brand. Thus, the vehicle was launched as Chrysler 160, '''160 GT''' and 180. In a fashion similar to Simca models, the designations referred to the displacement of the engines employed by the given version. The 160 employed the 1632&nbsp;cc unit, while the 180 came with the 1812&nbsp;cc one. A bit confusingly, the 160 GT came with the latter.<ref name="rootes-development"/>

The three models were introduced to the public at the 1970 Salon International d'Automobile under the slogan "American in Paris". The British launch took place in 1971, with only the 180 on offer. The 2.0&nbsp;litre model (marketed simply as "Chrysler 2 litre") joined the lineup for 1973, unveiled at the Amsterdam Auto Show in 1972 for the first time. The 1981&nbsp;cc unit was available solely with Chrysler's auxiliary driving lights and a small "2L" badge adorning the C-pillar. The 160 and 180 also gained some chrome and metal trim on the outside in 1972, and since the advent of the 2.0&nbsp;litre, all models featured 14&nbsp;inch (rather than previous 13&nbsp;inch) wheels and new hubcaps. The 160 GT was cancelled at the same time.<ref name="rootes-development"/>

C'est en octobre 1970, lors du salon de l'Automobile, que Simca présente les '''Chrysler 160''', '''160GT''' et '''180'''.
Ce nom Chrysler sèmera le trouble auprès des clients qui se demanderont si oui ou non il s'agit bien d'une vraie Simca ou d'une américaine aux dimensions européennes. Il est vrai que l'esthétique évoque plus les États-Unis que la France profonde favorisant ainsi la confusion dans les esprits.

La '''160''' est le modèle de base. 
C'est au niveau du moteur que Simca marque le pas sur les précédentes productions : course super carrée (alésage supérieur à la course), arbre à cames en tête entrainé par chaîne. Cette mécanique est d'emblée conçue pour subir de futurs augmentations de cylindrée. Simca n'hésitera pas à le faire comme nous le verrons plus bas.
Dotée d'un moteur &nbsp;cm de 80 ch (9 CV - 155 km/h), la 160 cible particulièrement les propriétaires de Simca 1301/1501 désireux de changer leurs autos pour un modèle de gamme supérieure. L'équipement est bien sur mesuré, même les butoirs de pare-chocs sont absents laissant seules les simples lames d'acier chromé (ils apparaitront un peu plus tard). Les freins sont à disques à l'avant et à tambours à l'arrière.

La '''180''', elle, bénéficie d'un traitement nettement plus flatteur, à commencer par la mécanique. Le moteur est extérieurement identique à celui de la 160, mais c'est sur la cylindrée que Simca a travaillé en la portant à &nbsp;cm. Ainsi modifié, sa puissance passe à 97 ch (10 CV) transformant ainsi la placide Chrysler en dévoreuse de bitume avec une vitesse de pointe de 170&nbsp;km/h. L'équipement proposé est plus riche : starter automatique, compte-tours, ornements intérieurs en faux bois, dégivrage de la lunette arrière, feux de recul, etc. Et surtout 4 freins à disques.

La '''160GT''' se voit dotée du moteur de la 180 et de l'équipement de la 160. La montre est alors remplacée par un compte-tours... "GT" oblige !
