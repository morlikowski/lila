'''''The Mirror Has Two Faces''''' is a 1996 American romantic dramedy film produced and directed by Barbra Streisand, who also stars. The screenplay by Richard LaGravenese is based on the 1958 French film ''Le Miroir à Deux Faces'' written by André Cayatte and Gérard Oury, which focused on a homely woman who becomes a beauty after plastic surgery, only to cause complications that result in her husband killing the doctor who performed the operation.

The film stars Streisand, Jeff Bridges, Pierce Brosnan, George Segal, Mimi Rogers, Brenda Vaccaro and Lauren Bacall.

The film received widespread criticism for being an ego production by Streisand who, with Robert John "Mutt" Lange, and "I Finally Found Someone", and sang it on the soundtrack with Adams. 

==Synopsis==
Rose Morgan (Streisand), a shy, plain, middle-aged English literature professor at Columbia University, shares a home with her vain, overbearing mother Hannah (Bacall). When her attractive sister Claire (Rogers) starts preparations for her wedding to Alex (Brosnan), Rose begins to feel her loveless life is empty.

Gregory Larkin (Bridges), a Columbia Mathematics teacher who feels sex complicates matters between men and women, is looking for a relationship based on the intellectual rather than the physical. When he overhears Rose's lecture about chaste love in literature, he becomes intrigued and asks her out, and is impressed by her wit and knowledge. He proposes marriage, with the condition it will be strictly platonic.  The prospect of spending the rest of her life as a lonely spinster living with her mother seems far worse than a marriage without sex, so Rose accepts.

Rose's attraction to Gregory grows, and one night she attempts to seduce him, much to his annoyance. When he departs on a lengthy lecture tour, Rose embarks on a crash course in self improvement. She diets, exercises, changes her hairstyle, learns to use makeup, and outfits herself in an updated wardrobe, and when her husband returns, he finds a very different woman waiting for him, and his perception of her begins to alter dramatically.

All the while Rose realizes that everyone, including herself, is behaving differently now towards her improved-self, though not always to her liking. Gregory and Rose finally face that their mutual love has not been hindered by Rose's appearance, but by Gregory's unusual theories on marriage and sex, and finally recognize their deep affection.

==Reception==
Fan reception was a disappointment. The film started out well generating $12,210,868 in the opening weekend ending November 17, 1996.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117057/business Business]. - ''The Mirror Has Two Faces''. - The Numbers. - Retrieved: 2008-07-12</ref>

In her review in the ''New York Times'', Janet Maslin called the film's first hour "light and amusing" but added, "Then [Barbra Streisand] demolishes her audience's good will with hubris that goes through the roof. Beguiling as she can be in ugly duckling roles, she becomes insufferable as this story's gloating swan . . . The overkill of ''The Mirror Has Two Faces'' is partly offset by Ms. Streisand's genuine diva appeal. The camera does love her, even with a gun to its head. And she's able to wring sympathy and humor from the first half of this role. The film also has a big asset in Ms. Bacall . . [who delivers] her lines with trademark tart panache . . . and cuts an elegant and sardonic figure".<ref name=MaslinJ-NYT-1996-11-15>Maslin, Janet. - Movie Review: "The Mirror Has Two Faces". - ''New York Times''. - November 15, 1996.</ref>

Roger Ebert of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' said the film "approaches the subject of marriage warily and with wit, like a George Bernard Shaw play . . . it's rare to find a film that deals intelligently with issues of sex and love, instead of just assuming that everyone on the screen and in the audience shares the same popular culture assumptions. It's rare, too, to find such verbal characters in a movie, and listening to them talk is one of the pleasures of ''The Mirror Has Two Faces'' . . . this is a moving and challenging movie".<ref name=EbertR-CST-1996-11-15>Ebert, Roger. - [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19961115/REVIEWS/611150303/1023 "The Mirror Has Two Faces"]. - ''Chicago Sun-Times''. - November 15, 1996.</ref>

In the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', Edward Guthmann described the film as "a silly affirmation fantasy . . . that Streisand  . . . uses to prove she's really beautiful, funny and worthy of being loved, gosh darn it . . . hasn't she returned to the theme of Homely Girl Redeemed, and crowned herself the victor, countless times? Look back and you'll see that Streisand's career, from the beginning, was one long battle cry for geeks and wallflowers and Jewish girls with big noses - a series of wish-fulfillment scenarios in which she, the perennial underdog, triumphs by dint of talent, chutzpah and a really great personality . . . in its first half ''The Mirror'' is a romantic-comic delight: nicely directed . . . well-acted by a terrific cast and peppered with great one-liners . . . by the second half . . . the movie has disintegrated into a humorless, drawn-out plea for reassurance".<ref name=GuthmannE-SFC-1996-11-15>Guthmann, Edward. - [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/11/15/DD70752.DTL "In Babs' Vanity Case, `Mirror' Has One Face: Streisand overdoes the ugly duckling bit"]. - ''San Francisco Chronicle''. - November 15, 1996.</ref>
