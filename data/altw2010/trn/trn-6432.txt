==Exhibits==

When visitors enter into the museum, they first take a long escalator down to the first floor of the basement. The basement only contains "Dino Street," a hallway displaying fossils of some of the earliest known life on Earth. A bone bed sits at the end of the hallway and is a replica of an actual site in USA.

From there, visitors can go up to the main exhibition hall, which is the museum's primary exhibition space and consists of dinosaur fossils. Though many of the dinosaur fossils are replicas, some displays use actual dinosaur fossils and visitors are allowed to touch some of the displays. Various dioramas,<ref name="chubu"/> including some with robotic dinosaurs that move and make sounds, also are used to show visitors a conceptual look at the dinosaurs' habitats.

The second floor contains exhibits focusing on earth sciences, including plate tectonics, rock formation and precious gems. The third floor focuses on the history of life, showing a timeline from the formation of the Earth up until modern times. In addition to the dinosaurs, this exhibit shows some of the earliest single-celled organisms and their evolution into the mammals of today.

The museum also contains a "Dino Lab," which has real fossils on display that visitors can feel and lift up. There is also a fossil cleaning room where visitors can watch actual fossils being cleaned and preserved.

There are also outdoor exhibits to compliment the main ones inside the museum. From the spring to the fall, visitors can experience excavation activities at a location on the park grounds. Additional replicas of dinosaurs and their fossils can be found throughout the park grounds.

'''福井県立恐竜博物館'''（ふくいけんりつ きょうりゅうはくぶつかん）は、福井県勝山市村岡町にある恐竜を主たるテーマとした自然科学系の博物館。

日本で唯一の恐竜を専門とする博物館である上に、中国の自貢恐竜博物館やカナダのロイヤル・ティレル古生物学博物館と並んで、世界三大恐竜博物館の一つである。

2000年11月23日にはカナダにあるロイヤル・ティレル古生物学博物館と姉妹館提携を結んだ。

勝山市が恐竜の発掘地であることから作られたもの。2000年夏に長尾山総合公園内で開催された恐竜エキスポ2000のメイン会場として、同年7月に開館した。敷地面積は約30,000㎡で日本最大級。建築設計は黒川紀章。
