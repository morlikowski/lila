== Biografi ==

Hillary Rodham dilahirkan di Park Ridge, Hugh Ellsworth Rodham, seorang konservatif, adalah seorang eksekutif dalam industri tekstil, dan ibunya, Hugh dan Tony. Mantan duta besar AS untuk Britania Raya, Philip Lader, merujuk kepada minatnya yang mendalam kepada nenek moyangnya dari Wales<ref>[http://www.wales.gov.uk/assemblydata/390999540003C90C00000BBC00000000.html#Anerchiad%20gan%20Ei%20Ardderchowgrwydd%20Mr%20Philip%20Lader,%20Llysgennad%20Unol%20Daleithiau%20AmericaAddress%20by%20His%20Excellency%20Mr%20Philip%20Lader,%20Ambassador%20of%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America Official Report of the Welsh Assembly 06/07/99]</ref>

Lulus dari Sekolah Hukum Yale pada tahun 1973, ia pindah ke Arkansas pada tahun 1974 dan kemudian menikahi Bill Clinton pada 1975. Ia lalu menjadi rekan wanita pertama di Firma Hukum Rose pada tahun 1979 dan dua kali tercatat sebagai salah seorang dari 100 pengacara paling berpengaruh di Amerika. Dari tahun 1979 hingga 1981 dan 1981 hingga 1992 ia adalah Ibu Gubernur Arkansas dan aktif dalam sejumlah organisasi yang terkait dengan kesejahteraan anak-anak serta menjadi anggota direksi Wal-Mart dan beberapa perusahaan lainnya.

Sebagai Ibu Negara Amerika Serikat, rancangan layanan kesehatan Clinton yang merupakan inisiatif terbesarnya gagal disetujui Kongres pada tahun 1994. Pada tahun 1997 dan 1999, Clinton berperan dalam pembentukan Program Asurasi Kesehatan Anak-Anak Negara (''State Children's Health Insurance Program''), Undang-Undang Adopsi dan Keluarga Aman (''Adoption and Safe Families Act''), dan Undang-Undang Kemandirian Asuhan Keluarga (''Foster Care Independence Act''). Pada tahun 1996, ia diperintahkan untuk memberikan kesaksian di hadapan juri akibat kontroversi Whitewater. Ia tidak pernah didakwa dengan tuduhan apapun maupun beberapa penyelidikan lainnya selama masa kepresidenan suaminya. Kondisi pernikahannya dengan Bill Clinton menjadi perhatian umum setelah terungkapnya skandal Lewinsky pada tahun 1998.

Setelah pindah ke New York, Clinton terpilih sebagai senator Negara Bagian New York pada tahun 2000 sehingga menjadi mantan Ibu Negara pertama yang memenangi pemilihan umum untuk suatu jabatan di AS. Di Senat, awalnya ia mendukung pemerintahan George W. Bush mengenai beberapa kebijakan luar negeri, termasuk memberikan suaranya dalam mendukung Resolusi Perang Irak yang menyetujui dilaksanakannya Perang Irak. Ia kemudian berbalik menentang tindakan pemerintah dalam Perang Irak dan juga menentang kebijakan pemerintah Bush dalam hampir seluruh masalah dalam negeri. Ia terpilih kembali sebagai senator dengan kemenangan telak pada tahun 2006. Pada 20 Januari 2007 ia resmi menyatakan dirinya ikut serta dalam pemilihan umum presiden Amerika Serikat 2008.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070120/ap_on_el_pr/democrats2008_1 Analysis: Clinton enters historic race]</ref> Pada pemilihan calon presiden Amerika tersebut, Clinton berhasil memenangi lebih banyak pemilihan pendahuluan dan anggota delegasi daripada wanita lainnya sepanjang sejarah AS, namun setelah kampanye yang panjang, Senator Barack Obama menjadi calon terpilih Partai Demokrat pada Juni 2008.

After moving to New York, Clinton was elected as senator for New York State in 2000. That election marked the first time an American First Lady had run for public office; Clinton is also the first female senator to represent New York. In the Senate, she initially supported the reelected by a wide margin in 2006.

Raised in a politically conservative household,<ref name="brock-4">Brock 1996, p. 4.  Her father was an outspoken Republican, while her mother kept quiet but was "basically a Democrat." See also Clinton 2003, p. 11.</ref> at age thirteen Rodham helped canvass South Side Chicago following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she found evidence of Republican candidate U.S. presidential election of 1964.<ref> p. 266.</ref>  Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and met civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. in Chicago in 1962.<ref>Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, pp. 18–21.  The teacher, Paul Carlson, and the minister, Donald Jones, came into conflict in Park Ridge; Clinton would later see that "as an early indication of the cultural, political and religious fault lines that developed across America in the [next] forty years"  (Clinton 2003, p. 23).</ref>

===College===
In 1965, Rodham enrolled at American Civil Rights Movement and the presidential nomination campaign of Democrat assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty.<ref name="nyt090507"></ref> In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969;<ref name="bg011293"/><ref name="wcaddr"/> she was instrumental in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.<ref name="bg011293"/>  A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first woman President of the United States.<ref name="bg011293"/> So she could better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference, and she attended the "Wellesley in Washington" summer program.<ref name="nyt090507"/> Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican Representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller’s late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.<ref name="nyt090507"/>  Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami. However, she was upset by how Richard Nixon's campaign portrayed Rockefeller and what by she perceived as the convention's "veiled" racist messages, and left the Republican Party for good.<ref name="nyt090507"/> 

Returning to Wellesley for her final year, Rodham wrote her senior thesis about the tactics of radical community organizer was suppressed at White House request and became the subject of some speculation).<ref name="msn030207"></ref>  In 1969, she graduated with a Life'' magazine,<ref> The article features Rodham and two student commencement speakers from other schools, with photos and excerpts from their speeches.</ref> due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthy conditions).<ref>Clinton 2003, pp. 42–43.  Clinton would later write, and repeat on the ''Late Show with David Letterman'', that sliming fish was the best preparation she would ever have for living in Washington.  See also Morris 1996, p. 139.</ref>

===Law school===
Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she served on the editorial board of the ''Yale Review of Law and Social Action''.<ref name="arkhc"></ref> During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,<ref name="gerth-42">Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, pp. 42–43.</ref> learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, ''Beyond the Best Interests of the Child'' (1973).<ref name="bernstein-75">Bernstein 2007, p. 75.</ref><ref>The authors of ''Beyond the Best Interests of the Child'' were Center director Al Solnit, Yale Law professor Joe Goldstein, and Anna Freud.</ref> She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale-New Haven Hospital,<ref name="bernstein-75"/> and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.<ref name="gerth-42"/> In the summer of 1970, she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor.  There she researched migrant workers' problems in housing, sanitation, health and education.<ref>Morris 1996, pp. 142–143.</ref> Edelman later became a significant mentor.<ref>Bernstein 2007, pp. 71–74.</ref> 

In the late spring of 1971, she began dating radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members);<ref name="bernstein-82"/> Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.<ref name="nys112607"> Gerstein finds it is unclear exactly which cases beyond child custody ones Rodham worked on at the Treuhaft firm. Anti-Clinton writers such as 1972 Democratic presidential candidate incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but that rather courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, on a case-by-case basis.<ref name="nyt082492"></ref>  The article became frequently cited in the field.<ref>[http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=rodham+%22children+under+the+law%22+43+%22Harvard+Educational+Review%22&btnG=Search This Google Scholar search result] produces nearly one hundred hits showing citations of her paper in academic literature.</ref>

==Marriage and family, law career and First Lady of Arkansas==
===From the East Coast to Arkansas===
During her post-graduate study, Rodham served as staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal.<ref>Clinton 2003, pp. 65–69.</ref> Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard Nussbaum,<ref name="bernstein-75"/> Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for impeachment.<ref name="bernstein-94">Bernstein 2007, pp. 94–96, 101–103.</ref>  The committee's work culminated in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.<ref name="bernstein-94"/>  

By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future; Democratic political organizer and consultant School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville,<ref>Clinton 2003, p. 70.</ref> where Bill Clinton also taught.  She still harbored doubts about marriage, concerned that her separate identity would be lost and that her accomplishments would be viewed in the light of someone else's.<ref>Bernstein 2007, pp. 62, 90, 117.</ref>

===Early Arkansas years===
Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975, and Hillary finally agreed to marriage.<ref>Bernstein 2007, p. 120.</ref>  Their wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room.<ref>Clinton 2003, p. 75.</ref>  She kept the name Hillary Rodham, later writing that she had done so to keep their professional lives separate and avoid seeming conflicts of interest, although her decision upset both their mothers.<ref>Clinton 2003, pp. 91–92.</ref>  Bill Clinton had lost the Congressional race in 1974, but in November 1976 was elected Arkansas Attorney General, and so the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.<ref>Clinton 2003, p. 78.</ref> There, in February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.<ref>Bernstein 2007, pp. 128, 130. The firm was actually called Rose, Nash, Williamson, Carroll, Clay & Giroir at the time; it simplified its name to Rose Law Firm in 1980.</ref> She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law,<ref name="arkhc"/> while also working ''pro bono'' in child advocacy;<ref name="bernstein-133"/> she rarely performed litigation work in court.<ref>Bernstein 2007, pp. 131–132.</ref>  

Rodham maintained her interest in children's law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles "Children's Policies: Abandonment and Neglect" in 1977<ref></ref> and "Children's Rights: A Legal Perspective" in 1979.<ref></ref>  The latter continued her argument that children's legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances, and that serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted.<ref name="nyt082492"/>  An legal "crit" theory run amok.<ref>Olson 1999, p. 57.</ref>

Also in 1977, Rodham co-founded the Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children's Defense Fund.<ref name="arkhc"/><ref>Bernstein 2007, p. 154.</ref>  And later that same year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had done 1976 campaign coordination work in Indiana<ref>Clinton 2003, pp. 77–78.</ref>) appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation,<ref></ref> and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981.<ref></ref>  From mid-1978 to mid-1980<ref>For the start date, see Brock 1996, p. 96. Secondary sources give inconsistent dates as to when her time as chair ended. Primary sources indicate that sometime between about April 1980 and September 1980, Rodham was replaced as chair by F. William McCalpin. See  Rodham is still chair after having given birth "a few weeks ago"; Chelsea Clinton was born on February 27, 1980.  And see  pp. 388–403, exact reference p. 398, which shows McCalpin as chair in September 1980.</ref> she served as the chair of that board, the first woman to do so.<ref>Morris 1996, p. 225.</ref>  During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90&nbsp;million to $300&nbsp;million; subsequently she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan's attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.<ref name="bernstein-133">Bernstein 2007, p. 133.</ref>

Following her husband's November 1978 election as Governor of Arkansas, Rodham became First Lady of Arkansas in January 1979, her title for a total of twelve years (1979–1981, 1983–1992). Clinton appointed her chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,<ref name="nyt012093mk"></ref> where she successfully secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest areas without affecting doctors' fees.<ref>Bernstein 2007, p. 147.</ref>

In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm.<ref>Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, p. 60.</ref> From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.<ref name="bernstein-130">Bernstein 2007, p. 130.</ref> During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham made a spectacular profit from trading cattle futures contracts;<ref name="gerth-66">Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, pp. 66–67.</ref> an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.<ref>Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, pp. 73–76.</ref> The couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Jim and Susan McDougal at this time.<ref name="gerth-66"/>

On Chelsea, her only child.  In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for reelection.

===Later Arkansas years===
Bill Clinton returned to the governor's office two years later by winning the election of 1982. During her husband's campaign, Rodham began to use the name Hillary Clinton, or sometimes "Mrs. Bill Clinton", to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters;<ref name="lastname">Bill Clinton's advisers thought her use of her maiden name to be one of the reasons for his 1980 gubernatorial reelection loss. During the following winter, Vernon Jordan, Jr. suggested to Hillary Rodham that she start using the name Clinton, and she began to do so publicly with her husband's February 1982 campaign announcement. She later wrote that "I learned the hard way that some voters in Arkansas were seriously offended by the fact that I kept my maiden name" (Clinton 2003, pp. 91–93; see also Morris 1996, p. 282).</ref> she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law in order to campaign for him full-time.<ref>Bernstein 2007, p. 166.</ref> As First Lady of Arkansas, Hillary Clinton was named chair of the Arkansas Educational Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state's court-sanctioned public education system.<ref name="bernstein-170">Bernstein 2007, pp. 170–175. Bernstein states that "the political battle for education reform ... would be her greatest accomplishment in public life until she was elected to the U.S. Senate."</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Hillary Clinton Guides Movement to Change Public Education in Arkansas | url = http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=528&issue_id=29&page=1

Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was First Lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours,<ref>Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, p. 63.</ref> but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.<ref name="nyt022694"></ref>  She seldom did trial work,<ref name="nyt022694"/> but the firm considered her a "rainmaker" because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent the firm and to her corporate board connections.<ref name="nyt022694"/>  She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.<ref name="nyt022694"/>  Bill Clinton's Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial reelection campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest, because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons deflected the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.<ref>Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, pp. 80–81.</ref>

Clinton served on the boards of the Wal-Mart Stores (1986–1992)<ref name="vv052400"></ref> and Lafarge (1990–1992).<ref></ref>  TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.<ref name="nyt022694"/><ref name="nyt052007"/>  Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart's board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to the board.<ref name="nyt052007"></ref> Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, was largely unsuccessful in a campaign for more women to be added to the company's management, and was silent about the company's famously anti-labor union practices.<ref name="nyt052007"/><ref name="abc013108"></ref><ref name="vv052400"/>

===1992 Bill Clinton presidential campaign===
thumb|upright|right|Hillary Rodham Clinton, 1992
Hillary Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination of 1992. Before the first person. See   Wynette added that Clinton had "offended every true country music fan and every person who has 'made it on their own' with no one to take them to a White House."  See   A few days later, on ''Prime Time Live'', Hillary Clinton apologized to Wynette. Clinton would later write that she had been careless in her choice of words and that "the fallout from my reference to Tammy Wynette was instant — as it deserved to be — and brutal."  See Clinton 2003, p. 108. The two women later resolved their differences, with Wynette appearing at a Clinton fund raiser.</ref> and about women staying home and baking cookies and having teas,<ref>Less than two months after the Tammy Wynette remarks, Hillary Clinton was facing questions about whether she could have avoided possible conflicts of interest between her governor husband and work given to the Rose Law Firm, when she remarked, "I've done the best I can to lead my life ... You know, I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life" (Clinton 2003, p. 109).  The "cookies and teas" part of this statement prompted even more culture-based criticism of Clinton's apparent distaste for women who had chosen to be homemakers; the remark became a recurring campaign liability (Bernstein 2007, pp. 205–206). Clinton subsequently offered up some cookie recipes as a way of making amends, and would later write of her chagrin: "Besides, I've done quite a lot of cookie baking in my life, and tea-pouring too!" (Clinton 2003, p. 109).</ref> that were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill Clinton said that electing him would get "two for the price of one" or "buy one, get one free", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.<ref>Brock 1996, p. 261.</ref><ref></ref>  Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 ''The American Spectator'' article "The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock", Hillary Clinton's own past ideological and ethical record came under conservative attack.<ref name="macbeth"></ref>

When Bill Clinton took office as president in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady of the United States, and announced that she would be using that form of her name.<ref>  Her announcement was parodied by the May 1993 film spoof ''post-graduate degree<ref name="nyp103006"> Clinton had the first post-graduate degree through regular study and scholarly work. Eleanor Roosevelt had been previously awarded a post-graduate honorary degree.

Some critics called it inappropriate for the First Lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors and that voters were well aware that she would play an active role in her husband's presidency.<ref></ref> Bill Clinton's campaign promise of "two for the price of one" led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as "co-presidents",<ref></ref> or sometimes the Arkansas label "Billary".<ref></ref><ref name="nyt012093mk"/>  The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a First Lady were enough to send Clinton into "imaginary discussions" with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt;<ref> The Eleanor Roosevelt "discussions" were first reported in 1996 by ''The Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures.<ref name="mj0907"></ref><ref>Bernstein 2007, pp. 313–314.</ref>  Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy, and ''Tikkun'' editor Michael Lerner's "politics of meaning" to overcome what she saw as America's "sleeping sickness of the soul" and that would lead to a willingness "to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium."<ref></ref><ref></ref>  Other segments of the public focused on her appearance, which had evolved over time from inattention to fashion during her days in Arkansas,<ref>Clinton 2003, pp. 110–111.</ref> to a popular site in the early days of the Vogue'' magazine in 1998.<ref></ref>

In 1993, Bill Clinton appointed Hillary Clinton to head and be the chairwoman of the Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.<ref>Bernstein 2007, pp. 170–175.</ref> The recommendation of the task force became known as the in the House election and seven in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats' defeat, especially among independent voters.<ref></ref>  Opponents of universal health care would continue to use "Hillarycare" as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.<ref></ref>

Other investigations took place during Hillary Clinton's time as First Lady.  Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an affair that became known as "Robert Ray issued his final Whitewater reports in 2000, no claims were made against Hillary Clinton regarding this.<ref></ref>  In March 1994 newspaper reports revealed  her spectacular profits from cattle futures trading in 1978–1979;<ref></ref> allegations were made in the press of conflict of interest and disguised bribery,<ref name="wsj102600"/> and several individuals analyzed her trading records, but no official investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing.<ref name="wsj102600"></ref>  An outgrowth of the Travelgate investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called "Filegate";<ref name="cnn072800"/> accusations were made that Hillary Clinton had requested these files and that she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.<ref></ref>  The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Hillary Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.<ref name="cnn072800"></ref>

===Lewinsky scandal===

In 1998, the Clintons' relationship became the subject of much speculation and gossip when it was revealed that the President had had extramarital sexual activities with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.<ref>Troy 2006, pp. 176–177.</ref> Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of Bill Clinton.  When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that they were the result of a "vast right-wing conspiracy",<ref>Troy 2006, p. 183.</ref> characterizing the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Clinton political enemies,<ref>Clinton was referring to the Arkansas Project and its funder Richard Mellon Scaife, Kenneth Starr's connections to Scaife, Regnery Publishing and its connections to Lucianne Goldberg and Linda Tripp, Jerry Falwell, and others.  See </ref> rather than any wrongdoing by her husband.  She later said that she had been misled by her husband's initial claims that no affair had taken place.<ref>Troy 2006, p. 187.</ref> After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible and he admitted to her his unfaithful behavior, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage,<ref>Bernstein 2007, p. 517.</ref> but privately was reported to be furious at him<ref>Bernstein 2007, pp. 512, 518.</ref> and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage.<ref>Bernstein 2007, p. 521.</ref>

There was a mix of public reactions to Hillary Clinton after this: some women admired her strength and poise in private matters made public, some sympathized with her as a victim of her husband's insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an enabler to her husband's indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.<ref>Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, p. 195.</ref> Overall, her public approval ratings in the wake of the revelations shot upward to around 70&nbsp;percent, the highest they had ever been.<ref name="gerth-195">Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, p. 195.</ref> In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to love: "No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met."<ref>Clinton 2003, p. 94. <!--double check page number--></ref>

===Traditional duties===
Clinton initiated and was Founding Chair of the Save America's Treasures program, a national effort that matched federal funds to private donations for the purpose of preserving and restoring historic items and sites,<ref></ref> including the flag that inspired "The Star-Spangled Banner" and the First Ladies Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.<ref name="nfll"/> She was head of the White House Millennium Council,<ref></ref> and hosted Millennium Evenings,<ref></ref> a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.<ref name="nfll"/> Clinton also created the first Sculpture Garden there, which displayed large contemporary American works of art loaned from museums in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden.<ref></ref>

In the White House, Clinton placed donated handicrafts of contemporary American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating display in the Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of Map Room to how it looked during bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.<ref name="nfll" />

==Senate election of 2000==

Clinton began her campaign by visiting every county in the state, in a "listening tour" of small-group settings.<ref>Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, p. 210.</ref>  During the campaign, she devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions.<ref name = "historic win"></ref> Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000&nbsp;jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included specific tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.<ref name = "historic win" />

The contest drew national attention.  Lazio blundered during a September debate by seeming to invade Clinton's personal space trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement.<ref name=gerth-213/> The campaigns of Clinton and Lazio, along with Giuliani's initial effort, spent a record combined $90&nbsp;million.<ref name="nyt121300"></ref> Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55&nbsp;percent of the vote to Lazio's 43&nbsp;percent.<ref name=gerth-213>Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, pp. 212–213.</ref> She was sworn in as United States Senator on January 3, 2001.

===First term===
Upon entering the United States Senate, Clinton maintained a low public profile and built relationships with senators from both parties.<ref></ref> She forged alliances with religiously inclined senators by becoming a regular participant in the The Fellowship.<ref></ref><ref>Clinton described Coe in her 2003 memoir as "a genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guide" and "a source of strength and friendship" during her First Lady years. Clinton's associates distanced her from Coe in 2008, saying that Clinton was not a member of The Fellowship and never contributed money it. They also said that Clinton had not heard sermons Coe gave using Nazi and Communist leaders as examples of gaining commitment. See </ref> 

Clinton has served on five Senate committees: Committee on Budget (2001–2002),<ref name="umich"></ref> Committee on Armed Services (since 2003),<ref name="hwar"></ref> Committee on Environment and Public Works (since 2001),<ref name="umich"/> Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (since 2001)<ref name="umich"/> and Special Committee on Aging.<ref name="hccom"></ref>
She is also a Commissioner of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe<ref></ref> (since 2001).<ref></ref>

Following the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders.<ref>Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, pp. 238–239.</ref>  Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she worked to address some of the civil liberties concerns with it,<ref></ref> before voting in favor of a compromise renewed act in March 2006 that gained large majority support.<ref></ref>

Clinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.<ref></ref> Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized United States President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq, should such action be required to enforce a United Nations Security Council Resolution after pursuing with diplomatic efforts. (However, Clinton voted against the Levin Amendment to the Resolution, which would have required the President to conduct vigorous diplomacy at the U.N., and would have also required a separate Congressional authorization to unilaterally invade Iraq.<ref name="hwar"/>  She did vote for the Byrd Amendment to the Resolution, which would have limited the Congressional authorization to one year increments, but the only mechanism necessary for the President to renew his mandate without any Congressional oversight was to claim that the Iraq War was vital to national security each year the authorization required renewal.)<ref name="hwar"/>

After the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to both Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier, and that parts of the country were functioning well.<ref></ref> Noting that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular United States Army by 80,000&nbsp;soldiers to ease the strain.<ref> (no longer free)</ref> In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush's pledge to stay "until the job is done" was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis "an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves." She criticized the administration for making poor decisions in the war, but said it was more important to solve the problems in Iraq.<ref></ref> Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic party who favored immediate withdrawal.<ref></ref> Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for veterans, and lobbied against the closure of several military bases.<ref></ref>

Senator Clinton voted against President Bush's two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.<ref name="pvs-hrc"/>  Clinton voted against both the 2005 confirmation of John G. Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States<ref></ref> and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court.<ref></ref>

In 2005, Clinton called for the hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game ''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas''.<ref></ref> Along with Senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games.  In July 2004 and June 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.<ref name="pvs-hrc"></ref><ref></ref> 

Looking to establish a "progressive infrastructure" to rival that of 2004 Senate elections, successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging.<ref name="gerth-267"/>

===Reelection campaign of 2006===
In November 2004, Clinton announced that she would seek a second Senate term. The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers, along with several third-party candidates. Throughout the campaign, Clinton consistently led Spencer in the polls by wide margins. She won the election on November 7, 2006 with 67&nbsp;percent of the vote to Spencer's 31&nbsp;percent,<ref></ref> carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties.<ref></ref> Clinton spent $36&nbsp;million for her reelection, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. She was criticized by some Democrats for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008.<ref> page A1.</ref> In the following months she transferred $10&nbsp;million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.<ref name="cnn040107"></ref>
