A '''financial audit''', or more accurately, an '''audit of financial statements''', is the examination by an independent third party of the financial statements of a company or any other legal entity (including governments), resulting in the publication of an independent opinion on whether or not those financial statements are relevant, accurate, complete, and fairly presented.

Financial audits are typically performed by firms of ''practising accountants'' due to the specialist financial reporting knowledge they require.  The financial audit is one of many ''assurance'' or ''attestation'' functions provided by accounting and auditing firms, whereby the firm provides an independent opinion on published information.

Many organisations separately employ or hire External auditors  may choose to place limited reliance on the work of internal auditors.

== Purpose ==

Financial audits exist to add credibility to the implied assertion by an organization's management that its financial statements fairly represent the organization's position and performance to the firm's ''stakeholders'' (interested parties).  The principal stakeholders of a company are typically its ''shareholders'', but other parties such as tax authorities, banks, regulators, suppliers, customers and employees may also have an interest in ensuring that the financial statements are accurate.

The audit is designed to reduce the possibility of a ''material misstatement''.  A ''misstatement'' is defined as false or missing information, whether caused by fraud (including deliberate misstatement) or error.  ''Material'' is very broadly defined as being large enough or important enough to cause stakeholders to alter their decisions.

The exact 'audit opinion' will vary between countries, firms and audited organisations.

In the US, the CPA firm provides written assurance that financial reports are 'fairly presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).'  The measure for 'fairly presented' is that there is less than 5% chance (5% audit risk) that the financial statements are 'materially misstated'.

== History ==
=== Audit of government expenditure ===

The earliest surviving mention of a public official charged with auditing government expenditure is a reference to the Auditor of the Exchequer in England in 1314.  The Auditors of the Imprest were established under Queen Elizabeth I in 1559 with formal responsibility for auditing Exchequer payments.  This system gradually lapsed and in 1780, Commissioners for Auditing the Public Accounts were appointed by statute.  From 1834, the Commissioners worked in tandem with the Comptroller of the Exchequer, who was charged with controlling the issue of funds to the government.

As Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Ewart Gladstone initiated major reforms of public finance and Parliamentary accountability. His 1866 Exchequer and Audit Departments Act required all departments, for the first time, to produce annual accounts, known as appropriation accounts. The Act also established the position of Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) and an Exchequer and Audit Department (E&AD) to provide supporting staff from within the civil service. The C&AG was given two main functions – to authorise the issue of public money to government from the Bank of England, having satisfied himself that this was within the limits Parliament had voted – and to audit the accounts of all Government departments and report to Parliament accordingly.

Auditing of UK government expenditure is now carried out by the National Audit Office.
Sing industry (acting through various organisations throughout the years) as to the accounting standards for financial reporting, and the U.S. Congress has deferred to the SEC.

This is also typically the case in other developed economies.  In the UK, auditing guidelines are set by the institutes (including ACCA, ICAEW, ICAS and ICAI) of which auditing firms and individual auditors are members.

Accordingly, financial auditing standards and methods have tended to change significantly only after auditing failures.  The most recent and familiar case is that of Enron. The company succeeded in hiding some important facts, such as off-book liabilities, from banks and shareholders.  Eventually, Enron filed for bankruptcy, and (as of 2006) is in the process of being dissolved.  One result of this scandal was that Arthur Andersen, then one of the five largest accountancy firms worldwide, lost their ability to audit public companies, essentially killing off the firm.

A recent trend in audits (spurred on by such accounting scandals as Enron and Worldcom) has been an increased focus on internal control procedures, which aim to ensure the completeness, accuracy and validity of items in the accounts, and restricted access to financial systems.  This emphasis on the internal control environment is now a mandatory part of the audit of SEC-listed companies, under the auditing standards of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

== Stages of an audit ==

A financial audit is performed before the release of the financial statements (typically on an annual basis), and will overlap the 'year-end' (the date which the financial statements relate to).

The following are the stages of a typical audit:

=== Planning and risk assessment ===

Timing: before year-end

Purpose:
* to understand the business of the company and the environment in which it operates.
* to determine the major audit risks (i.e. the chance that the auditor will issue the wrong opinion).  For example, if sales representatives stand to gain bonuses based on their sales, and they account for the sales they generate, they have both the incentive and the ability to overstate their sales figures, thus leading to overstated revenue.  In response, the auditor would typically plan to increase the rigour of their procedures for checking the sales figures.

=== Internal controls testing ===

En '''revisor''' er en person, der har som arbejde at revidere regnskaber, det vil sige at kontrollere deres rigtighed - om bilag forefindes, kontoplanen overholdes m.m.

==Autorisation==

Der er knyttet to autorisationsordninger til revisor-erhvervet:
* De statsautoriserede revisorer.
* De registrerede revisorer.
Alle aktie- og anpartsselskaber skal revideres af en autoriseret revisor - børsnoterede selskaber af en statsautoriseret revisor.

En meget stor del af den autoriserede revision udføres af de fire store (''big four'')verdensomspændende revisionsfirmaer Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young og KPMG, som alle er repræsenteret i Danmark.

Desuden findes en række personer, der er beskæftigede som revisorer, men som ikke har autorisation (titlen er ikke beskyttet). Endelig er der mange foreningsvalgte revisorer, som hyppigt er uden særlige forudsætninger for at gennemføre revision - men er valgt ud fra et godt omdømme og sund fornuft.

==Revision==

Revisionen skal sikre, at det aflagte regnskab giver et ''retvisende billede'' (Årsregnskabsloven, kapitel 3). For den offentlige økonomi - herunder foreninger og fonde, som bestyrer offentlige tilskud - er kravet i princippet det samme, idet der hyppigt også skal gennemføres ''forvaltningsrevision''; det skal kontrolleres, at anvendelse af resurser er i overensstemmelse med de givne regler, og at anvendelsen sker på en effektiv måde.

Revisionen kan ske ved en kombination af følgende tre metoder:
* Systemanalytisk revision (eller systemrevision) - hvor det kontrolleres, i hvilken grad den reviderede virksomheds egne forretningsgange og kontroller sikrer en korrekt dataopsamling. Systemanalytisk revision inddrager elementer fra systemanalysen.
* Regnskabsanalytisk revision - hvor det vurderes om regnskabets tal er plausible i forhold til den viden revisor har om virksomheden. Den regnskabsanalytiske revion inddrager elementer fra regnskabsanalysen.
* Substansrevision - hvor der gennemføres en stikprøvevis kontrol af bilag mv. Substansrevisionen giver både et selvstændigt bidrag til revisionens konklussion, men bidrager også til kontrollen af, at virksomhedens kontroller har været effektive (systemanalytisk revision).

Resultatet af revisionen er en ''påtegning'' af regnskabet, hvor:
# Det reviderede regnskab identificeres.
# Det påpeges, at det er ledelsens aflagte regnskab, som er revideret.
# Der redegøres (kort) for den udførte revision.
# Der redegøres for eventuelle forbehold (herunder eventuelt forbrug af midler, som ikke er i overensstemmelse med regler eller bevillinger under det offentlige område).
# Der gives eventuelle supplerende oplysninger.
# Der konkluderes, om regnskabet kan anses for retvisende.
Såfremt der ikke er forbehold eller supplerende oplysninger og regnskabet er retvisende, siges der at være tale om en ''blank påtegning''.
