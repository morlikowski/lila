thumb|Герб династии Багратиони 
'''Багратио́ны''' (груз. ბაგრატიონები)—  древний царский род Грузии, давший много выдающихся государственных деятелей и военных в Грузии и России.

== Происхождение рода ==

Грузинская летописная традиция возводит происхождение Багратионов к ветхозаветному царю Давиду, чем и объясняется наличие пращи и лиры в гербе рода. От Давида ведется линия потомков до Святого Иосифа, у которого предполагается сестра Клеопа. Ее сын Наом (62-е поколение от Адама) в традиции считается предком Багратионов.

<blockquote>
Наом родил Салу, Сала родил Ровоама, Ровоам родил Мухтара, Мухтар родил Елиакима, Елиаким родил Вениамена, Вениамен родил Иеровема, Иеровем родил Моиссея, Моиссей родил Иуду, Иуда родил Елиазара, Елиазар родил Лева, Лев родил Иорама, Иорам родил Манассея, Манассей родил Якова, Яков родил Микию, Микия родил Иоакима, Иоаким родил Иуровима, Иуровим родил Авраама, Авраам родил Иова, Иов родил Акаба, Акаб родил Свимона, Свимон родил Изахара, Изахар родил Аввию, Аввия родил Гаада, Гаад родил Асера, Асер родил Исаака, Исаак родил Дана, Дан родил Соломона, Соломон родил этих семерых братьев: Баграта, Абгавара, Мобала, Гурама, Саака, Асама и Варзаварда. Они ушли из Филистима и явились к царице Рахел. Сия царица Рахел крестила их и Баграта взяла к себе зятем и Абгавара и Мобала породнила с царем армян.<ref>Вахушти Багратиони, История царства Грузинского Тб. 1976</ref>
</blockquote>

Именно Баграт (в русской традиции - Панкрат) считается основателем рода, названного его именем.

<blockquote>
А потом преставился Баграт эристави в подчинении у сыновей Мирдата лета Христова 568, грузинского 320 и оставил сына именем Гурам. Однако в эти же годы вымерли сыновья Мирдата, сына царя Вахтанга, и не оставили они сыновей [и они] оставили наследником своих владений сына сестры деда своего Гурама и нарекли его Мирдатовани. И сей Гурам, сын Баграта, после них занял их владения от Ташискари—Панавари до моря и затем сменил имя Мирдатована на имя отца своего — Багратиона.
</blockquote>

Потомки Баграта были эриставами царей Грузии.

Андрея Боголюбского, а во втором — за осетинским князем Давидом, сыном князя Джадарона. 

Грузинские летописцы считают Георгия I. Если эти сказания справедливы, то князья Багратионы, Грузинские и Мухранские — потомки в прямом мужском колене Гуарама I Куропалата (Георгия III, и тогда следует считать происхождение этих родов от осетинских владетелей.

The '''Bagrationi dynasty'''  () was the ruling family of Georgia.  Their ascendency lasted from the early Hellenized form of their dynastic name.  

The origin of the Bagrationi dynasty is disputed, as well as the time when they first appeared on Georgian soil. Traditional Georgian history writing begins the Bagrationi chronology in the 6th century and relates the family to earlier dynasties. 

The history of the dynasty is inextricably bound with that of Georgia. They began their rule, in the early 9th century, as presiding princes in historic southwestern Georgia and the adjacent Georgian marchlands reconquered from Arabs. Subsequently they restored, in 888, the Georgian kingdom, which prospered from the 11th to the 13th century, bringing several regional polities under its control. This period of time, particularly the reigns of David IV (1089 - 1125) and his great granddaughter Tamar (1184 - 1213), is celebrated as a "Russian annexation in the early 19th century. The dynasty persisted as an Imperial Russian noble family until the 1917 Soviet rule in Georgia in 1921 forced many representatives of the family to relocate to Western Europe. One of the branches continues to this day to style themselves as the Royal House of Georgia.  
==Origins==
 
thumb|<small>An earlier version of the Bagrationi family blazon. ''The Atlas of Georgia'', by [[Vakhushti Bagrationi|Prince Vakhushti, c. 1740s.</small>]]   
According to a family legend, taken down by the eleventh-century Georgian chronicler biblical king and AD. Tradition has it that of seven refugee brothers of the Iberia by Classical authors) where they intermarried with the local ruling houses and acquired some lands in hereditary possession. One of the four brothers, Guaram (died in 532), allegedly gave an origin to a line subsequently called ''Bagrationi'' after his son Bagrat.<ref>The earliest Georgian forms of the dynastic name are ''Bagratoniani'', ''Bagratuniani'' and ''Bagratovani'', changed subsequently into Bagrationi. These names as well as the Armenian ''Bagratuni'' and the modern designation ''Bagratid'' mean "the children of Guaram, was installed as a presiding prince of Kartli under the Byzantine protectorate and bestowed, on this occasion, with the Byzantine court title of ''Kouropalates'' <ref>From the time of Russian translation available at [http://www.armenianhouse.org/bagrationi/history-ru/6.html ArmenianHouse.org]. URL accessed on May 22. 2006.</ref> Thus, according to this version, began the dynasty of the Bagratids, who ruled until 1801. <ref></ref>

This tradition had been given a general acceptance until the early 20th century. <ref>Suny (1994), 349</ref> While the Jewish origin, let alone the biblical descent of the Bagratids, has been largely discounted by modern scholarship, the issue of their origin still remains controversial. Several Soviet-era historians of Georgia developed a view summarized by N. Berdzenishvili and ''et al'' in their standard reference book on the history of Georgia:

  
thumb|<small>The Bagratid domains in [[Tao-Klarjeti, c. 780-1000</small>]]
Many modern scholars, however, argue the above version, referring to a more complex analysis of primary Armenian and Georgian sources. A genealogical scheme per Armenian Bagratid dynasty in the person of Adarnase, whose father Vasak (son of Ashot III the Blind, presiding prince of Armenia from 732 to 748) passed to Kartli following an abortive uprising against Arab rule in 772. Adarnase’s son, Ashot I, attained to the principate of Kartli in 813 and thus founded the last royal house of Georgia. Accordingly, the legend of Davidic origin of the Georgian Bagratids was a further development of the earlier claim entertained by the Armenian dynasty and their apologist Moses of Khorene.<ref>Toumanoff, C. ''Iberia on the Eve of Bagratid Rule'', p. 22, cited in: Suny (1994), p. 349</ref> Once the Georgian branch, who had quickly acculturated in the new environment,<ref>Rapp (2003), p. 169</ref> assumed royal power, the myth of their biblical origin helped to assert their legitimacy and emerged as a main ideological pillar of the millennium-long Bagrationi rule in Georgia.<ref>Rapp (2003), p. 234</ref>   

Although certain, generation by generation, history of the Bagrationi dynasty begins only in the late 8th century, C. Toumanoff has demonstrated that the first Georgian branch of the Bagratids may be traced back as far as the second century A.D., when we hear them ruling over the princedom of Odzrkhe in what is now southern Georgia.<ref>Toumanoff, C. ''Studies in Christian Caucasian History'', p. 316, cited in: Rapp (2003), p. 145</ref> The Odzrkhe line, known in the medieval annals as the Bivritianis, lasted until the 5th century AD and they cannot be considered as the direct ancestors of the later Bagratids who eventually restored Georgian royal authority.<ref>Rapp (2003), pp. 218, 249</ref>

== History ==
=== Early Bagrationi dynasty ===
thumb|120px|<small>[[David IV of Georgia</small>]]
The Bagrationi family grew in prominence by the time when Georgian monarchy (Sassanid Persian Empire in the sixth century, and the leading local princely families were exhausted by the Guaramids and the near-extinction of the Chosroids,<ref>Suny (1994), p. 29</ref> the two earlier Georgian dynasties, with whom the Bagratids extensively intermarried, and also by the Abbasid preoccupation with their own civil wars and the conflict with the Ashot I, the hereditary title of presiding prince (''emperor attached the title of ''kourapalates''.

Despite the revitalization of the monarchy, Georgian lands remained divided among rival authorities, with Tbilisi remaining in the Arab hands. The sons and grandsons of Ashot I established three separate branches – the lines of Kartli, Tao, and Klarjeti – frequently struggling with each other and with the neighboring rulers. The Kartli line prevailed; in 888, with Adarnase I, it restored the indigenous Georgian royal authority dormant from 580. His descendant Bagrat III  was able to gather his inheritance in both Tao-Klarjeti and Abkhazian Kingdom, due largely to the diplomacy and conquests of his energetic foster-father David III of Tao. 
thumb|120px|<small>Queen [[Tamar of Georgia and her father George III</small>]]
This unified monarchy maintained its precarious independence from the Byzantine and Seljuk empires throughout the 11th century, and flourished under David IV the Builder (1089 – 1125), who repelled the Seljuk attacks and essentially completed the unification of Georgia with the reconquest of Tbilisi in 1122. With the decline of the Byzantine power and the dissolution of the Great Seljuk Empire, Georgia became one of the most preeminent nations of the Christian East, her pan-Caucasian empire<ref></ref> stretching, at its largest extent, from northern Iran, and eastwards into Demetrios I (1125 - 1156), George III (1156 - 1184), and especially, his daughter Tamar (1184 - 1213). With the death of George III the main male line went extinct and the dynasty was continued by the marriage of Queen Tamar with the Alan prince David Soslan of the alleged Bagratid descent.<ref>According to Prince Vakhushti, David Soslan’s ancestry traced back to the Georgian refugeee prince David, a grandchild of George I of Georgia (1014 - 1027) and his Alan wife Alde.</ref>

=== Downfall ===
thumb|left|<small>Georgia at the peak of her might, c. 1184-1230</small>  
The invasions by the Khwarezmians in 1225 and the Mongols in 1236 terminated Georgia’s "golden age". The struggle against the Mongol rule created the state of Imereti, western Georgia. There was a brief period of reunion and revival under George V the Brilliant (1299 – 1302, 1314 – 1346), but the eight onslaughts of the Abkhazia, Ottoman and Persian domination, sometimes acting nothing but mere puppets in the hands of their powerful suzerains.

The line of Imereti, incessantly embroiled in civil wars, continued with many breaks in succession, and the kingdom was only relatively spared from the encroachments from its Ottoman overlords, while Kartli and Kakheti were subjected to numerous invasions by the Persians, whose efforts to annihilate the refractory vassal kingdoms went in vain, and the two eastern Georgian monarchies, though occasionally losing their independence in the course of their history, survived to be reunified, in 1762, under King Heraclius II, who united in his person both the Kakhetian and Kartlian lines, the latter represented by its junior branch of Mukhrani since 1658.

After the death of Heraclius in 1798, his son and successor George XII renewed a request of protection from the David, was never confirmed by the Russian government as a king, however, and on Alexander I formally reaffirmed Paul’s determination, removing the dynasty from the Georgian throne.<ref name="Britannica"/> The Bagrationi princes resisted though divided. Most of them were subsequently arrested and deported from Georgia.<ref>Lang (1957), p. 252</ref> 

The reign of the house of Imereti came to an end less than a decade later. On Solomon II, nominally an Ottoman vassal, was persuaded to conclude the Convention of Elaznauri with Russia, similar to the terms of the Treaty of Georgievsk. Yet the Russian forces dethroned Solomon on February 20 1810. Defeated in a subsequent rebellion to regain the power, he died in exile in Trabzon, Ottoman Turkey, in 1815.<ref>Suny (1994), p. 64; Baddeley, Gammer (1908), pp. 66, 78; [http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Georgia/imerati9.htm ''Royal Ark'' - Imerati, The Bagrationi dynasty]</ref>
