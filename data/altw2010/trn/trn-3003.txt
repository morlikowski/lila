'''Jackson Rod Stewart''' è un personaggio della serie ''Hannah Montana'', intepretato da Jason Earles con la voce italiana di Gabriele Patriarca. È il fratello di 16 anni di Miley Stewart e figlio di Robbie Ray Stewart.

== Informazioni del personaggio ==
Jackson è il tipico personaggio comico della serie. Jackson è un allievo mediocre che è molto più interessato alle ragazze. Il suo migliore amico è Cooper, (interpretato da Andre Jamal Kinney). In un episodio, ha tentato di uscire segretamente con la sorella di Cooper, Olivia, ma la ragazza saltava addosso al primo che incontrava, perciò lasciò stare.

Jackson ama la sua famiglia e come suo padre, tratta la sorella come Miley piuttosto che come Hannah Montana e mantiene il suo segreto. Ogni volta che Miley ha fatto qualcosa di male, inizia a formulare una giustificazione che lo tenga fuori dalla discussione (per esempio, "Sono sconvolto quanto te" oppure "Ho provato a fermarla") anche se solitamente è implicato fortemente ed il loro padre li scopre spesso e comunque. 

Jackson ha un automobile che è considerata dal padre e dagli amici un'automobile per donne. Il padre ha cambiato il clacson da uno squittio aguzzo ad un clacson da treno ed ha reso all'automobile un lowrider. 
Una volta Jackson è stato trovato a portare i vestiti della sorella, mentre è stato pagato per modellarlo dal progettista del costume del Hannah e normalmente indossa i vestiti dai fornitori americani.

'''Jackson Rod Stewart''' is a Hannah Montana'', portrayed by Robby and Susan Stewart. 

==Character information==
Laid back and casual, Jackson is typically the comic relief of the series, using one-liners or calling back names. Jackson is a mediocre high school student who is far more interested in food, girls, and his image. He would much rather be silly than serious, and his best friend is Cooper (in the first season) or Thor (in the second season and after). At one point, he attempted to secretly date Cooper's sister, but broke up with her because she flirted with every guy she met.

Like his dad, Jackson always treats his sister as Miley, rather than Hannah, and always keeps her secret. To help keep Miley's secret, Jackson once posed as her boyfriend, and began using his new-found fame as a magic ticket to popularity, even though he did not have a disguise. Whenever Miley has done something wrong, he starts forming an excuse (i.e., "I tried to stop her") that does not involve him, although he is usually strongly implicated, and their dad often finds out anyway. "He is a little kiss-up," as stated by his dad in one episode. 

Jackson has a car that is stereotypically considered a "girl's car", but he did not know it until Cooper pointed it out. His father changed the horn from a high-pitched squeak to a truck horn, and made the car a lowrider, with hydraulics and loud sound system. He also painted it blue. He mentions in ''Debt It Be'' that he paid off some of the money by selling tissues used by Miley during her sinus infection on the Internet (he sold them as "Used by Hannah Montana" for $37.95). He was once found wearing his younger sister's clothes, as he was paid to model them by Hannah's costume designer, but he normally wears clothing from American Eagle Outfitters and Hollister Co..

Jackson works at ''Rico's Surf Shop'' (named after the owners son Rico) on the beach. It is named after the owner, and Jackson is often forced to be nice whenever his bratty, manipulative son, Rico (Jackson's boss), drops by.  

Jackson plays Hannah Montana' episode "Grandmas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Play Favorites"</REF>He enjoys videogames, yet his portable system appears to be an "original" Nintendo GameBoy from the 80's.<ref>"Bye Bye Ball"</ref>

Jackson has a problem with sugary foods, (It is unclear when this started, although Jackson hints it began when he was 7 at Hannah Montana' episode "O Say Can You Remember the Words?"</REF>

During one of Miley's nightmares, he became a rock-star sensation named ''Bucky Kentucky''.<REF>''Hannah Montana' episode ''I Am Hannah, Hear Me Croak''</REF>

Jackson and Miley constantly bicker and compete for their father's approval. In the episode ''We Are Family: Now Get Me Some Water!'', Miley is tired of hearing Jackson complain about wanting a raise, and she goes to make Rico ask his father to give Jackson a raise, but instead gets her brother fired. Also, in ''You Gotta Not Fight for Your Right to Party'' Jackson and Miley must share a bathroom, and they start to fight. They end up trusting each other when they get into a dangerous situation (which actually turns out to be pretty minor).

Jackson's new friend, Thor, embarrasses him. He showed up in the second season, after having moved from Mooville, Minnesota. Jackson remembers a time when he was the new kid, and he then becomes Thor's only friend, despite how embarrassing he thinks Thor is. In the episode ''You Gotta Not Fight for Your Right to Party'', Jackson and Miley (Hannah at the time) borrow Thor's truck, in order to get to their parties. They soon drive off a dark road after almost hitting a deer, and are almost driven off a cliff (Which was later revealed to be only 2 feet).

Jackson can be very clever at times, like getting himself out of sticky situations. Also, Jackson creates schemes that could benefit himself and sometimes his sister, which most of the time fail. In the episode ''You Are So Sue-able to Me'', he pretends to have had three burritos, and sits on planted whoopie cushions. This frightens his dad out of going to the Los Angeles Lakers game, so he doesn't hurt his or Thor's feelings. In the end Robby finds out Jackson invited Thor first.

Jackson is good at impersonations, using them on 3 occasions to get out of trouble. He has done Elvis, Ozzy Osbourne, and the Godfather.

He is also known to take on many challenges, such as jumping a new record of 16 feet from the piano to the couch in the episode ''Hannah Montana' episode ''Joannie B. Goode''</REF> In the episode " O' Say Can You Remember The Words?" Jackson gains a sugar addiction.

In addition to Jackson destroying Miley's bear many times, it is hinted at that Jackson is 33 (which he really is). Pausing the shot in many episodes reveals that the short had of a clock is turned to a 3 and the long hand is at 3 minutes thus "33" In addition in one episode Jackson is seen with a small fat glass with ice and and unidentifiable clear liquid in it. In the back there is a Smirnoff vodka bottle seen in the back barely visible. Speaking to Michael Poryes the "Hannah Montana Fan Group" asked if this was appropriate for a Disney show. Michael responded "It was a hard day and (Jackson) had to do about 30 takes of him yelling at Miley (for that scene). He had some alcohol on set and had some in between takes. Honestly I don't know how it got there". Disney responded by digitally editing the Smirnoff bottle out of the shot. However rumors still persist of alcohol abuse on set. In a letter obtained by 20/20 Disney threatned Jackson with "cutting him out of the show" and even "killing his character would be perfectly acceptable". Jackson responded to this letter by stating "I found it unacceptable and in bad taste. Our buisness arrangments should not be made public, and future story lines should not be alluded too". Fans were outraged by Jackson's purported leaving but so far nothing has happened yet. "Surely this bizzare story has not ended". Host John Stossel was quoted as saying on the infamous 20/20 episode.
