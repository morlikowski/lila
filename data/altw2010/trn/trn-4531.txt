In the ''aberrations'' with psionic powers. They live in the moist caverns and cities of the enormous multiverse and use other intelligent creatures as thralls, slaves, and chattel. They have been highly influenced by H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.

==Licensing==
The illithid is considered a "Product Identity" by Wizards of the Coast and as such is not released under its Open Gaming License.<ref></ref>

==Typical physical characteristics==
Illithids have a basic humanoid body, but their head is octopus-like. They have four tentacles around a lamprey-like mouth, and require the brains of sentient creatures as part of their diet. An illithid who snares a living creature in all four of its tentacles can extract and devour its living brain.  Their eyes are pale white, and though their vision is limited to roughly 60 feet, they can see perfectly well in both darkness and light.  Their sense of hearing is slightly poorer than a human's; they have difficulty distinguishing between several sounds mixed together.  Their skin is mauve and covered in mucus, and is very sensitive to sunlight; illithids who make extended forays to the surface must wear protective clothing to maintain their skin moisture.

One of the most feared powers is the dreaded ''Mind Blast'', where the illithid emits a cone-shaped psionic shockwave with its mind in order to incapacitate any creature for a short amount of time. Illithids also have other psionic powers, generally telepathic in nature, although their exact effects have varied over editions. Other powers include a defensive psionic shield and powers of psionic domination for controlling the minds of others.
 
===Illithid biology===
Illithids are sapient creature. Hosts are determined in a very specific manner. Hosts generally are Drow, Elves, Grimlock, Gnoll, Goblinoid, and Orc.  Upon being implanted, the larva then grows and consumes the host's brain, absorbing the host's physical form entirely and becoming sapient itself, a mature (but still young) Illithid. This process is called '''ceremorphosis'''. Illithids often experiment with non-humanoid hosts, but ceremorphosis involving other creatures usually fails, killing both host and larva.

When an illithid undergoes ceremorphosis, it can occasionally take on some elements of the absorbed host creature's former mind, such as nail-biting or tapping one's foot. An adult illithid has even been known to hum a tune that its host knew in life. Usually, when a mind flayer inherits a trait like this, it keeps it a closely guarded secret, because, were its peers to learn of it, the illithid in question would surely be killed. This is due to an illithid assimilation of the host's personality and memories is technically impossible, there may at some time be a game supplement elaborating this point. 

Occasionally, ceremorphosis can partially fail. Sometimes the larva does not contain enough chemicals to complete the mutation, sometimes there is psionic interference. Whatever the reason, it has happened that ceremorphosis has ended after the internal restructuring, resulting in a human body with an illithid's personality and digestive tract. These unfortunates must still consume brains, typically by cutting open heads (as they lack the requisite tentacles). These beings are sent as spies to the surface, where they easily blend in with humans.

The illithid society also maintains a long-standing taboo. Every so often, a mind flayer community is attacked (often by vengeful githyanki and githzerai) and its inhabitants must flee. This leaves the larvae unattended. Bereft of exterior nourishment, they begin to consume one another. The survivor will eventually leave the pool in search of food (i.e., brains). This unmorphed larvae is known as a '''Neothelid'''. If the neothelid consumes an intelligent creature it will awaken to sapience and psionic abilities, while retaining its memories of savage survival. In ''Complete Psionic'', it was revealed that illithids have a step between larva and neothelid called a '''Larval Flayer''', which looks like an overgrown tadpole. The existence of these beasts is a guarded secret among illithids, and it is considered impolite to speak of them.

==The Adversary==
In the 2nd Edition AD&D adventure ''Dawn of the Overmind'', author Bruce Cordell revealed the nature of the Adversary. This being was an illithid created from the host body of a man named Strom Wakeman, a character referenced in some of Cordell's other 2nd Edition works, most notably as the "author" of ''The Illithiad'' supplement.

Wakeman, an enterprising trader and scholar of Underdark exotica, allowed himself to be captured by the illithids on one of his expeditions. Through the use of a non-magical mixture of various herbs that Wakeman named '''laethen''', he was able to preserve his consciousness through ceremorphosis, and learned to use his psionic powers to keep from having to consume brains. Thus he worked against the illithid plots from within. The legend of the Adversary was born from his frequent sabotage, though the actual acts were never connected to him. The players' characters in the adventure become his agents in stopping the illithids' plans, as his own movements rely upon secrecy from his "fellow" illithids.

For another person to imitate Wakeman's deed would require at least one dose of laethen (the making of which Wakeman kept secret) and to be put under ceremorphosis within a week of consumption. The drug only has a 40% chance of success, and the new illithid must also never consume a brain, for the act destroys the host's personality and replaces it with the illithid personality.

==Illithid variants==
===Ulitharid===
Ulitharids are created from tadpoles much like standard illithids; fewer than 1% become ulitharids, and it is impossible to determine whether a tadpole will become an ulitharid until ceremorphosis is complete.  

Superior in nearly all ways to a regular mind flayer, ulitharids possess two extra tentacles, which are  twice as long as the others, and an extreme arrogance, even by the standards of their own kind.  Only the elder brain holds more sway within an illithid community.

===Vampiric illithids===
The origins of these unique undead mind flayers are unclear.  All that is known of these creatures is that they cannot create spawn, need both fresh blood and fresh brains to survive, are more feral than typical illithids, and are barely intelligent.

===Yaggol===
The yaggol are a variant presented in the ''Dragonlance'' campaign setting.
 
The Yaggol are a race from the Emerald Sea of Neron, a dark, steamy jungle in southern Taladas. The history of their civilization stretches back to the end of the first age of Krynn. Their empire was thriving at the same time the High Ogres of Ansalon founded their own empire. Enslaving the Cha'asii elves, the yaggol ruled over the continent with a nightmarish will but this all came to end when the cha'asii learned how to defeat the mind powers of the yaggol. A great war was fought, and the empire crumbled as both sides nearly wiped each other out. All that remained of this once aberrant race was seven obsidian temples in the valley of Akh-Tazi.

After the shattering of the empire, an uneasy truce was struck, only broken by skirmishes and murder. The cha'asii went their separate ways; establishing villages like Ke-Cha-Yat where they could live in peace from the yaggol. This would all change with the coming of Gloomwing, a former orthlox Black Dragon that joined with the Brethren, the cult followers of Maladar an-Desh, Lord of Wizards.

===Alhoon===
Alhoons (also called illithiliches) are illithids that have grown powerful enough in magic to become liches.  Alhoons are generally pariahs in illithid society because they go against most illithids' eventual goal; to merge with the Elder Brain, both physically and psionically.  Alhoons, on the other hand, are more concerned with their own personal survival.

===Related creatures===
'''Brain Golem:'''  An eight-foot-tall humanoid-shaped construct made entirely of brain tissue, these creations exist only to serve an elder brain and its illithid community.

'''Brainstealer Dragon:'''  A mix of illithid and dragon, these powerful wyrms occasionally rule over illithid communities that lack an elder brain.

'''Illithidae:'''  Illithidae are to mind flayers as less intelligent animals are to humans.  Known types include the cessirid, embrac, kigrid, and saltor. Dragon magazine once published a template for use in creating an illithidae creature, for use with the 1st Edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. 

'''Illithocyte:''' Illithid tadpoles that survived the fall of a mind flayer empire, they evolved into a new life form and crawl about in groups seeking psychic radiation on which to feed.

These three-tentacled ceremorphs are despised by all, but their aptitude for stealth and psionic powers of stealth and shape control make them useful spies for the illithids.

'''Neothelid:''' If an illithid tadpole survives but fails to undergo ceremorphosis, it will eventually grow into an incredibly powerful worm-like creature with illithid tentacles at the forefront of its body and immense mental powers.

'''Nerve Swimmers''':  Derived from immature illithid tadpoles, these entities are living instruments of torture and interrogation.

'''Иллитиды''' (''Illithid''), они же проницатели (''mind flayers'') — вымышленные существа сеттинга Забытые Королевства. Раса была создана для ролевой игры Dungeons & Dragons в качестве «монстров» и в отличие от многих рас D&D является уникальной, ее копирование запрещено.

Иллитиды — существа, похожие на моллюсков с телами людей, обладающие способностями к гипнозу. Они обитают в тоннелях Подземья (Underdark). Они имеют некоторое сходство с божеством Говарда Лавкрафта.

== Биология ==
Внешне иллитиды выглядят как худощавые, гибкие щупалец.

Проницателями разума иллитидов прозвали за их природные способности к телепатически.

== Размножение ==
Проницатели — гермафродиты, размножающиеся личинками. Эти личинки, выглядящие как головы-кальмары с четырьмя щупальцами, обитают в бассейне Верховного Мозга. Выжившим в борьбе с прочими головастикам предоставляется тело: как правило, человека или эльфа. Личинка, надевшись на голову жертвы, сращивается с ее телом и поглощает мозг, вызывая постепенную мутацию в полноценного иллитида. Этот процесс, известный как цереброморфизм, в случае неудачи как правило убивает и паразита, и жертву.

Упоминались случаи неполного превращения в результате цереброморфизма: иллитиды, сохранившие разум человека или наоборот, люди, получившие разум иллитида при прежней внешности. Из-за этого иллитиды с подозренем относятся к своим сородичам, проявляющих хоть какое-либо сходство с человеческим поведением. Если такого мутанта удается выявить, его уничтожают немедленно.

Среди проницателей существует легенда о неком Противнике, внедрившемся в их ряды и организующем саботаж их планов. В одном из модулей Dungeons & Dragons упоминается, что этим Противником был человеческий маг по имени Стром Вэйкман, который позволил превратить себя в иллитида, предварительно приняв противоядие по собственному рецепту. В результате, став иллитидом он сохранил прежний разум и стал шпионом среди них, расстраивая их планы.

== Общество ==
Иллитиды обитают в пещерных городах глубоко в Подземье под Фэйруном. Их общество управляется Центральным Мозгом — огромным мозгом-маткой иллитидов, находящимся в центре каждого их города. Если иллитид умирает, его мозг отдают Центральному Мозгу, чтобы тот поглотил его и сохранил внутри себя всю память покойного. В случае гибели Главного Мозга его проницатели теряют значительную часть своих способностей. Иллитиды поклоняются Мозгам почти как богам.

В городах иллитидов много рабов из подземных рас или тех представителей наземных, кого им удалось поймать в тоннелях Подземья и подавить их волю. Рабы находятся под постоянным гипнозом проницателей. Они строят тоннели и залы, выращивают ''рофов'' (подземный скот), ухаживают за Центральным Мозгом и дерутся на гладиаторских боях, увеселяя свои хозяев. При этом, рабы получают удовольствие от исполнения желаний иллитидов и чувствуют печаль и даже боль при неудачах.
