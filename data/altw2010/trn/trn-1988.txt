La '''syrah''' (ou '''shiraz''') est un cépage rouge caractéristique de la partie septentrionale des Côtes du Rhône.

C'est le seul cépage autorisé pour les vins rouges de l'appellation Cornas. Il peut être associé à la Marsanne et à la Crozes-Hermitage, Hermitage et Saint-Joseph, et au viognier dans les vins rouges de l'appellation Côte Rôtie (selon le décret du 21 décembre 1966, « la proportion de Syrah doit constituer au moins 80 % du poids des raisins mis à la cuve pour produire le vin ayant droit à l'appellation contrôlée Côte Rôtie »).
Il est aussi utilisé comme cépage améliorateur dans les côtes du Rhône méridionales, en Languedoc et en Provence.

On lui supposait une origine orientale, en provenance de la ville iranienne de Chiraz. Cependant des recherches génétiques récentes ont permis d'identifier avec certitude que la syrah provient de la partie septentrionale des Côtes du Rhône et que c'est un croisement naturel de Dureza x Mondeuse Blanche.

En dehors de sa région de prédilection, ce cépage a été longtemps négligé, du fait de son faible rendement et de son manque de résistance à certaines maladies. Aujourd'hui ce n'est plus le cas, et la syrah s'est étendue à l'ensemble de la vallée du Rhône, puis à la Provence, au Languedoc-Roussillon et au Sud-Ouest, remplaçant notamment le carignan à la réputation injustement dégradée. Près de 350 km² sont plantés actuellement en France (dont plus de la moitié en Languedoc-Roussillon), et on cultive aussi la syrah en Australie, en Afrique du Sud, au Mexique, en Californie, en Suisse et dans divers autres pays dont la Corse.

La syrah donne un vin de garde, très coloré, aux arômes de petits fruits rouges, avec un parfum caractéristique de violette.

'''Syrah''' is a dark-skinned variety of Hermitage up to the late 1980s, but since that name is also a French Protected designation of origin, this naming practice caused problem on some export markets and was dropped. The name Shiraz for this grape variety is also commonly used in South Africa, Canada, and New Zealand. DNA profiling in 1999 found Syrah to be the offspring of two obscure grape varieties from southeastern France, Dureza and Mondeuse Blanche.

As of 2004, Syrah was estimated to be the world's 7th most grown variety at , after having enjoyed a strong growth in plantings for several years.<ref name="OCW Vine varieties">Entry on ''"Vine varieties"'' in J. Robinson (ed) ''The Oxford Companion to Wine'' Third Edition,  p. 746, Oxford University Press 2006, ISBN 0-19-860990-6</ref>

The grape is also known under many other synonyms that are used in various parts of the world including ''Antourenein Noir, Balsamina, Candive, Entournerein, Hignin Noir, Marsanne Noir, Schiras, Sirac, Syra, Syrac, Serine,'' and ''Sereine.''<ref name="Jancis">Jancis Robinson ''Vines, Grapes & Wine'' pg 90 Octopus Publishing 1986 ISBN 978-1-85732-999-5 </ref>

Syrah should not be confused with hybrid of Syrah with Peloursin dating from 1880.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
right|thumb|Syrah leaf.
Syrah has a long documented history in the Rhône region of Southeastern France, but before 1998 it was not known with certainty if it had originated in that region or was brought there. In that year, a study conducted by Department of Viticulture and Enology at the viticultural research station in Montpellier, France to conclude that Syrah was the offspring of the grape varieties Dureza (father) and Mondeuse Blanche (mother).<ref>[http://www.actahort.org/books/528/528_15.htm Bowers, J.E., Siret, R., Meredith, C.P., This, P. and Boursiquot, J.-.M. 2000.

Robinson (ed), ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'', Third Edition, p. 676-677, Oxford University Press 2006, ISBN 0-19-860990-6</ref> Dureza is a dark-skinned grape variety from the Ardèche region in France that have all but disappeared from the vineyards, and the preservation of such varieties is a speciality of Montpellier. Mondeuse Blanche is a white grape variety cultivated in the Savoy region, and still found in very small amounts in that region's vineyards today. Both varieties are somewhat obscure today, have never achieved anything near Syrah's fame or popularity, and there is no record of them ever having been cultivated any long distance from their present home. Thus, both Syrah's parents come from a limited area in southeastern France, very close to northern Rhône, where Syrah came to fame. Based on these findings, the researchers have concluded that Syrah originated in the same place where it came to fame - northern Rhône.<ref name="Syrah WW Origins"/><ref name="OCW Syrah"/>

The DNA typing leaves no room for doubt in this matter, and the numerous other hypotheses of the grape's origin which have been forwarded during the years all completely lack support in form of documentary evidence or ampelographic investigations, be it by methods of classical botany or DNA. Instead, they seem to have been based primarily or solely on the name or synonyms of the variety. Because of varying orthography for grape names, especially for old varieties, this is in general very thin evidence. Despite this, origins such as Syracuse or the Iranian city of Shiraz have been proposed.<ref name="OCW Syrah"/>

The parentage information does however not reveal how old the grape variety is, i.e., when the pollination of a Mondeuse Blanche vine by Dureza took place, leading to the original Syrah seed plant. In the year AD 77, Naturalis Historia'' about the wines of Vienne (which today would be called Côte-Rôtie), where the Allobroges made famous and prized wine from a dark-skinned grape variety that had not existed some 50 years earlier, in Virgil's age.<ref name="OCW Rhône">Entry on ''"Rhône"'' in J. Robinson (ed), ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'', Third Edition, p. 572-573, Oxford University Press 2006, ISBN 0-19-860990-6</ref> Pliny called the vines of this wine ''Allobrogica'', and it has been speculated that it could be today's Syrah. However, the description of the wine would also fit, for example, Dureza<ref name="Syrah WW Origins"/> and Pliny's observation that the vines of Allobrogica was resistant to cold is not entirely consistent with Syrah.<ref name="OCW Rhône"/>

=== The name Shiraz and associated legends ===

It seems that many of the legends of Syrah's origins come from one of its many synonyms - Shiraz.<ref name="OCW Shiraz">Entry on ''"Shiraz"'' in J. Robinson (ed), ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'', Third Edition, p. 627, Oxford University Press 2006, ISBN 0-19-860990-6</ref> Since there also is a city in Persia/Iran called Shiraz, where the famous Shirazi wine was produced<ref name="OCW Persia">Entry on ''"Persia"'' in J. Robinson (ed), ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'', Third Edition, p. 512-513, Oxford University Press 2006, ISBN 0-19-860990-6</ref>, some legends have claimed that the Syrah grape originated in Shiraz, and was brought to Rhône, which would make Syrah a local French synonym and Shiraz the proper name of the variety.

There are at least two significantly different versions of the myth, giving different accounts of how the variety is supposed to have been brought from Shiraz to Rhône and differing up to 1,800 years in dating this event. In one version, the Phocaeans should have brought Syrah/Shiraz to their colony around Marseilles (then known as Massilia), which was founded around 600 BC. The grape should then later have made its way to northern Rhône, which was never colonized by the Phocaeans. No documentary evidence exists to back up this legend, and it also requires that the variety later has vanished from the Marseilles region without leaving any trace.<ref name="OCW Rhône"/>

In another version, the person who brought the variety to Rhône is even named, being the crusader Gaspard de Stérimberg, who is supposed to have built the chapel at Hermitage.<ref name="OCW Rhône"/> Even before the advent of DNA typing of grapes, there were several problems with this legend. First, no ampelographic investigations of the grapes from Shiraz seem to have been made. Second, it is documented that Shirazi wine was white, ruling out the use of dark-skinned grapes such as Syrah, and no known descriptions of this wine's taste and character indicate any similarity whatsoever with red wines from the Rhône. Third, it is highly doubtful if any crusader would have journeyed as far east as Persia, since the crusades were focused on the Holy Land.

The legend connecting Syrah with Shiraz in Iran may however be of French origin, since it is supposed to have been included in a 1826 book called ''Œnologie Française'', although that book used the name Scyras for the grape variety.<ref name="Bob Ross">[http://www.wineloverspage.com/forum/village/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=11401&p=93659 Winelovers Discussion Group: Timeline of the name "Shiraz" in Australia]</ref>

Since the name Shiraz has been used primarily in Australia in modern time, while the earliest Australian documents use the spelling "Scyras", it has been speculated (among others by strinization" of Syrah's name via Scyras. However, while the names Shiraz and Hermitage gradually seem to have replaced Scyras in Australia from the mid-19th century, the spelling Shiraz has also been documented in British sources back to at least the 1830s.<ref name="Bob Ross"/> So, while the name or spelling Shiraz may be an effect of the English language on a French name, there is no evidence that it actually originated in Australia, although it was definitely the Australian usage and the Australian wines that made the use of this name popular.

=== Other legends ===

Another legend of the grape variety's origin, based on the name Syrah, is that it was brought from Syracuse by the legions of Roman Emperor Probus sometime after AD 280. This legend also lacks documentary evidence and is inconsistent with ampelographic findings.<ref name="OCW Rhône"/>

=== Rise to fame ===

The wines that made Syrah famous were those from Hermitage, the hill above the town hermitage (Bordeaux enthusiast Thomas Jefferson, it lost ground and foreign attention in the first half of the 20th century.<ref name="OCW Hermitage">Entry on ''"Hermitage"'' in J. Robinson (ed), ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'', Third Edition, p. 344, Oxford University Press 2006, ISBN 0-19-860990-6</ref>

In the 18th and the first half of the 19th centuries, most Hermitage wine that left France did so as a blending component in Bordeaux wines. In an era when "clarets" were less powerful than today, and before appellation rules, red wines from warmer regions would be used for improvement (or adulteration, depending on the point of view) of Bordeaux wines. While Spanish and Algerian wines are also known to have been used for this purpose, top Bordeaux châteaux would use Hermitage to improve their wines, especially in weaker vintages.<ref name="OCW Adulteraion and fraud">Entry on ''"Adulteraion and fraud"'' in J. Robinson (ed), ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'', Third Edition, p. 4-5, Oxford University Press 2006, ISBN 0-19-860990-6</ref><ref></ref>

=== Arrival in Australia ===

In 1831, the Scotsman James Busby, often called "the Father of Australian viticulture", made a trip back to Europe to collect cuttings from vines (primarily from France and Spain) for introduction to Australia.<ref name="OCW Busby">Entry on ''"Busby, James"'' in J. Robinson (ed), ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'', Third Edition, p. 116, Oxford University Press 2006, ISBN 0-19-860990-6</ref> One of the varieties collected by him was Syrah, although Busby used the two spellings "Scyras" and "Ciras". The cuttings were planted in the Sydney Botanical Gardens, and in Hunter Valley, and in 1839 brought from Sydney to South Australia.<ref name="Syrah WW Austrlia">[http://www.tenimentidalessandro.it/eng/club/SyrahENG.pdf James Halliday: Syrah in Australia since 1800, p. 10-14 in: The Syrah Producers' Club 19 April 2004 - Syrah Worldwide Roma]</ref> By the 1860s, Syrah was established as an important variety in Australia.

=== Modern history ===

Syrah continues to be the main grape of the Northern Rhône and is associated with classic wines such as Hermitage, Cornas and Côte-Rôtie. In the Southern Rhône it is used as a blending grape in such wines as Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Gigondas and Côtes du Rhône, where Grenache usually makes up the bulk of the blend. Although its best incarnations will age for decades, less-extracted styles may be enjoyed young for their lively red and blueberry characters and smooth tannin structure. Syrah has been widely used as a blending grape in the red wines of many countries due to its fleshy fruit mid-palate, balancing the weaknesses of other varieties and resulting in a "complete" wine.´

From the 1970s and even more from the 1990s, Syrah has enjoyed increased popularity, and plantings of the variety has expanded significantly in both old and new locations.<ref name="OCW Syrah"/> In the early 2000s, it broke into the top 10 of varieties planted worldwide for the first time.<ref name="OCW Vine varieties"/>

== Syrah wines ==
thumb|right|A glass of California Syrah.

Shiraz is widely used to make a dry red table wine, which can be both varietal or blended. Four main uses can be distinguished:
* Varietal Syrah or Shiraz. Of the more well-known wines, this is the style of Hermitage in northern Rhône or Australian Shiraz.
* Syrah blended with a small amount of Viognier. This is the traditional style of Côte-Rôtie in northern Rhône.
* Syrah as a roughly equal blending component for Cabernet Sauvignon. In modern times, this blend originated in Australia, so it is often known as Shiraz-Cabernet.
* Syrah as a minor blending component for Châteauneuf-du-Pape of southern Rhône.

Smaller amounts of Syrah are also used for production some other wine styles, such as rosé wine, fortified wine in Port wine style, and sparkling red wine.<ref></ref> While Australian sparkling Shiraz traditionally have had some sweetness, a number of Australian winemakers also make a full-bodied sparkling dry Shiraz, that contains the complexity and sometimes earthy notes that are normally found in still wine.<ref></ref>

Due to their concentrated flavours and high tannin content, many premium Syrah wines are at their best after some considerable time aged in a cellar, 10-15 years or more.

Shiraz has one of the highest recommended wine serving temperatures at 65 °F (18 °C).<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9392760/ The perfect temperature for wine - Wine - MSNBC.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.wineintro.com/types/sirah.html Shiraz / Syrah Wine Information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== Taste and flavours ===
Wines made from Syrah are often quite powerfully flavoured and full-bodied. The variety produces wines with a wide range of flavor notes, depending on the climate and soils where it is grown, as well as other viticultural practices chosen.  Aroma characters can range from violets to berries (usually dark as opposed to red), chocolate, espresso and black pepper. No one aroma can be called "typical" though blackberry and pepper are often noticed. With time in the bottle these "primary" notes are moderated and then supplemented with earthy or savory "tertiary" notes such as leather and truffle.  "Secondary" flavor and aroma notes are those associated with several things, including winemakers' practices (such as oak barrel and yeast regimes), and land terroir qualities.
