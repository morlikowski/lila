'''Mustaparta''' (s. Karibianmerta vuosina 1716—1718. Jotkut kutsuivat häntä nimellä "Paholaisen ruumiillistuma"

== Tausta ==
Mustaparralla on kerrottu olleen neljätoista vaimoa, ja hänet tunnettiin esimerkiksi nimillä Drummond, Thatch ja Tash. Hänen oikean nimensä on kerrottu olleen Edward Teach, alias Edward Thatch. Hän toimi kaapparina, mutta rikkoi sopimusta käymällä laittomasti laivan kimppuun ja ryöstämällä sen. Tosin hän valehteli löytäneensä aluksen hylättynä mereltä seilailemassa, joten häntä ei syyllistetty mitenkään. 

Mustaparta kuvattiin yleensä aseistautuneena miekalla, musketilla ja kuudella pistoolilla. Hänellä oli pitkä musta parta, joka oli palmikoitu. Mustaparran sanotaan laittaneen taistelun alkaessa hattuunsa palavia tulilankoja, jotta häntä ympäröisi musta savu, mutta ensisijaiset lähteet eivät tue tätä teoriaa. 

== Ura ==
Mustaparran uskotaan syntyneen vuoden 1680 tienoilla ja aloittaneen uransa merimiehenä ja matkanneen Jamaikalle. Hänen uskotaan toimineen merirosvo Benjamin Hornigoldin laivalla. Lopulta hänestä tuli laivan kapteeni. Vuonna 1717 Mustaparta ja merirosvo Benjamin Hornigold kaappasivat ranskalaisen Concorden. Mustaparta antoi laivalle nimen Queen Anne's Revenge, ja siitä tuli hänen maineikas lippulaivansa.

== Uran loppu ==
Mustaparran ura merirosvona kesti vain kaksi vuotta, mutta hänet tunnettiin erittäin julmana ja ruuan, lääkkeet ja arvoesineet. Jos laivalla joku vastusti merirosvoja, miehistö ja matkustajat tapettiin.

1718 sotalaiva ''Oracokesalmen lähistölle uskoen matalikon suojaavan hänen alustaan hyökkäyksiltä. Maynard haastoi Mustaparran kaksintaisteluun. Mustaparta hyväksyi tarjouksen. Mustaparta taisteli urhoollisesti huolimatta saamistaan lukuisista haavoista. Lopulta Maynard kuitenkin onnistui tappamaan hänet. Mustaparran ruumiissa kerrottiin olleen kaksikymmentä miekanpistoa ja viisi ampumahaavaa, ennen kuin hän kuoli. Mustaparran pää ripustettiin roikkumaan ''HMS Pearlin'' kokkapuusta.

'''Edward Teach''' (; c. 1689<ref name ="BRP"></ref> – English Atlantic during the early 18th century, a period referred to as the Golden Age of Piracy. His best known vessel was the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'', which is believed to have run aground near Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina in 1718.<ref>[http://www.qaronline.org/education/edintro.htm Queen Anne's Revenge Online]</ref>

Blackbeard often fought, or simply showed himself, wearing a big feathered A General Historie of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates'' that he had pirate.

== Early life ==
Nothing is known about Blackbeard's early life.  The best sources have Blackbeard's real name as Edward Teach. An alternative spelling is '''Edward Thatch'''; another name is '''Edward Drummond'''. Most think Blackbeard was born in Bristol, but some speculate London, Philadelphia, Jamaica, or Accomac County, Virginia as other possible places of birth.<ref name ="BRP" /> Teach went to sea at an early age. He served on an English ship in the War of the Spanish Succession which also included Queen Anne's war, privateering in the Spanish West Indies and along the Spanish Main. After Britain withdrew from the war in 1713, Teach, like many other privateers, turned to piracy. He got his first legs from the pirate Benjamin Hornigold, whose base was in Jamaica. When Hornigold decided to retire from piracy and took the Crown's offer of a pardon, Blackbeard refused the pardon, taking a ship Hornigold captured that same year, a French slave-ship named ''Le Concorde'', (later research revealed that the ship was actually built in Britain) renaming it ''Queen Anne's Revenge''.  Some think that the name was a tribute to the war where he got his first taste of piracy, Queen Anne's War.

According to Charles Johnson, Blackbeard fought a running duel with the British thirty-gun man-of-war ''HMS Scarborough'', which added to his notoriety.  However, historian David Cordingly has noted that the ''Scarborough'''s log has no mention of any such battle.

Blackbeard would plunder merchant ships, forcing them to allow his crew to board their ship. The pirates would seize all of the valuables, food, liquor, and weapons. Despite his ferocious reputation, there are no verified accounts of him actually killing anyone.<ref name="leeson"> "For Blackbeard, at least, this investment paid off. According to historian Angus Konstam who has investigated Blackbeard's life and piratical career extensively, until Blackbeard's final battle with the lieutenant of HMS Pearl, Robert Maynard, who took the bearded icon's life, the world's most notorious and fearsome pirate had not so much as killed a single man (2006: 157). Apparently he didn't need to." pg 21, [http://www.peterleeson.com/Pirational_Choice.pdf "Pirational Choice: The Economics of Infamous Pirate Practices"], Peter T. Leeson</ref> He deliberately cultivated his barbaric reputation, and so could prevail by terror alone.<ref>"Rather than the result of flamboyance, madness, or eccentricity, pirates like Blackbeard deliberately constructed their bizarre and frightful physical appearances to facilitate piratical plunder. "There is no doubt that Blackbeard," for instance, "was conscious of the public image he had created" and worked diligently to maintain it (Lee 1974: 22)." Leeson 2008.</ref>

However, colorful legends and vivid contemporary newspaper portrayals had him committing acts of cruelty and terror. One tale claims he shot his own first mate, saying "if he didn’t shoot one or two crewmen now and then, they’d forget who he was." Another legend is that having had too much to drink, he said to his crew, "Come, let us make a hell of our own, and try how long we can bear it." Going into the ship's hold, they closed the hatches, filled several pots with brimstone and set it on fire. Soon the men were coughing and gasping for air from the sulphurous fumes. All except Blackbeard scrambled out for fresh air. When Blackbeard emerged, he snarled, "Damn ye, ye yellow-bellied sapsuckers! I'm a better man than all ye milksops put together!"<ref>Pendrand, Norman C. (1975) ''Blackbeard: The Fiercest Pirate of All''.</ref> According to Captain Charles Johnson's ''A General History of the Robberies & Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates'': 

Teach had headquarters in both the Bahamas and the Nassau where he was named the magistrate of the "Privateers Republic". Governor Charles Eden of North Carolina received booty from Teach in return for unofficial protection and gave him an official pardon. He left Nassau to avoid meeting with Royal Governor Woodes Rogers, unlike the majority of the pirate inhabitants who welcomed the governor and accepted the royal pardons he brought.

=== Blockade of Charleston ===
Blackbeard's chief claim to fame is his blockade of Charleston, South Carolina. In approximately late May 1718, Blackbeard entered the mouth of Charleston harbour with the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' and three lighter vessels. He plundered five merchant freighters attempting to enter or leave the port. No other vessels could transit the harbour for fear of encountering the pirate squadron.

Aboard one of the ships that Blackbeard captured in the harbor mouth was a group of prominent Charleston citizens, including Samuel Wragg. Blackbeard held these hostages for ransom, making an unusual demand: a chest of medicines. He sent a deputation ashore to negotiate this ransom. Due partly to his envoys' preference for carousing rather than bargaining, the ransom took some days to be delivered, and Blackbeard evidently came close to murdering his prisoners. Eventually, the medicines were turned over, and Blackbeard released the hostages, without their clothing, but otherwise unharmed.  Blackbeard's whole squadron then escaped northward. 

Shortly afterward, Blackbeard ran two of his vessels aground at Topsail Inlet (now Beaufort Inlet), including the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'', and the ship ''Adventure'' when trying to 'save' the grounded ship. He has been accused by many, including his own crew, of doing this deliberately in order to downsize his crew and increase his own share of the treasure. Deliberate or not, he stripped three of the ships of all treasure, beached or marooned most of his crew, and went to Bath, North Carolina, where he finally accepted a pardon under the royal Act of Grace. He then went off to Ocracoke Inlet in the last of his four vessels to enjoy his loot.

=== Death ===
Having accepted a pardon, Teach had apparently retired from piracy.  Nevertheless, Governor Alexander Spotswood of Virginia became concerned that the notorious freebooter lived nearby. Spotswood decided to eliminate Blackbeard, even though he lived outside of Spotswood's jurisdiction.

thumb|left|Blackbeard and Lieutenant MaynardBlackbeard operated in coastal waters; it was difficult for ships of the line to engage him in battle. Two smaller hired sloops were therefore put under the command of Lieutenant Robert Maynard, with instructions from Spotswood to hunt down and destroy Blackbeard, offering a reward of £100, and smaller sums for the lesser crew members.

Maynard sailed from James River on HMS ''Pearl'', and twenty-five men and a midshipman of HMS ''Lyme'', and in command of the hired sloops, the ''Ranger'' and ''Jane'' (temporarily commissioned as His Majesty's Ships to avoid accusations of piracy themselves). Maynard found the pirates anchored in a North Carolina inlet on the inner side of Ocracoke Island, on the evening of November 21.

Maynard and his men decided to wait until the following morning because the tide would be more favourable. Blackbeard's ''Adventure'' had a crew of only nineteen, "Thirteen crackers and six Negroes", as reported to the Admiralty. A small boat was sent ahead at daybreak, was fired upon, and quickly retreated. Blackbeard's superior knowledge of the inlet was of much help, although he and his crew had been drinking in his cabin the night prior. Throughout the night Blackbeard waited for Maynard to make his move. Blackbeard cut his anchor cable and quickly attempted to move towards a narrow channel. Maynard made chase; however his sloops ran aground, and there was a shouted exchange between captains. Maynard's account says, "At our first salutation, he drank Damnation to me and my Men, whom he stil'd Cowardly Puppies, saying, He would neither give nor take Quarter", although many different versions of the dialogue exist.

Eventually, Maynard's sloops were able to float freely again, and he began to row towards Blackbeard, since the wind was not strong enough at the time for setting sail. When they came upon Blackbeard's ''Adventure'', they were hit with a devastating broadside attack. Midshipman Hyde, captain of the smaller ''HMS Jane'', was killed along with six other men. Ten men were also wounded in the surprise attack. The sloop fell astern and was little help in the following action. Maynard continued his pursuit in ''HMS Ranger'', managing to blast the ''Adventure'''s rigging, forcing it ashore. Maynard ordered many of his crew into the holds and readied to be boarded. As his ship approached, Blackbeard saw the mostly empty decks, assumed it was safe to board, and did so with ten men.

Maynard's men emerged, and the battle began. The most complete account of the following events comes from the ''Boston News-Letter'':<ref>{{cite book

Despite the best efforts of the pirates (including a desperate plan to blow up the ''Adventure''), Teach was killed, and the battle ended. Teach was reportedly shot five times and stabbed more than twenty times before he died and was decapitated. Legends about his death immediately sprang up, including the oft-repeated claim that Teach's headless body, after being thrown overboard, swam between 2 and 7 times around the ''Adventure'' before sinking. Teach's head was placed as a trophy on the bowsprit of the ship (it was also required by Maynard to claim his prize when he returned home). After the sheer terror of the battle with the pirates, and the wounds that the crew received, Maynard still only acquired his meager prize of £100 from Spotswood. Later, Teach's head hung from a pike in Bath.
