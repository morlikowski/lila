'''Students For a Free Tibet''' is a non-profit student-led organization that uses nonviolent direct action to work for Tibetan independence. SFT has a strong intention on making Tibet a separate country from China because of China's treatment of Tibetans and what they call "Tibet's historical independence".<ref>http://studentsforafreetibet.org/section.php?id=29</ref>

==Mission Statement==
Students for a Free Tibet (SFT) works in solidarity with the Tibetan people in their struggle for freedom and independence. They are a chapter-based network of young people and activists around the world. Through education, grassroots organizing, and non-violent direct action, they campaign for the Tibetans' political freedom. Their goal is to empower and train youth as leaders in the worldwide movement for social justice.<ref></ref>

==History==
Students for a Free Tibet (SFT) was founded in 1994 by Tibetans, supporters, and students in New York City to use the influence of young people in order to press for human rights and independence in Tibet. Initially, SFT's activities were focused on raising awareness amongst fellow students on campuses and at events such as the 1994 Lollapalooza music tour. Students for a Free Tibet's profile and membership grew with the advent of the Tibetan Freedom Concerts, which provided a vehicle for youth involvement in the Tibetan independence movement.

Currently, SFT is an international network of more than 650 chapters at universities, colleges, high schools and communities in over 100 countries. SFT's International Headquarters remains in New York City.  There are also a few satellite offices and organizing hubs; SFT Canada has an office in Vancouver, British Columbia[http://studentsforafreetibet.org/article.php?list=type&type=88], SFT India has an office in Dharamsala[http://www.sftindia.org], India and SFT UK has an office in London[http://www.sftuk.org].

==Programs==
Students for a Free Tibet defines its core programs in two parts: "Campaigns" and "Leadership Training."

SFT's campaigns focus on three areas: political, economic, and human rights. SFT's political campaigns are focused on generally advocating for Tibetan independence by pressuring both Chinese officials as well as SFT members' government representatives. SFT is well known for high profile protests against Chinese dignitaries when they visit foreign countries. SFT's economic campaigns focus on attempting to prevent foreign corporations and other institutions from assisting China's occupation of Tibet. These efforts have included boycotting Chinese-made goods as well as successfully pressuring the World Bank to cancel a loan for a controversial project involving moving Chinese settlers into a Tibetan area. [http://www.boycottmadeinchina.org/] [http://www.ciel.org/Ifi/pressreleasefinaltibet.html] SFT's human rights campaigns are focused on improving the situation for Tibetans in Tibet by advocating for increased freedoms and rights, and for the release of political prisoners and dissidents.
