The terms ''dog breed'' and ''dog type'' are sometimes used interchangeably, but they have different meanings. A modern ''dog breed'' is standardized, with a documented descent from known ancestors.<ref>{{cite book

A ''dog type'' can be referred to broadly, as in Bird dog, or more specifically, as in Spaniel.

== Origins of dog types ==
:''For the history of the dog, see Dog, Origin of the domestic dog, and Ancient dog breeds''

With the beginnings of agriculture, approximately 12,000 years ago, humans began making use of dogs in various ways. Molecular biologist and founder of the Canine Genome Project Elaine Ostrander comments, "When we became an agricultural society, what we needed dogs for changed enormously, and a further and irrevocable division [between dogs and wolves] occurred at that point."<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> There is a great deal of speculation about the early uses of dogs, but recent genetic analysis shows that the earliest ancestors of modern breeds (those with the least genetic divergence from the ancestral wolf) include hunting dog and working dog types.

The earliest book in the English language to mention dog types was ''The Boke of St. Albans'', written in 1486.<ref>{{cite book

</ref> In a book about hawking, hunting, fishing, and heraldry, the author, Juliana Berners, lists dogs of her time by function. 

Almost one hundred years later, another book was published in English, ''De Canibus Britannicus'', translated from Latin in 1576. The author, John Caius, described  types of dogs in four main categories: hunting dogs, lap dogs, farm dogs, and mongrels. Sub-types describing the function of dogs in each group were also included.

In 1758, ''Systema naturae'' named the domestic dog “familiaris” and added other dog species. More dog types were described as species by Robert Kerr in his English translation of ''Systema naturae'' (''The Animal Kingdom'') in 1792.  Today the species Linnaeus named are identifiable as dog types, not species or subspecies. Some, such as ''Canis aegyptius'', a hairless dog type of Peru, have been documented and registered as breeds (C. l. dingo'', recognized by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN Code). <ref>Don E.

Beginning with the advent of  dog shows in the mid-1800s in England, dog fanciers established stud books and began refining breeds from the various types of dogs in use.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> The attempts to classify dogs into different 'species' shows that dog types could be quite distinctive, from the 'Canis melitaeus' of lapdogs descended from ancient Roman pet dogs to the even more ancient 'Canis molossus', the Molossan types, to the 'Canis saultor', the dancing mongrel of beggars. These types were uniform enough to appear to have been selectively bred, but as Raymond Coppinger wrote, "Natural processes can produce, could produce, and do produce populations of unusual and uniform dogs, that is, dogs with a distinctive conformation."<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> The human manipulation was very indirect. In a very few cases, Emperors or monasteries or wealthy hunters might maintain lines of special dogs, from which we have today Pekinese, St. Bernards, and foxhounds. 

At the beginning of the 1800s there were only a few dogs identified as breeds, but when dog fighting was outlawed in England in 1835, a new sport of dog showing begain. Along with this sport came rules and written records and closed stud books. Some of the old types no longer needed for work (such as the wolfhound) were remade and kept from extinction as show dogs, and other old types were refined into many new breeds. Sometimes multiple new breeds might be born in the same littler of puppies.<ref>The Scottish Terrier, the carin Terrier, and the West Highland White with the same pedigree.{{cite book

'''Hondentype''' is een wat vaag begrip dat zich onttrekt aan de officiële indeling in hondenrassen. Het kan betrekking hebben op een groep rassen (vechthonden, bichons), maar ook wel op een oud  ras in de zin van een bepaald ''slag'' honden (landras). Een hondentype heeft ofwel bepaalde uiterlijke kenmerken gemeen (molossers, naakthonden), ofwel een zelfde functie (sledehonden, rattenvangers). Overigens vallen bij de oude rassen deze twee gezichtspunten vaak samen.

== Indeling naar functie ==
thumb|Husky - lupoïde
thumb|Pointer - braccoïde

De oudst bekende indeling van de huishonden is die van de Brit Johannes Caius uit 1570 (''De Canibus Brittanicus''). Caius onderscheidt 25 rassen, die hij op grond van het gebruik dat van de honden werd gemaakt verdeelt over de volgende groepen:
* jachthonden voor haarwild 
* jachthonden voor veerwild
* schoothonden 
* boerenhonden
* overige honden.

Caius’ aandacht ging vooral uit naar de terriër. Men kan erover twisten welk specifiek ras hier bedoeld is, maar zinvoller is het om Caius’ terriër op te vatten als een type. Evenals de door hem genoemde spaniël en retriever.
