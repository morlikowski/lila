'''NSU Prinz''' var en liten bil med svansmotor tillverkad i olika generationer av NSU Motorenwerke AG 1957-1973.

Första generationen lanserades 1957 och fanns som 2-dörrars sedan och hade en 2-cylindrig, luftkyld radmotor monterad längst bak drivandes på bakhjulen via en 3-växlad växellåda som i början endast hade synkronisering mellan växel 2 och 3. 1958 presenterades en coupé-variant med namnet ''Sport Prinz'', denna designades av Franco Scaglione och Bertone, denna fanns även som cabriolet med wankelmotor och kallades NSU Wankel Spider . 1961 lanserades en ny generation vid namn ''Prinz 4'' med ny kaross, helsynkroniserad växellåda som standard och en större motor, denna tillverkades fram till 1973 och genomgick en ansiktslyftning 1969. Den senare generationen fanns i ett sportutförande kallat ''NSU Prinz TT'' och ''TTS'' med en fyrcylindrig luftkyld OHC-radmotor. En större familjemodell vid namn ''NSU Prinz 110'' presenterades också.

The '''NSU Prinz''' was an automobile produced in Germany by the NSU Motorenwerke AG. The car was built from 1957 to 1973, and received a model change in 1961 (the old model was continued until 1962).

== History ==
The first generation Prinz was available in a saloon body with an upright roof line and seating for four people. The noisy twin cylinder engine was located at the back where it drove the rear wheels via a "crash" gearbox (later versions gained synchromesh). In 1958 a little coupé was added, the Sport Prinz.

The Sport Prinz was designed by Bertone studios in Turin. Approximately 20,831 were manufactured between 1959 and 1967. The first 250 bodies were built by NSU.

First models had the Prinz 30 straight-2 engine (583 cc), later ones had the 598 cc of the Prinz 4.

===NSU Prinz 4===
The NSU Prinz 4 replaced the original Prinz in 1961.  It got a new body, very similar to the Chevrolet Corvair, but of course much smaller. Like the original Prinz, it was powered by a 2-cylinder, air-cooled engine in the rear.  The Prinz 4 was much improved and continued to be a well-engineered car, like its predecessors.  The engine carried on the tradition of eccentric rod driven camshaft inherited from NSU motorcycle engines and interestingly had a dynastart  combined starter/generator built into the crankcase. Later four cylinder engines adopted the more conventional (pre-engaged) separate starter motor and alternator.
 
The NSU Prinz evolved into the somewhat larger bodied NSU 1000, NSU 1000TT, NSU 1200TT and NSU TTS models, introduced in 1963. All had the same body with straight-4 aircooled OHC engines and were frequently driven as sports cars, but also as economical family cars as well. The engines were very lively, and highly reliable. Paired with the low total weight, excellent handling and cornering, both the NSU 1000 and the much higher powered NSU 1200 TT/TTS outperformed many sportscars. Even today more than thirty years later, it remains difficult finding an economical car for seating four to five adults with such high levels of performance, handling, reliability and robustness.

In 1965, an even larger model was added, first called Typ 110, from 1967 on NSU 1200. It offered more space, so it was a better family car, but it was not as sporty as the smaller models. Therefore, the NSU 1200TT used the 1200 cc engine of the 1200, but in the smaller body of the NSU 1000.
    
When NSU was acquired by Beetle and production capacity for the high-class Audi models was needed. The successor of the NSU Prinz became the front-wheel driven Audi 50, later rebadged and continued as Volkswagen Polo.  It was after acquisition of NSU that the VW organisation became known for making affordable modern front-engine cars.
