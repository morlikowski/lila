'''Zemun''' (kyrillisch: ''Земун'', deutsch: ''Semlin'', ungarisch: ''Zimony'') ist ein Stadtbezirk von Belgrad. Er liegt am rechten Ufer der Donau und am linken Ufer der Save. 

== Geschichte ==
thumb|left|Die deutsche Knabenschule von Semlin
In der römischen Kaiserzeit gab es an der Stelle des heutigen Zemun eine Siedlung namens ''Taurunum'', die in den Stürmen der Völkerwanderung untergegangen ist. 

Die ältesten schriftlichen Hinweise über die Stadt datieren aus dem 12. Jh. Der Name entstand aus dem slawischen Wort ''zemlja'' (dt. Erde). Im Mittelalter war Zemun eine eigenständige Stadt an der Südgrenze des Königreichs Ungarn. Sie wurde aber an Bedeutung stets von der am anderen Ufer gelegenen Festung Belgrad übertroffen. Dies war auch während der Zugehörigkeit zum Osmanischen Reich von 1541 bis 1718 so. 

In der folgenden Epoche war Zemun Grenzort und Zollstation der Königreichs Kroatien und Slawonien, ehe es 1918 zu Jugoslawien kam. 

1941-1944 gehörte Zemun zum Unabhängigen Staat Kroatien (deutsches Okkupationsgebiet ''Ostsyrmien'').

Von 1934 bis 1941 und ab 1945 wurde Zemun als Stadtbezirk Teil der serbischen Hauptstadt Belgrad.

'''Zemun''' (German: Semlin, urban neighborhood and one of the 17 municipalities which constitute the City of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is one of 10 urban municipalities, but among them also one of 4 that have both urban and suburban sections.

== Municipality ==
=== Location ===

The municipality is located in the eastern Palilula and Stari Grad across the Danube (north and east, respectively).

=== Geography ===

The municipality is situated along the right bank of the Danube. The bank is mostly marshy in the north so the settlements are built further from the river (Batajnica) separated by hillocks from the river (up to 114 m). The city of Zemun itself was built right on the bank, 100 meters above sea level, on three hills (Kalvarija). These are points of the Zemun loess plateau, an extension of the Syrmia loess plateau, which continues into the crescent-shaped Bežanijska Kosa loess hill on the south-east. The yellow loess is thick up to 40 meters and very fertile, with rich, grass-improved, humus chernozem. The uninhabited river islands of Great War Island and Little War Island on the Danube, belong to Zemun, too. Municipality has an area of 153 km².

=== Population ===

As Zemun grew into one of the most populous neighborhoods of Belgrade, population of the municipality had a steady growth since the World War II. Population of the municipality of Zemun (in present borders) by the official censuses of population:

* 1948 - 42,230

=== Administration ===

Municipality of Zemun became part of the Belgrade City Area (''Teritorija grada Beograda'') with the division of Alexander I on October 3, 1929. On April 1, 1934, municipality itself was absorbed into the municipality of Belgrade, so the post of the president of the municipality of Zemun was abolished and "Zemun section administrator" was appointed to the Belgrade's city government. <br>
In 1941-44 it was occupied by the German army as the ''Okupationsgebiet Ostsyrmien''. Germany technically recognised  Zemun and surroundings as part of the Independent State of Croatia puppet regime but Zemun remained under direct German rule. <br>
After 1945 Zemun was administratively divided into the City of Zemun and Zemun district (srez), unlike rest of Belgrade which was divided into raions. In 1955 both City of Zemun and most of the Zemun district were incorporated into Belgrade again. In 1950s and 1960s, municipalities of Boljevci and Dobanovci were annexed to the municipality of Surčin while Batajnica was annexed to Zemun itself. In 1965 Surčin was annexed to the municipality of Zemun which marked the largest territorial expansion of Zemun (438 km²). However, on November 24, 2003 Belgrade City assembly voted to re-create the municipality of Surčin, but it remained under the administration of Zemun until November 3, 2004, when separate municipal government was established after the local elections. A motion for Batajnica to split from Zemun too was active for a while in early 2000s (see List of former and proposed municipalities of Belgrade).
