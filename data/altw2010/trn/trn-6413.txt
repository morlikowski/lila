A '''tipi''' (also '''teepee''', '''tepee''') is a conical Native Americans of the stereotypically associated with Native Americans in general, but Native Americans from places other than the Great Plains used different types of dwellings.  The term wigwam is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to a dwelling of this type.

The tipi was durable, provided warmth and comfort in winter, was dry during heavy rains, and was cool in the heat of summer.  Tipis could be disassembled and packed away quickly when a tribe decided to move, and could be reconstructed quickly when the tribe settled in a new area.  This portability was important to those Plains Indians who had a nomadic lifestyle.

Modern tipi covers are usually made of historical reenactors, back-to-the-land devotees, and Native American families attending Powwows or Encampments who wish to preserve and pass on a part of their heritage and tradition.

The word "tipi" comes into English from the enclitic (a suffix-like ending that marks the subject of the verb as plural), ''pi'', and means "they dwell." In Lakota, formal verbs can be used as nouns, and this is the case with ''thípi'', which in practice just means "house."

==Elements==

Tipis consist of four elements: a set of ten to twenty sapling poles (depending on the size of the tipi), a canvas or hide cover (the outer shape familiar from photographs), an optional inner canvas or skin lining, and a canvas or skin door.  There may also be an optional partial ceiling. This was  called an ozan; however, it is now found that the word ozan refers to the liner. 
Ropes and pegs are required to bind the poles, close the cover, attach the lining and door, and anchor the resulting structure to the ground. Tipis are distinguished from other tents by two crucial innovations: the opening at the top and the smoke flaps, which allow the dweller to cook and heat themselves with an open fire, and the lining that is primarily used in the winter, which insulates while providing a source of fresh air to fire and dwellers. Tipis are designed to be easily set up to allow camps to be moved to follow game migrations, especially the bison. The long poles could be used to construct a dog- or later horse-pulled travois. 

Tipi covers are made by sewing together strips of canvas or hide and cutting out a semicircular shape from the resulting surface. Trimming this shape yields a trapezoid-shaped strips of canvas assembled to form the shape of a truncated cone. The poles, made of peeled, polished and dried tapering saplings, are cut to measure about six feet more than the radius of the cover.

The construction of a tipi starts with tying together three of the poles at the skin's tripod lashing. One end of this lashing rope is left dangling from the tie-point, long enough to reach the base of the poles. These tripod poles are stood upright, with their unfastened ends spaced apart on the ground to form a triangle, each pole's base the skin's radius from its neighbors. A dozen more long poles are laid onto the three primary poles. Their upper ends rest on the lashing of the first three, and the lower ends are evenly spaced to form a circle on the ground which includes the original three poles. The lashing rope is then walked around the whole structure three times and pulled tight. This ties the placed poles to the tripod at the crown of the tipi. The canvas skin is tied to another pole, lifted up and the top of the pole is rested where all the poles meet. The skin is pulled around the pole framework. The overlap seam is closed with wooden lacing pins which are thin sticks about 10 inches long with one or both ends tapered. Sometimes a door is attached to one of the bottom lacing pins. In old tipis of hide or early cloth, the door was where the two sides came together in the front. A blanket, hide or cloth door was put over the opening to secure the entrance.

The base of the skin is pegged to the ground. Traditionally pegs were placed in slits at the bottom of the cover.  As canvas or cloth came into use loops were sewn into the bottom or, in an emergency smooth pebbles were pushed into the cloth and a cord tied between the bulge of cloth and a wooden peg in the ground. A gap can be allowed at ground level for airflow in warm seasons and the base is completely closed to the ground in cooler times. The bases of the non-tripod poles are moved in or out to tension the skin.  Inside the tipi, a cord is wrapped from pole to pole above head height. An inner lining can be suspended from this cord and pushed back on the ground near the inside base of the poles. Bedding and personal items are pushed against the liner to keep it in place. The inner lining acts as a heat insulator and draft and pest excluder.  An interior awning which prevents rain drops hitting bedding can be suspended at the top of the lining.

right|thumb|271px|Examples of painted tipi covers.  From [[Paul Goble’s book, Tipi: Home of the Nomadic Buffalo Hunters, World Wisdom, 2007.]]

Most tipis in a village would not be painted.  Those that were, were typically painted in accordance with traditional tribal designs and often featured geometric portrayals of celestial bodies and animal designs.  Sometimes tipis were painted to depict personal experiences, such as war or hunting.  In the case of a dream or vision quest, “ceremonies and prayers were first offered, and then the dreamer recounted his dream to the priests and wise men of the community…  Those known to be skilled painters were consulted, and the new design was made to fit anonymously within the traditional framework of [the tribe’s] painted tipis.” <ref>{{cite book

Le '''tipi''' (de l'Nord-Amérindiennes.

== Conception ==
thumb|right|Village de tipis.

Un '''tipi''' est composé de longues tiges de bois appuyées les unes sur les autre puis recouvertes de peaux d'animaux.
Utilisé par les lakota ''Tipi'' qui veut dire habitat, maison) est considéré comme l'abri le plus ingénieux que l'espèce humaine ait inventé. Contrairement à ce que l'on pourrait croire, c'est un abri spacieux, propre, qui protège du froid ou de la chaleur grâce à un système de ventilation. Il suffit environ de 10 à 12 peaux de tribu. Certains tipis pouvaient être fait de 50 peaux et abritaient les conseils et réunions tribales. 
Après une année, les tipis devaient être réparés, voir entièrement reconstitués car la peau s'affinait avec le temps.  La décoration d'un tipi varie suivant la tribu et aussi suivant l'histoire que l'on veut raconter. La femme est traditionnellement propriétaire du tipi.

L'armature est souvent faite de 13 perches (nombre symbolique), qui peuvent être peintes en rouge. La tente est fixée au sol par des piquets ou des pierres. On entre par une porte en peau décorée, sur laquelle figure le totem du propriétaire. Le tipi peut être aussi orné de  trophées de chasse et de scalp. L'intérieur est plutôt simple et répond aux exigences de la vie nomade. On dort sur une couchette en peau de bison ou d'ours, étendue sur un sommier de joncs tressés. Le foyer se situe au centre ; il est entouré de pierres et chauffe un récipient posé sur un trépied en bois. Le mobilier se compose de sacs en peau, de coffres à viande et de poteries.
