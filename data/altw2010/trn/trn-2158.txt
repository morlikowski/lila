'''Peter Bogdanovich''' (American director, writer, actor and critic. He was part of the wave of "New Hollywood" directors (which included William Friedkin, Brian DePalma, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Michael Cimino and Francis Ford Coppola, among others), and was particularly relevant during the 1970s with his film ''The Last Picture Show''. 

==Early life==
The son of immigrants fleeing the Nazis -- his father is a cinema-goer, sometimes seeing up to 400 movies a year in his youth, Bogdanovich prominently showcased the work of American directors such as John Ford, whom he subsequently wrote a book about based on the notes he had produced for the MoMA retrospective of the director, and the then-underappreciated Howard Hawks. Bogdanovich also brought attention to such forgotten pioneers of American cinema as Allan Dwan. 

Bogdanovich was influenced by the French critics of the 1950s who wrote for ''Esquire''. These articles were collected in "Pieces of Time" (1973). In 1968, following the example of ''Cahiers du Cinéma'' critics Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, and Éric Rohmer who had created the Nouvelle Vague ("New Wave") by making their own films, Bogdanovich decided to become a director. With his wife Polly Platt in tow, they packed their bags, took a grocery carriage full of books and loaded them into their car and headed for Los Angeles, skipping out on their rent in the process. Intent on getting into the industry, Bogdanovich's persistence paid off when he would bug publicists for movie premiere and industry party invites. At one screening, Bogdanovich was viewing a film with film director Roger Corman sitting behind him. The two struck up a conversation when Corman mentioned he liked a cinema piece Bogdanovich wrote for Esquire. It was in this conversation that Corman offered him a directing job which Bogdanovich didn't even blink before accepting. He went on to work with Corman on ''Targets'' and ''Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women''. Bogdanovich later said of the Corman school of filmmaking, "I went from getting the laundry to directing the picture in three weeks. Altogether, I worked 22 weeks – preproduction, shooting, second unit, cutting, dubbing – I haven't learned as much since."<ref>[http://www.moviemaker.com/issues/42/corman-learned.html "What They Learned From Roger Corman"], by Beverly Gray, ''Moviemaker Magazine'', Spring 2001, retrieved April 29, 2006</ref>

Turning back to journalism, Bogdanovich struck up a life-long friendship with Catch-22''. Bogdanovich played a major role in elucidating Welles and his career with his writings on the actor-director, most notably his book ''This is Orson Welles'' (1992). In the early '70s when Welles was having financial problems, Bogdanovich let him stay at his Bel Air mansion for a couple of years.

In 1970, Bogdanovich was commissioned by the James Stewart, TCM released it in 2006, featuring newer, pristine film clips, and additional interviews with Clint Eastwood, Walter Hill, Harry Carey, Jr., Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and others.

==Eruption into stardom==
The 32-year old Bogdanovich was hailed by a critics as a "Wellesian" wunderkind when his best known film, ''The Last Picture Show'', was released in 1971.  The film received eight Academy Awards nominations, including Best Director, and won two statues: Cloris Leachman and Ben Johnson in the supporting acting categories. Bogdanovich, who had cast the 19-year-old model Cybill Shepherd in a major role in the film, fell in love with her, an affair that eventually led to his divorce from Polly Platt, his long-time artistic collaborator and the mother of his two children. 

Bogdanovich followed up ''The Last Picture Show'' with the popular hit ''What's Up, Doc?'' (1972) starring Paper Moon'' (1973) was produced.

''Paper Moon'', a Depression-era comedy starring Ryan O'Neal that won his 10-year-old daughter Daisy Miller'', a film that had a lackluster critical reception.

==Commercial demise==
An adaptation of the Daisy Miller'' (1974) spelled the beginning of the end of Bogdanovich's career as a popular, critically acclaimed director. The film, which starred Bogdanovich's lover Shepherd as the title character, was savaged by critics and was a flop at the box office. Bogdanovich's follow-up, an original screenplay (set to the music of Cole Porter), ''At Long Last Love'' (1975) starring Shepherd, was panned by critics as one of the worst films ever made and noted as such in Harry and Michael Medved's ''The Golden Turkey Awards: Nominees and Winners, the Worst Achievements in Hollywood History'' (1980). The film also was a box office bomb despite featuring Burt Reynolds, whose star would only rise during the 1970s. 

Once again beholden to the past, Bogdanovich insisted on filming the musical numbers for ''At Long Last Love'' live, a process not used since the early days of the talkies. The decision was widely ridiculed as none of the leading actors were known for their singing abilities. (Bogdanovich himself had produced a critically panned album of Shepherd singing Porter songs in 1974.) The public perception of Bogdanovich became that of an arrogant director hamstrung by his own hubris. 

Bogdanovich turned back again to old triumphs and traditions with ''Nickelodeon'' (1976), a comedy recounting the earliest days of the motion picture industry and reuniting ''Paper Moon'''s Ryan and Tatum O'Neal with Reynolds. Counseled not to use the critically unpopular Shepherd in the film, Bogdanovich instead used newcomer Jane Hitchcock as the film's ingénue. Unfortunately, the magic of ''Paper Moon'' could not be repeated and the film died at the box office.

==The Dorothy Stratten affair==
After a three-year hiatus, Bogdanovich returned with the critically and financially underwhelming ''Saint Jack'' (1979) for Hugh Hefner's Playboy Productions Inc. Bogdanovich's long affair with Shepherd had ended in 1978, but the production deal making Hefner the film's producer was part of the settlement of a lawsuit Shepherd had filed against Hefner for publishing nude photos of her pirated from a print of ''The Last Picture Show'' in Playboy Magazine. Bogdanovich then launched the film that would be his career Waterloo, ''They All Laughed'', a low-budget ensemble comedy starring Audrey Hepburn and the 20 year-old Playboy Playmate of the Year Dorothy Stratten. During the filming of the picture, Bogdanovich fell in love with Stratten, who was married to Paul Snider. Stratten moved in with Bogdanovich, and when she told Snider she was leaving him, she was killed in a murder-suicide.

''They All Laughed'' could not attract a distributor due to the negative publicity surrounding the Stratten murder, despite its being one of the few films made by the legendary Audrey Hepburn after her provisional retirement in 1967. The heartbroken Bogdanovich bought the rights to the negative so that it would be seen by the public, but the film had a limited release to weak reviews and lost Bogdanovich millions, driving him into bankruptcy.  Apart from the tragic circumstances of its making, though, the film has a small but devoted following.  Director Quentin Tarantino listed it as one of the Ten Best Films of All Time in the 2002 Sight and Sound poll.

==Later years==
Bogdanovich turned back to writing as his directorial career sagged, beginning with memoir of his dead love, ''The Killing of the Unicorn: Dorothy Stratten (1960&ndash;1980)'' that was published in 1984. Teresa Carpenter's "Death of a Playmate" article about Stratten's murder had been published in ''The Village Voice,'' and had won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize. While Bogdanovich never criticized Carpenter's article in his book, she had lambasted Bogdanovich and Hefner, claiming that Stratten was as much a victim of them as she was of Snider. In particular she criticized Bogdanovich for his "puerile preference for ingenues." Carpenter's article served as the basis of Bob Fosse's film ''Star 80'' (1983), in which Bogdanovich, for legal reasons, was portrayed as the fictional director "Aram Nicholas," a sympathetic but possibly misguided and naive character.

On December 30, 1988 49 year old Bogdanovich married then 20 year old ''Louise Stratten,'' the younger sister of the murdered Playboy playmate/actress ''Dorothy Stratten'' whom he had been dating a few years after ''Dorothy Strattons's'' death. Louise had been 12 years old at the time of her sister Dorothy's death.  Louise and Peter were divorced in 2001. 

Though he achieved huge success with ''Mask'' in 1985, Bogdanovich's sequel to ''The Last Picture Show'', ''Texasville'' (1990), was a critical and box office disappointment.  Both films occasioned major disputes between Bogdanovich, who still demanded a measure of control over his films, and the studios, which now exerted control over the finance and final cut of both films. ''Mask'' was released with a song score by Bob Seger against Bogdanovich's wishes (he favored Bruce Springsteen), and Bogdanovich has often complained that the version of ''Texasville'' that was released was not the film he had intended to release. A director's cut of ''Mask'', slightly longer and with the songs of Springsteen, was belatedly released on DVD in 2006. A director's cut of ''Texasville'' was released on laserdisc, though it has never been released on DVD. Around the time of the release of ''Texasville'', Bogdanovich also re-visited his earliest success, ''The Last Picture Show'', and produced a slightly modified director's cut. Since that time, his re-cut has been the only available version of the film.

Bogdanovich directed two more theatrical films in 1992 and 1993, but their failure kept him off the big screen for several years. One, ''River Phoenix's last roles before an untimely drug-related death.
