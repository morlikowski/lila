'''Minigolf''' er en golfkølle (ofte en putter) og en ball på en ferdiglaget bane der hindringene er faste og tildels vanskelige å passere samtidig som ballen skal i hullet. Hensikten med spillet er å slå ballen fra utslagsstedet til hullet i banen på ferrest mulig slag.

I konkurranser spilles det med ulike baller utfra hvilke hinder man spiller mot. Ballene velges utfra hardhet, vekt og sprett. Ballenes diameter skal være mellom 37 mm og 43 mm.

Det spilles normalt på filt, eternitt eller betongbaner. Baner med eternittdekke benevnes Europabaner. En minigolfbane kan bestå av fra 9 til 18 småbaner som er lagt ut enten på flatt underlag, eller i småkupert terreng. Banene skal være minst 80 cm brede og minst 5,5 m lange.

==Regler==
Ballen legges på ett avmerket utslagssted og slås med køllen mot hullet. Det maksimale antall slag på en bane er 7. Dersom ballen hopper ut av banen legges den tilbake i banen der den gikk ut. Det tilkommer ikke ekstraslag for baller som går ut. 

Banene har en rødfarget grenselinje som ballen må krysse for at man skal slippe å legge ballen tilbake på utslagsstedet. Når ballen er slått forbi den grenselinjen kan ballen slås videre mot hullet fra det stedet den stoppet. Dersom ballen bli liggende nær vantet kan den legges ut i spillbart område på banen. Det spillbare området er markert med svart stiplet linje.

'''Minigolf''', or '''miniature golf''', is a miniature version of the Putt-Putt is the trademark of an American company<ref>[http://www.puttputt.com/ Welcome to Putt Putt Fun Centers!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> that builds and franchises miniature golf courses and Family Entertainment Centers. The term "Minigolf" was formerly a registered trademark of a Swiss company that built its own patented type of minigolf courses.<ref>[http://www.minigolfsport.se/bganormy.htm#ch BANGOLF - Bangolf - bangolf - UPPKOMST OCH UTVECKLING<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== The Game ==

There are different types of minigolf courses. In USA and United Kingdom the minigolf courses typically use similar designs as the greens (putting areas) of golf, having an oddly-shaped green area (made of felt rather than grass), and obstacles made of stone and sand.<ref>[http://www.miniaturegolfer.com/belfast.html Belfast, Adventure Golf - The Captain's Challenge<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Many minigolf courses in these countries also include fantasy obstacles such as wind-mills, dinosaurs, and just about anything imaginable, hence the UK term:' ''crazy'' golf'.<ref>[http://www.miniaturegolfer.com/hemsby.html Hemsby Lost World Adventure Golf and Stonehenge the BIG mini golf<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Course design===
In mainland Europe nearly all minigolf courses are geometrically shaped, which gives them a visual appearance very much unlike the greens (putting areas) of golf. In Scandinavia minigolf courses usually have a rectangular wooden frame and a felt surface.<ref>[http://www.minigolfpics.com/html/courses_sweden_ornskoldsvik.html]</ref> In central and southern Europe the minigolf courses most commonly have a steel frame and a surface made of beton<ref>[http://www.minigolfpics.com/html/courses_italy_vergiate.html]</ref> or eternite<ref>[http://www.minigolfpics.com/html/courses_luxembourg_luxembourg.html]</ref> (which is hardened special beton).

As in golf, courses usually have nine or eighteen holes (or less commonly twelve), and the object is to hit the minigolf ball into the hole with as few strokes as possible. The distance to the hole from the starting area is rarely more than 10 meters in minigolf (while in regular golf the hole is up to 200 meters (656 feet) away from the starting area, or tee). Due to the short distance, minigolfers rarely use other golf clubs than the putter. Iron chippers are used on hole number 7 in the standardized beton courses (used in international competitions), which has a 30m long fairway of natural grass, and a round green made of beton.<ref>[http://www.minigolfpics.com/pictures/courses/netherlands_geldrop/concrete07.jpg]</ref>

Minigolf is less expensive and much easier than golf, and is therefore a popular pastime for adults and children of all ages. The costs of building a minigolf course are less than 10% of the costs of a golf course. Also the admission tickets to minigolf courses are remarkably cheaper than the admission tickets to golf courses. For these economical reasons, the number of minigolf courses and occasional players of minigolf is many times greater than the number of golf courses and golf players. In Germany alone there are several thousand minigolf courses, and 15 million Germans play at least one round of minigolf during each year.<ref>[http://www.miniaturegolfer.com/minigolf_olympics.html Minigolf: From Summer Holidays to the Summer Olympics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

There are also portable minigolf courses. These are usually set up temporarily for competitions, summer family events, product launches and corporate team-building events. Swedish felt and eternite courses are semi-portable and often used for seasonal use outdoors, but custom-built portable courses such as those designed and built by special minigolf companies are used indoors and outdoors throughout the year. They are extremely popular with people of all ages and skills.<ref>[http://www.urbancrazy.com/]</ref>

==History==
===Origins===
It is a matter of taste which activity one wants to call "minigolf" rather than "golf", but probably the best candidate as the "first minigolf course in the world" is the Ladies' Putting Club<ref>[http://www.victoriana.com/golf/ladiesgolfclub.html The St. Andrews Ladies' Golf Club<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> of St. Andrews in Scotland, which was founded in 1867, and still today is operating and open for public. This 18-hole course of putting greens, called "the Himalayas", was founded by some members of the notable Royal & Ancient Golf Club in St. Andrews. Women had become interested in golf game, but the conservative social norms of the era deemed it unacceptable for women to publicly perform such violent movements that a golf swing requires.<ref name="haeber">[http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~haeber/creations/minigolf.html History of Miniature Golf<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Therefore an 18-hole course of short putting greens was constructed for women &ndash; apparently the first "miniature golf course" in the world.

A few decades later it became customary for many American and British hotels to offer their guests a miniature-sized golf course, using the same designs as actual golf courses, but at one tenth the scale. The game was played with a golf putter and a short driver, and was called "garden golf", "pitch and putt golf", "clock golf" or "par 3 golf".<ref name="haeber"/>

Geometrically-shaped minigolf courses made of fake materials began to emerge during the early 20th century. The earliest documented mention of such a course is in the 8 June 1912 edition of The Illustrated London News, which introduces a minigolf course called Gofstacle.<ref>[http://www.miniaturegolfer.com/gofstacle.html The Illustrated London News June 8 1912<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The first standardized minigolf courses to enter commercial mass-production were the Pinehurst, North Carolina, and the 1927 Tom Thumb patent of Garnet Carter from Lookout Mountain, Tennessee. Thomas McCulloch Fairbairn, a golf fanatic, revolutionized the game in 1922 with his formulation of a suitable artificial green&mdash;a mixture of cottonseed hulls, sand, oil, and dye. With this discovery, miniature golf became accessible everywhere; by the late 1920s there were over 150 rooftop courses in New York City alone, and tens of thousands across the United States. This American minigolf boom of early 20th century came to an end during the economical depression in the late 1930s. Nearly all minigolf courses in the United States were closed and demolished before the end of 1930s.<ref name="haeber"/>

===European origins=== 

<p>One of the first documented minigolf courses in mainland Europe was built in 1926 by Fr. Schr&ouml;der in Hamburg, Germany. Mr. Schr&ouml;der had been inspired by his visit to the United States, where he had seen minigolf courses spreading across the country.<ref name="bganormy">[http://www.minigolfsport.se/bganormy.htm#ty BANGOLF - Bangolf - bangolf - UPPKOMST OCH UTVECKLING<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></p>

In 1930 the gentlemen Edwin O. Norrman and Eskil Norman returned to Sweden from the United States, where they had stayed for several years and witnessed the golden days of the American minigolf boom. In 1931 they founded a company "Norman och Norrmans Miniatyrgolf", and began manufacturing standardized minigolf courses for the Swedish market. During the following years they spread this new leisure activity across Sweden, by installing minigolf courses in public parks and other suitable locations.<ref name="bganormy"/>

Swedish minigolf courses typically had a rectangular wooden frame surrounding the playing area made of tennis field sand<ref>[http://www.citygolf.se/english/history.html The history of minigolf<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (while the American manufacturers used newly-developed and patented felt as the surface of their minigolf courses). Felt did not become popular as a surface material in Sweden until in the mid-1960s &ndash; but since then it has become practically the only surface material used in Scandinavia and Britain, due to its favourable playing qualities in wet weather. (Minigolf courses with a felt surface can be played also in rainy weather, because water is absorbed through the felt into the ground. The other commonly used surface materials, beton and eternite, cannot be used in rainy weather, because the rainwater collects into large pools on them, stopping the ball from rolling.)

The Swedish Minigolf Federation (Svenska Bangolfförbundet)<ref>[http://www.bangolf.se/ Svenska Bangolfförbundet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> was founded in 1937, being the oldest minigolf sport organization in the world. National Swedish championships in minigolf have been played yearly since 1939.<ref>[http://www.minigolfsport.se/historik/bgresumy.htm]</ref> In other countries minigolf sport federations were not founded until the late 1950s, due to the post-war economical depression (from which Sweden was largely spared due to its successful neutral non-militant policy during the World Wars).

===Competitive games=== 
The earliest documented minigolf competitions were played in the United States, however. The first National Tom Thumb Open minigolf tournament was arranged in 1930, with a total cash purse $10,000 (the top prize being $2,000). Qualification play-offs were played in all of the 48 states, and the final competition on Lookout Mountain, Chattanooga, Tennessee attracted over 200 players representing thirty states.<ref>[http://prominigolf.com/history.html Welcome to US ProMiniGolf Association - The Official Internet Site For Prominigolf<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> After the Depression ten years later, minigolf died out as a competition sport in America, and has begun to recover only during the most recent decades. Luckily enough, the American minigolf sport boom of 1930s inspired many European countries, and the fire of minigolf sport lived on in Europe even after the American game fell into Depression.

=== Post-Depression USA ===

In 1938 Joseph and Robert Taylor from Binghamton, New York started building and operating their own miniature golf courses. These courses differed from the ones in the late 20s and early 30s; they were no longer just rolls, banks, and curves, with an occasional pipe thrown in. Their courses not only had landscaping, but also obstacles, including windmills, castles, and wishing wells. 

Impressed by the quality of the courses, many customers asked if the Taylors would build a course for them. By the early 1940s, Joe and Bob formed Taylor Brothers, and were in the business of building miniature golf courses and supplying obstacles to the industry.
During both the Korean and Vietnam Wars, many a G.I. played on a Taylor Brothers prefabricated course that the U.S. Military had contracted to be built and shipped overseas. 

By the late 50s most&mdash;if not all&mdash;supply catalogs carried Taylor Brothers' obstacles. In 1961 Bob Taylor, Don Clayton of Putt-Putt, and Frank Abramoff of Arnold Palmer Miniature Golf organized the first miniature golf association known as NAPCOMS (or the "National Association of Putting Course Operators, Manufacturers, and Suppliers"). Their first meeting was held in New York City. Though this organization only lasted a few years it was the first attempt to bring miniature golf operators together to promote miniature golf.  

In 1955, Lomma Enterprises, Inc., founded by Al Lomma and his brother Ralph Lomma, led the revival of wacky, animated trick hazards. These hazards required both accurately aimed shots and split-second timing to avoid spinning windmill blades, revolving statuary, and other careening obstacles.

The book ''Tilting At Windmills (How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love Sport)'' by Andy Miller tells the story of the formerly sports-hating author attempting to change by competing in miniature golf, including events in Denmark and Latvia.

In the celebration on May 12, 2007, and will be officially recognized and published in 2008's edition of ''Chase's Calendar of Events''. ''Chase's'' is published by McGraw-Hill.
