Os '''Textos da Pirâmide''' de Unas, descobertos em 1881 por Gaston Maspero, são os escritos religiosos mais antigos descobertos até hoje. Por apresentarem uma síntese das crenças religiosas do  Antigo Egito, eles datam de 4.500 anos ou mais, considerando que estas crenças devem ter nascido muito antes de serem transcritas na pedra.

Embora a Pirâmide de Unas seja a menor das pirâmides reais construídas no Antigo Império, ela foi a primeira a trazer em suas paredes internas este conjunto de encantamentos (fórmulas), que ajudariam a alma do faraó em sua jornada para o próximo mundo.
Os textos estão gravados nas colunas, sobre as paredes do corredor, da ante-câmara e da passagem que leva à câmara funerária da pirâmide. As paredes que cercam o sarcófago não têm texto e o teto é coberto por estrelas.

Os Textos da Pirâmide de Unas estão dispostos na tumba do Oeste para o Leste, simbolizando a crença que o reino dos mortos ficava no Ocidente - a maioria das necropoles estão dispostas na margem oeste do Nilo - e o Sol, associado à Ressureição por reaparecer vivificado após o seu trajeto noturno, ressurge sempre no Oriente.

The '''Pyramid Texts''' are a collection of ancient Egyptian religious texts from the time of the sarcophagi of the 5th and 6th Dynasties of the Old Kingdom.  The oldest of the texts date to between 2400-2300 BCE.<ref></ref>Unlike the Coffin Texts and Book of the Dead into which parts of the pyramid texts later evolved, the pyramid texts were reserved only for the pharaoh and were not illustrated.<ref name=Lichtheim></ref> The pyramid texts mark the first written mention of the god Osiris, who would become the most important deity associated with afterlife.<ref name=BOD></ref>

The spells, or "utterances", of the pyramid texts are primarily concerned with protecting the pharaoh's remains, reanimating his body after death, and helping him ascend to the heavens, which are the emphasis of the afterlife during the Old Kingdom. The spells delineate all of the ways the pharaoh could travel, including the use of ramps, stairs, ladders, and most importantly flying. The spells could also be used to call the gods to help, even threatening them if they did not comply.<ref name=JPAllenMiddleEgyptian></ref>
==Versions==
The texts were first discovered in 1881 by Kurth Sethe (in German), Louis Speelers (in French), Raymond O. Faulkner, and Samuel Alfred Browne Mercer. 

The oldest version consists of 228 spells and comes from the Pyramid of Kurt Sethe's first edition of the pyramid texts contained 714 distinct spells; after this publication additional spells were discovered bringing the total to 759. No single collection uses all recorded spells.

==Examples==
After death, the king must first rise from his tomb. Utterance 373 describes:<ref name=Lichtheim />
:''Oho! Oho! Rise up, O Teti!''
:''Take your head, collect your bones,''
:''Gather your limbs, shake the earth from your flesh!''
:''Take your bread that rots not, your beer that sours not,''
:''Stand at the gates that bar the common people!''

:''The gatekeeper comes out to you, he grasps your hand,''
:''Takes you into heaven, to you father Geb.''
:''He rejoices at your coming, gives you his hands,''
:''Kisses you, caresses you,''
:''Sets you before the spirits, the imperishable stars...''
:''The hidden ones worship you,''
:''The great ones surround you,''
:''The watchers wait on you,''
:''Barley is threshed for you,''
:''Emmer is reaped for you,''
:''Your monthly feasts are made with it,''
:''Your half-month feasts are made with it,''
:''As ordered done for you by Geb, your father,''
:''Rise up, O Teti, you shall not die!''

The texts then describe several ways for the pharaoh to reach the heavens, and one of these is by climbing a ladder. In utterance 304 the king says:<ref name=Lichtheim />
:''Hail, daughter of Anubis, above the hatches of heaven,''
:''Comrade of Thoth, above the ladder's rails,''
:''Open Unas's path, let Unas pass!''

Another way is by ferry. If the boatman refuses to take him, the king has other plans:
:''If you fail to ferry Unas,''
:''He will leap and sit on the wing of Thoth,''
:''Then'' he '' will ferry Unas to that side!''

===The cannibal hymn===
Utterances 273 and 274 are sometimes known as the "cannibal hymn", because it describes the king hunting and eating parts of the gods:<ref name=Lichtheim />
:''A god who lives on his fathers,'' 
:''who feeds on his mothers...''

:''Unas is the bull of heaven''
:''Who rages in his heart,''
:''Who lives on the being of every god,''
:''Who eats their entrails''
:''When they come, their bodies full of magic''
:''From the Isle of Flame...''
