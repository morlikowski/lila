'''クヌート'''（独：Knut）は2006年12月5日にドイツのベルリン動物園で生まれたホッキョクグマである。母グマのトスカ（独：Tosca）が育児放棄したため、飼育係がクヌートと同時に生まれたもう1頭を母グマから引き離し（もう1頭は生後4日目に死亡）、人工哺育を行った。ドイツ国内のみならず世界中での人気を集めている。

== 生い立ち ==
母親は東ドイツの国営サーカスで芸をしていたトスカ（20歳）で、父親はミュンヘン動物園生まれのラルス（13歳）。トスカは前年の2005年にも三つ子を出産していたがこのときも育児放棄している。2006年12月5日、トスカは双子を出産するが再び出産直後に仔グマを遺棄したため、飼育係と獣医が双子を救出、人工哺育にきりかえた。クヌートの兄弟は生後4日目に感染症により死亡するが、クヌートは生後44日を人工保育器の中で過ごすものの、その後順調に成長している。

2007年1月末に元気な姿がマスコミで披露されると、ドイツ国内で一躍人気者となった。2月末以降、ベルリンのテレビ局RDDによるテレビ番組シリーズの開始や、公式サイトおよびブログなどの立ち上げ後は、その人気が海外へも波及。とりわけ3月23日の一般公開後には、飼育係と遊ぶ愛らしい姿が人気を集め、ドイツの新聞雑誌などで特集記事が組まれるほか、アメリカの雑誌『Vanity Fair』の表紙にも登場した。DVDやぬいぐるみ、お菓子など関連商品も多数発売されている。

また、ベルリン動物園は株式会社であり、地元のベルリン・ブレーメン取引所に上場している。水族館入場権付きの同株式は一時2000ユーロ（約32万円）近辺を推移していたが、3月23日の一般公開後、メディアがクヌートの映像を流すと株価が急騰し、4月3日の終値の時点で4660ユーロ（約74万5600円）となった。

== 安楽死をめぐる論争 ==
「動物愛護団体がホッキョクグマの人工哺育は種のあり方に反するため、クヌートを安楽死させろと主張している」との捏造記事が発端となり、人工哺育や動物園のあり方についての議論がドイツ国内外で巻き起こった。

ドイツの大衆芸能紙「ビルト」が2006年1月26日付けで、動物愛護活動家フランク・アルブレヒトが人工哺育はシロクマの種のあり方にふさわしくないため、クヌートを薬殺処分するべきだと主張しているとの記事を掲載した<ref>[http://www.bild.t-online.de/BTO/news/2007/01/26/eisbaer-knut-drama/tierschuetzer-tod.html Armer, süßer Eisbär Knut Tierschützer fordert seinen Tod]</ref>。当初はこの記事が特に注目を集めることはなかったが、3月下旬の一般公開直前にドイツの週刊誌「シュピーゲル」があらためてこの記事を取り上げ、他の多くのメディアが同記事を引用したことから、「安楽死の是非」についての議論が巻き起こった<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,472480,00.html Der Spiegel "IS BERLIN'S POLAR BEAR BABY TOO HUMAN? Knut Should Be Killed, Say Some Animal Activists"]</ref>。さらに各通信社によって世界中に「一部の動物愛護団体が、シロクマの人口哺育は自然の法則に反すると安楽死を主張したが、動物園側はこれに反論。ドイツでは人口飼育の是非をめぐって論争になっている」として配信されたため、世界各国でも大きく報じられた。この議論に対してアーヘン動物園長のヴォルフラム・グラフ＝ルドルフをはじめ、他の動物園関係者や動物愛護団体からも、「ベルリン動物園はもっと早くにクヌートを処分する勇気を持つべきだった」と安楽死を支持する声が上がったと報じられた。

その後、アルブレヒトやグラフ＝ルドルフに対し、ドイツ国内外からの脅迫状が殺到したことなどもあり、ドイツやイギリス、オーストラリアなどのメディアの一部は、この論争の検証を行い、アルブレヒトの発言とされるものは実際には、前年でライプチヒ動物園で同様に母グマに遺棄されたナマケグマの仔が安楽死させられたことへの抗議についてのものであり、ライプチヒ動物園側が「人口哺育は人道的ではなく、動物の権利を侵害する」と主張していたのに反論し、「ライプチヒ動物園の理論に従えば、ベルリン動物園もクヌートを殺していなければならなかったことになる」と発言したものであったことや、グラフ＝ルドルフがクヌートに関する一切の発言を否定していることなどを明らかとし、謝罪している。<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1887892.htm ABC "Media Watch: Look Out, Knut...It's A Zoo Out There"]</ref><ref>[http://www.faz.net/s/RubCD175863466D41BB9A6A93D460B81174/Doc~E8B8FD4D0944D4EB68BA4874C4F423464~ATpl~Ecommon~Sspezial.html Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung "Der Eisbär und die Giftspritze"]</ref>

'''Knut''' () (born captivity at the Bild'' ran a quote from an activist that seemingly called for the death of the young cub, a worldwide public outrage was caused as fans rallied in support of his being hand-raised by humans.  Children protested outside the zoo, and many e-mails and letters expressing sympathy for the cub's life were sent from around the world.<ref name="reprieve"/>

Knut became the center of a mass media phenomenon dubbed "Knutmania" that spanned the globe and quickly spawned numerous toys, media specials, DVDs, and books.<ref name="cashcow"/>  Because of this, the cub was largely responsible for a significant increase in revenue, estimated at about five million euros, at the Berlin Zoo in 2007.<ref name="stamp"/>  Zoo attendance figures for the year increased by an estimated 30 percent making it the most profitable year in its 163-year history.<ref name="cult"></ref>

==Biography==
===Infancy===
thumb|Thomas Dörflein plays with Knut on [[31 May, 2007.]]
Knut was born at the Berlin Zoo to 20-year-old Tosca, a former circus performer from East Germany who was born in gestation time, Knut and his unnamed brother were born on incubator before zoo keeper Thomas Dörflein began raising the cub.<ref></ref>

Knut's need for around-the-clock care required that Dörflein not only sleep on a mattress next to Knut's sleeping crate at night, but also play with, bathe, and feed the cub daily. Knut's diet began with a bottle of baby formula mixed with cod liver oil every two hours, before graduating at the age of four months to a milk porridge mixed with cat food and vitamins.<ref name="dorflein"/><ref></ref> Dörflein also accompanied Knut on his twice-daily one-hour shows for the public and therefore appeared in many videos and photographs alongside the cub. As a result, Dörflein became a minor celebrity in Germany<ref name="dorflein"></ref> and was even awarded Berlin's Medal of Merit in honor of his continuous care for the polar bear cub.<ref name="medal"></ref>

===Controversy===
In early March 2007, German tabloid ''Bild-Zeitung'' carried a quote by animal rights activist Frank Albrecht who said that Knut should have been killed rather than humiliated by being raised "as a domestic pet". He declared that the zoo was violating animal protection legislation by keeping him alive.<ref></ref>  Wolfram Graf-Rudolf, the director of the Aachen Zoo, agreed with Albrecht and stated that the zookeepers "should have had the courage to let the bear die" after it was rejected, arguing that the bear will "die a little" every time it is separated from its caretaker.<ref name="berlinrallies"/>  A group of children protested at the zoo, holding up placards reading "Knut Must Live" and "We Love Knut", and others sent numerous emails and letters asking for the cub's life to be spared.  Threatening letters were also sent to Albrecht.<ref name="reprieve"></ref>  The Berlin Zoo rallied in support of the baby polar bear, vowing not to harm him.<ref name="berlinrallies"></ref>

Albrecht, who was not associated with any particular animal rights organization, later claimed that he was quoted out of context: According to Albrecht, he had filed suit against the head of the Leipzig Zoo in December 2006, for killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. The case was dismissed by the courts arguing that raising the animal by humans would have been inappropriate. Albrecht, who opposed that judgment, says he called for Knut's death not because he actually wanted to have the bear killed, but merely to call attention to the Leipzig decision, which would have granted the Berlin Zoo the right to kill the polar bear cub.<ref></ref> Most international media, however, relied on ''Bild-Zeitung'''s version and reported Albrecht's request to have Knut killed out of context. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

===In the spotlight===
On 23 March 2007, Knut was presented to the public for the first time.<ref name="knutday"></ref>  Around 400 journalists visited the Berlin Zoo on what was dubbed "Knut Day" to report on the cub's first public appearance to a worldwide audience.<ref name="mediaknut"></ref>  Because Knut became the focus of worldwide media at a very young age, many stories and false alarms regarding the cub's health and well-being were circulated during his first year.  For example, on 16 April 2007, Knut was removed from display due to teething pains resulting from the growth of his right upper canine tooth, but initial reports vaguely stated that he was suffering from an unknown illness and subsequently put on antibiotics.<ref></ref>  Much ado was also made about a death threat that was sent shortly before 15:00 local time on Wednesday 18 April 2007.  The zoo had received an anonymous letter by fax which said "Knut ist tot! Donnerstag Mittag." ("Knut is dead! Thursday noon.")<ref></ref> In response, the police increased their security measures around the bear. The time frame for the threat passed without incident or harm to Knut.<ref name="deaththreat"></ref><ref></ref>

thumb|200px|Five months after his debut, the 90&nbsp;kg cub is shown on [[31 October 2007.]]
Despite ''Der Spiegel'' reporting on 30 April 2007 that Knut was "steadily getting less cute" as he increased in age,<ref name="lesscute"></ref> Knut continued to bring in record crowds to the zoo that summer.  After reaching seven months old and 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lb) in July of 2007, Knut's scheduled twice daily public appearances were canceled due to the zoo's concern for the safety of his keeper.  Zoo spokeswoman Regine Damm also said it was time for the bear to "associate with other bears and not with other people."<ref></ref>  After living in the same enclosure as Ernst, a Malaysian black bear cub who was born a month before Knut, and its mother,<ref name="ernst"></ref> Knut was then moved to his own private living space.  While visitor numbers dwindled from extreme highs in March and April, Knut remained a major attraction at the zoo for the rest of 2007.  400,000 guests were recorded in August 2007, which was an all time high.<ref></ref>

News of Knut and his life at the zoo was still being reported internationally in late 2007.  Knut's restricted diet, necessary to curtail his natural weight gain necessary to survive harsh winters, made headlines outside of Germany.<ref></ref>  His daily meals were reduced in number from four to three, and treats, such as croissants, which are favored by the young polar bear, were restricted.<ref></ref>  After hurting his foot while slipping on a wet rock in his enclosure a month later in September, there was an outpouring of concern and support from fans worldwide.<ref></ref>

===Beyond 2007===
In November 2007 and weighing over 90&nbsp;kg (200&nbsp;lb), Knut was deemed too dangerous for close handling and his interaction with human handlers was further diminished.   The celebration of the cub's first birthday, which was attended by hundreds of children, was broadcast live on German television.  The national mint also issued 25,000 special commemorative silver coins to mark his birthday.<ref name="birthday"></ref>  

Although still considered a cub, a year after his public debut Knut weighed more than 130&nbsp;kg (300&nbsp;lb). A plate of six-inch glass, strong enough to resist a mortar blast, stands between him and zoo visitors.<ref></ref>  At the end of March 2008, Markus Röbke, one of the keepers who helped rear Knut, reported to ''Bild'' that the bear should leave the zoo as soon as possible in order to help him acclimate to a life alone.<ref name="pining"></ref>  Röbke also said that Knut plainly misses his past father-figure, Thomas Dörflein, and has become so used to attention that he cries when no one is near his enclosure.  "Knut needs an audience," Röbke stated.  "That has to change".<ref name="pining"/>  In April, animal welfare campaigners criticized the zoo for allowing Knut to kill and eat ten carp from the moat surrounding his enclosure, saying that it was a breach of German animal protection regulations.  The zoo's bear expert, Heiner Klös, however, said that Knut's behavior was "all part of being a polar bear."<ref></ref>

Knut's future role at the Berlin Zoo may include him becoming an "attractive stud" for other zoos in order to help preserve his species.<ref></ref>  Before he matures at the age of three or four, the common age for bears to become sexually active, Knut will likely be moved to another zoo with more mates closer to his age.
