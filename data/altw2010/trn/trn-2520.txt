'''סייד''' (חסן וחוסיין, בני ביתו פאטמה זהרה וחתנו עלי בן אבו טאלב, שהיה גם בן-דודו. לצאצאיות נקבות יש כינויים אחרים (סיידה וכיו"ב). במקרה שמוצאו של אדם ממוחמד מגיע דרך אמו אך לא דרך אביו, אין הוא זכאי לתואר '''סייד''', אם כי יש לו עדיין ייחוס.

מוסלמים מסוימים מעניקים כינוי זה גם לצאצאים של אבו טאלב, דודו של מוחמד, מבניו האחרים: ג'עפר, עקיל וטאלב.

אין לבלבל כינוי זה עם השם "סעיד", שהוא מילה ערבית ופרסית שמשמעותה "שמח". מילה אחרת שלפעמים מבלבלים בינה לבין תואר זה היא "שהיד", המונח הערבי למי שמת מות קדושים.

המילה '''סייד''' משמעותה המילולית "אדון", בדומה ללורד האנגלי. בעולם הערבי משמשת מילה זו עדיין לעתים כתחליף ל"אדון", כמו "סייד ג'ון סמית'". הרעיון מובע גם באמצעות המילה "סידי" בניבים מערביים של השפה הערבית.

השיעים מבדילים בין סיידים לאלו שאינם על פי צבע מצנפתם: הסיידים עוטים מצנפות שחורות או ירוקות (צבע בית עלי), ואילו אלו שאינם סיידים לובשים מצנפות לבנות או בצבע בהיר אחר.

הנהגת השיעים לאורך הדורות הורכבה במרביתה המכרעת מסיידים; בין המנהיגים השיעים בני זמננו שהם סיידים: מזכ"ל המנהיג העליון האיראני עלי ח'מנאי (גם קודמו, רוחאללה ח'ומייני היה סייד).

==כינויים אחרים==
כינויי כבוד ערביים אחרים כוללים את התארים "שייח'" ו"שָריף". שושלת ה"סיידים" מבית חסן ששלטו במכה, אל-מדינה, עיראק וכעת שולטים בירדן, בית האשם, נשאו את התואר "שָריף". בעולם הערבי "שָריף" לרוב שמור עבור צאצאי חסן בעוד "סייד" מצוי בשימוש עבור צאצאי חוסיין.

כינוי נוסף, המצוי בשימוש בעיקר בדרום ובדרום מזרח אסיה, הוא "מיר" או מירזא.

'''Sayyid''' ('''''') (plural Saadah) is an honorific title that is given to  males accepted as descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad through his grandsons, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali, who were the sons of his daughter Fatima Zahra and son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib. 

Daughters of male sayyids are given the titles Sayyida, Alawiyah, Syarifah or Sharifah. Children of a Sayyida mother but a non-Sayyid father cannot be attributed the title of Sayyid, however they may claim maternal descent. Both Shiites and Sunnis that claim descent from Muhammad, do so through at least one of the Shiite Imams.

In Islamic mysticism or Sufism, only a sayyid can initiate a Sufi order or tariqah.   

==Other Uses==
The word literally means "master" ; the closest English equivalent would be "Moroccan dialect of Arabic. 
 
Some Muslims also use the term ''sayyid'' for the descendants of Abu Talib, uncle of Muhammad), by his other sons: Jafar, Abbas, Aqeel and Talib.

Alevis use seyyid (Turkish) as an honorific before the names of their saints.

Dawoodi Bohras use the title ''syyedina'' for their ''Da'i al-Mutlaq'' (spiritual leader of the Bohra community) although they are not the descendants of Fatima.

El Cid , the name given to a famous Spanish knight of the 11th century C.E., is derived from Al-Sayyid (''as-sayyid''), meaning lord.

People chose different Romanised (Latinized) transliterations based on the language with which they are familiar, not necessarily on the place where they are living. For example there are Muslim immigrants from many different countries living in  London, UK. Immigrants of Arab origin may use the transliteration "sayyid" whilst immigrants of South Asian origin may use "Syed", this tendency may be extended to all ethnic communities.

Other Arabic honorific terms include sheikh and sharif. The line of Hassani sayyids who ruled Mecca, Medina, Iraq and now rule in Jordan, the Hashemites, bore the title 'sharif' (plu. Ashraf). 'Sharif' is reserved for descendants of Hassan while 'sayyid' is used for descendants of Husayn.  However ever since the post-Hashemite era began, the term 'sayyid' has been used to denote descendants from both Hassan and Husayn. Arab Shiites use the term 'sayyid' and 'habib' to denote descendants from both Hassan and Husayn.

==Indication of descent==
Sayyids often include the following titles in their names to indicate the figure from whom they trace their descent. If they are descended from more than one notable ancestor or Shi'a Imam, they will use the title of the ancestor from whom they are most directly descended.

NOTE: (For non-Arabic speakers) When transliterating Arabic words into English there are two approaches.  
*1. The user may transliterate the word letter for letter, e.g.  "الزيدي" becomes "a-l-z-ai-d-i".  

*2. The user transliterate the pronunciation of the word, e.g.  "الزيدي" becomes "a-zz-ai-d-i".  This is because in Arabic grammar, some consonants (''n, r, s, sh, t'' and ''z'') cancel the ''l'' (ل) from the word "the" ''al'' (ال) .  When the user sees the prefixes ''an'', ''ar'', ''as'', ''ash'', ''at'', ''az'', etc... this means the word is the transliteration of the pronunciation.  

*An ''i'', ''wi'' (Arabic), or ''vi'' (Persian) ending could perhaps be translated by the English suffixes ''ite'' or ''ian''.  The suffix transforms a personal name, or a place name, into the name of a group of people connected by lineage or place of birth. Hence ''Ahmad al-Hashimi'' could be translated as ''Ahmad of the lineage of Hassan'' and ''Ahmad al-Harrani'' as ''Ahmad from the city of Harran''. For further explanation, see Arabic names.

<sup>1</sup>Also, El-Husseini, Al-Husseini, Husseini, and Hussaini.

<sup>2</sup>Those who use the term ''sayyid'' for all descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib regard Allawis or Alavis as sayyids.  However Allawis are not descendants of Muhammad, as they are descended from the children of Ali and the women he married after the death of Fatima Zahra, such as Umm al Baneen/Fatima bint Hizam. Those who limit the term ''sayyid'' to descendants of Muhammad through Fatima Zahra, will not consider Allawis/Alavis to be sayyids.

<sup>3</sup>This transliteration is usually reserved for Alawi sect.

==False Claims==
False claimant to Sayyid status are called mutasayyid or müteseyyid[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/muwo/2006/00000096/00000001/art00002 See Sayyids and Sharīfs in the Ottoman State: On the Borders of the True and the False]

==Ibn Battutah on the usage of 'Sayyid' in India ==
Ibn Battutah had the following to say on the usage of ''sayyid'' in India: 

''Sayyid'' was also used as a term of respect by some Indian Muslims. Therefore, someone with the name ''sayyid'' in the Indian subcontinent is not necessarily of ''sayyid'' extraction. ''Sayyid'' families originate from particular villages or towns. If the person called ''sayyid'' can prove his family originated from an authentic ''sayyid'' town, that establishes his pedigree. In the modern era, ''sayyid'' is used only by descendants of the Prophet, and the title is no longer applied to non-''sayyid''s as a mark of respect.

==Sayyids in Indian Sub-continent==

Some Sayyid families in Indian sub-continent claim direct relationship with the Prophet of Islam through his daughter Fâtimah and son-in-law Ali. Their ancestors migrated from different parts of Iran, during the invasion of Halaku and other periods of turmoil. They migrated through Herat (then part of Iran) in Afghanistan to different parts of India. These migrations occurred during the periods of Mahmud Ghaznavi, Delhi Sultanate and Mughals and continued till late into 19th century. Most sufi saints whose lineage could also be traced to Prophet Muhammad also migrated during the early periods of Delhi Sultanat and Mughals. Some of the early migrant Sayyids moved deep to the peninsular part of India, in the region of Deccan plateau in the reign of Bahmani Sultanate/Bahmani kings and later Qutb Shahi kings of Golconda, Nizam Shahi of Ahmadnagar, and other kingdoms of Bijapur, Bidar and Berar.

''Sherazi/Shirazi''
Jaffery sadat family in Sargodha descendant of Shah Shams Sherazi who was the descendant of Shitte Imam Jafar as-Sadiq. He was the son of Sher Ali, whose mausoleum is in Delhi. Sher Ali had come to India with the Mughal Emperor Humayun. In fact, Humayun moved to Iran seeking help to regain his empire when he was overthrown by Farid Khan, popularly known as Sher Shah Suri. After a special prayer for his success, Sher Ali and his two sons, Shah Shams and Jalal Shah, were asked to accompany Humayun to Delhi. On their way, they were informed that Sher Shah Suri died. Without any bloodshed in the battleground, Humayun took over and regained the power. He gifted a piece of land to Sher Ali and offered his son, Shah Shams, the marriage proposal of a girl from the Mughal family. Shah Shams accepted the proposal. In later years, the couple was blessed with five sons. Shah Shams and his family left Delhi and crossed the Jhelum River to settle in Rampur (presently known as Shahpur (Punjab) currently in Sargodha District. While his brother Jalal Shah moved to a deserted area in Afghanistan and lived there. Jalalabad, now a city in Afghanistan, was named after him.
