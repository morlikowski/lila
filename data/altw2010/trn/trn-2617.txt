'''''Winnie Winkle''''' was one of the longest running American comic strips, appearing over a 76-year span from 1920 to 1996. Created by Martin Branner, it was one of the first influential comic strips about working women.

==History==
The comic strip ''Winnie Winkle'' was created in 1920 for the Chicago Tribune Syndicate and debuted on September 20, 1920. It was called ''Winnie Winkle the Breadwinner'' until 1943 
<ref></ref>. The idea for the comic was conceived by Joseph Medill Patterson,<ref></ref> but the stories and artwork were all done by Martin Branner, who had made two unsuccessful comic strips earlier. Winnie Winkle was a young, unmarried  woman who had to support her parents and (from 1922 on) her adopted brother Perry, making ''Winnie Winkle'' the first popular comic strip about working women.<ref></ref> It was a reflection of the new role of women in society, as could also be seen in comics like ''Tillie the Toiler'' from 1921.<ref></ref> <ref></ref>

During its first years, the daily ''Winnie Winkle'' comic strip evolved from a gagstrip into a soap opera. An addition to the family was Perry, whom the Winkles adopted in 1922. A child from the backstreets, Perry was forced into fashionable clothes and coat but this did not stop him from hanging out with his gang, the Rinkydinks, much to the disapproval of Winnie who regarded them as "loafers".

Major issues were the marriage of Winnie with engineer Will Wright in 1937, and the disappearance of Will during World War II, leaving a pregnant Winnie behind. Even this realistic and unfortunate situation was still too risque for some newspapers: ''The Baltimore Sun'' dropped ''Winnie Winkle'' early in 1941 because of her pregnancy.<ref></ref> After the war, she worked in the fashion industry, seemingly as a widow, until her husband returned after a few decades. She took on various other jobs and endeavours over the years, including a stint in the Peace Corps.<ref></ref>

==Artists==
Branner used a number of assistants on the comics, including between 1934 and 1946 the young French author Robert Velter, who would return to Europe to create the famous series ''Spirou et Fantasio'',<ref></ref> and from 1941 until 1958 John A. Berrill, who later created ''Gil Thorp''.<ref></ref> After Branner suffered a stroke in 1962, his assistant Max Van Bibber continued the series until 1980, later followed by  students from the Joe Kubert school of cartooning and finally by veteran artist Frank Bolle.<ref></ref><ref></ref> It finally ended on July 28, 1996 after 76 years, one of the longest runs in the history of American comic strips.
