Chiếc '''1930. Nó là một trong những máy bay tiêm kích hiện đại thực sự đầu tiên vào thời đó, có những tính năng như cấu trúc 1939 đến 1945) là 30.573 chiếc. Loại máy bay tiêm kích chiếm 47% số lượng máy bay do Đức sản xuất, và chiếc Bf 109 chiếm đến 57% số máy bay tiêm kích được sản xuất.<ref name="The Fighting Me 109"> Feist 1993, p. 45.</ref> Ngoài ra, 2.193 chiếc Bf 109 phiên bản A-E đã được chế tạo trước chiến tranh từ năm 1936 đến 1939, và có hơn 1.000 chiếc được chế tạo sau chiến tranh theo Avia S-99/S-199 và Ha 1112 Buchon.

Chiếc Bf 109 là xương sống của lực lượng tiêm kích ''1941. Chiếc Bf 109 đã ghi được số chiến công không chiến nhiều hơn cả trong Thế Chiến II hơn mọi kiểu máy bay tiêm kích nào khác. Trong những thời đđiểm khác nhau, nó được sử dụng như là máy bay tiêm kích hộ tống ném bom, tiêm kích đánh chặn, tấn công mặt đất và máy bay trinh sát. Cho dù Bf 109 có những điểm yếu, bao gồm tầm bay kém và đặc biệt là khó điều khiển hạ cánh do vệt bánh hẹp của kiểu càng đáp gấp ra phía ngoài, nó vẫn tỏ ra cạnh tranh cùng những máy bay tiêm kích Đồng Minh cho đến khi chiến tranh kết thúc.

Chiếc Bf 109 được lái bởi ba phi công "Ách" có thành tích dẫn đầu trong Thế Chiến II: Mặt trận phía Đông. Hartmann đã từ chối bay chiến đấu với bất kỳ kiểu máy bay nào khác trong suốt cuộc chiến. Hans-Joachim Marseille, phi công "Ách" Đức có thành tích cao nhất tại Mặt trận Bắc Phi, cũng ghi được toàn bộ 158 chiến công chính thức của mình trên kiểu Bf 109 khi đối đầu cùng những phi công Đồng Minh Tây Âu. Chiếc Bf 109 cũng được sử dụng với kết quả tốt bởi phi công các nước khác, bao gồm phi công "Ách" Phần Lan Ilmari Juutilainen với 94 chiến công, thành tích cao nhất của một phi công "Ách" không phải là người Đức trong lịch sử.

===Tên gọi của kiểu Bf 109===
'''Bf 109''' là tên gọi chính thức mà ''1938 khi 1938, và trong số nhân viên của Không quân Đức vốn phát âm chúng là ''may hundert-neun''. Tên gọi '''Me 109''' cũng thông dụng trong các nước nói tiếng Anh. Tuy nhiên, trong cả thời kỳ chiến tranh cho đến hiện nay, cả hai tên "Bf" và "Me" đều được dùng; còn trên biển khung máy bay của những chiếc còn giữ lại cho đến ngày nay đều mang tên "Bf 109", kể cả phiên bản cuối cùng K-14.

===Lịch sử cạnh tranh===
Vào năm 1933, cơ quan ''Technisches Amt'' (hay T-Amt, bộ phận kỹ thuật của Bộ Hàng không Đức) đã kết luận về một loạt các đề án nghiên cứu về không chiến trong tương lai. Kết quả của các nghiên cứu này là bốn dự thảo chung cho máy bay chiến đấu trong tương lai:
*''Rüstungsflugzeug (máy bay vũ trang) I'' về một kiểu máy bay ném bom hạng trung nhiều động cơ.
*''Rüstungsflugzeug II'' về một kiểu máy bay ném bom chiến thuật.
*''Rüstungsflugzeug III'' về một kiểu máy bay tiêm kích hạng nặng hai chỗ ngồi.
*''Rüstungsflugzeug IV'' về một kiểu máy bay tiêm kích một chỗ ngồi

''Rüstungsflugzeug IV'' được dự định là một kiểu máy bay tiêm kích đánh chặn thay thế cho những kiểu máy bay cánh kép Arado Ar 64 và Heinkel He 60 đang phục vụ. Trong khi R-IV  được dự trù như là kiểu máy bay tiêm kích tốt nhất trong số những máy bay đang hoạt động, các yêu cầu đặt ra lại không quá khó để có thể đạt được.

Chiếc máy bay tiêm kích cần đạt được tốc độ tối đa 400 km/h (250 dặm mỗi giờ) ở độ cao 6.000 m (19.500 ft) và có thể duy trì được như vậy trong vòng 20 phút, trong khi tổng thời gian ở trên không cần thiết là 90 phút. Nó sẽ được trang bị kiểu động cơ mới Junkers Jumo 210 có công suất tối đa khoảng 700 mã lực (522 kW). Nó cũng cần phải được trang bị ít nhất ba súng máy 7,9 mm với 1.000 viên đạn cho mỗi khẩu, hoặc một pháo 20 mm với 200 quả đạn. Một đặc tínhkhá thú vị khác là yêu cầu áp lực cánh của chiếc máy bay phải dưới 100 kg/m², một cách để khẳng định khả năng lộn vòng và lên cao của chiếc máy bay. Ưu tiên thiết kế của chiếc máy bay tiêm kích là tốc độ bay ngang, tốc độ lên cao và khả năng cơ động (theo thứ tự trên).

Thực ra bản tính năng của đề án R-IV không do nội bộ của T-Amt nghĩ ra. Vào đầu năm 1933 cả Arado đã gửi đến những thiết kế do đầu tư riêng của các hãng này cho một kiểu máy bay tiêm kích cánh đơn, và T-Amt chỉ đơn giản thu nhặt những đặc tính tốt nhất từ cả hai thiết kế này rồi gửi trở lại cho họ, bổ sung thêm hãng 1934 bản dự thảo yêu cầu R-IV được chính thức phát hành. Mỗi nhà thầu được yêu cầu chế tạo ba chiếc nguyên mẫu để được thử nghiệm cạnh tranh trực tiếp vào cuối năm 1934.

Ban đầu 1935, cho dù Milch đã hé lộ cho biết rằng họ sẽ không bao giờ thắng được hợp đồng.

===Các đặc tính thiết kế===
right|thumb|Chiếc Messerschmitt Bf 109G-10 trưng bày tại [[Bảo tàng Quốc gia Không quân Hoa Kỳ ở Dayton, Ohio.]]
Cho đến lúc này Messerschmitt đã thiết kế được khá nhiều thành phần của chiếc Bf 109. Giống như chiếc Bf 108, kiểu thiết kế mới dựa trên nguyên tắc "cấu trúc nhẹ cân" của Messerschmitt, vốn nhắm vào việc giảm thiểu tổng số các "điểm cứng" của khung máy bay càng ít càng tốt. Một ví dụ đáng chú ý của nguyên tắc này là gắn tất cả các điểm cấu trúc lên một thành cứng phía trước buồng lái, bao gồm gốc cánh, điểm treo động cơ và bộ càng đáp. Trong cách thiết kế mang tính truyền thống hơn, chúng sẽ được gắn trên các điểm khác nhau của máy bay, và một khung sẽ phân phối lực tải giữa chúng.

Một ưu thế khác đáng chú ý của thiết kế này là, do bộ càng đáp được gắn trực tiếp lên thân máy bay, người ta có thể tháo rời toàn bộ cánh để bảo trì sửa chữa nếu cần, để lại thân máy bay không bị đụng chạm trên càng đáp. Tuy nhiên, điều này cũng có một khiếm khuyết lớn: cách bố trí bộ càng đáp vào thân khiến cho chúng có vệt bánh (khoảng cách giữa hai bánh đáp chính) khá hẹp và làm cho máy bay kém thăng bằng khi ở trên mặt đất. Chiếc Bf 109 vốn nổi tiếng là khó cất cánh và hạ cánh, và nhiều chiếc máy bay tiêm kích đang trông như hoàn hảo đơn giản đã bị lạc hướng hay lật ngược. Sự việc càng làm cho kém hơn khi bộ càng đáp khá dài, khiến cho mũi máy bay hướng lên trên một góc khá so với mặt đất khiến cho tầm nhìn ra phía trước khi lăn bánh trên mặt đất gần như bằng không.

Chiếc Bf 109 chịu ảnh hưởng bởi các tai nạn trên mặt đất do "quay ngoặc" khi cất cánh và hạ cánh trong suốt vòng đời của chúng. Người ta đã ước lượng có khoảng 5% những chiếc 109 bị mất do cách này, thậm chí con số có thể lên đến một phần ba; tuy nhiên, con số được ghi nhận chính thức của Không quân Đức về các tại nạn chỉ có khoảng 1% trong tổng số Bf 109 bị thiệt hại do tai nạn khi hạ cánh hay tai nạn trong thời gian hoạt động ban đầu, một con số tương đương với những máy bay tiêm kích cánh đơn khác được đưa ra hoạt động vào thời đó. Dù vậy, tính chất này chỉ là một vấn đề đối với những phi công mới, đặc biệt là trong giai đoạn cuối của cuộc chiến.<ref name="hannu" /> Chiếc Spitfire cũng có cùng kiểu càng đáp hạ cánh hẹp, nhưng đã không có những loan truyền rộng rãi về những thiệt hại trong hoạt động do kiểu cấu hình này, và người ta đã suy đoán rằng hiện tượng quay ngoặc này là do cặp bánh đáp chính bị chụm lại. Đa số các phi công Phần Lan báo cáo rằng đa số hiện tượng quay ngoặc rất dễ kiểm soát, nhưng những phi công thiếu kinh nghiệm thường dễ đánh mất chiếc máy bay của mình lúc khởi đầu.<ref name="hannu" />

Phản ảnh niềm tin của Willy Messerschmitt về kiểu máy bay cánh đơn nhẹ cân lực cản thấp, vũ khí trang bị được bố trí trên thân chính của máy bay, bao gồm hai súng máy gắn bên trên động cơ và một khẩu thứ ba bắn qua trục cánh quạt dùng động cơ để chống giật. Cách bố trí này giúp cho có được kiểu cánh không mang súng mỏng và nhẹ. Khi khám phá ra rằng Không quân Hoàng gia Anh đã sản xuất những chiếc máy bay tiêm kích trang bị tám súng máy, rõ ràng là chiếc Bf 109 phải được mang theo nhiều vũ khí, nên một kiểu cánh mới được thiết kế với các khẩu súng mới, và sau này là các khẩu pháo 20 mm bắn hướng ra phía trước.

Vào năm 1938 chiếc "Emil" được đưa vào sản xuất, nhưng để cải thiện tính năng bay vốn được cung cấp bởi kiểu động cơ Jumo tương đối nhỏ công suất chỉ đạt từ 600 đến 700 mã lực, kiểu động cơ lớn hơn Daimler Benz DB 601A được sử dụng, cung cấp thêm 300 mã lực với cái giá phải nặng hơn 181,4 kg (400 lb).

Một khía cạnh khác của kỹ thuật cấu trúc này là việc sử dụng một khung cánh duy nhất có tiết diện hình chữ I, được bố trí gần mép trước cánh, tạo nên một hộp chịu lực chắc chắn hình chữ D. Đa số các máy bay vào thời đó dùng hai khung gần mép trước và mép sau, nhưng hộp hình D này chịu lực xoắn tốt hơn, nên loại bỏ bớt được khung phía sau.

Một khác biệt chủ yếu là áp lực cánh lớn hơn rất nhiều so với các thiết kế khác. Trong khi hợp đồng thiết kế R-IV yêu cầu một áp lực cánh nhỏ hơn 100 kg/m², Messerschmitt cho rằng điều này không thỏa đáng. Vì với những động cơ hiện có cho chúng, chiếc máy bay tiêm kích sẽ bay chậm hơn những chiếc máy bay ném bom mà chúng cần đuổi bắt kịp.

Cánh làm phát sinh ra hai loại lực cản, loại lực cản ký sinh do hình dạng của cánh, trong khi lực cản phát sinh là hệ quả của lực nâng. Loại thứ nhất chiếm ưu thế ở tốc độ cao, khi mà dòng chảy không khí chạm phải cánh gây ra lực cản theo tỉ lệ bình phương với vận tốc máy bay. Loại thứ hai chiếm ưu thế ở tốc độ thấp, khi việc thiếu hụt dòng chảy không khí buộc cánh phải hướng vào dòng không khí ở một góc tấn lớn. Vì chiếc máy bay tiêm kích được thiết kế chủ yếu để hoạt động ở tốc độ cao, một kiểu cánh nhỏ hơn sẽ tối ưu hóa cho việc sử dụng ở tốc độ cao.

Mặt yếu của thiết kế này là tính năng bay ở tốc độ thấp sẽ bị ảnh hưởng, vì kiểu cánh nhỏ hơn đòi hỏi dòng không khí lớn hơn tạo ra đủ lực nâng để có thể tiếp tục bay được. Để khắc phục vấn đề này, chiếc Bf 109 bao gồm các thiết bị tăng cường lực nâng tiên tiến trên cánh, bao gồm các cánh mép tự động giương ra ở mép trước cánh, và cáccánh nắp lồi khá lớn ở mép sau cánh. Nó cũng bao gồm các cánh tà sẽ giương ra khi các cánh nắp hạ xuống, nhờ đó gia tăng diện tích cánh nắp hiệu quả một khi chúng được giương ra. Khi được dùng, các thiết bị này giúp gia tăng có hiệu quả hệ số lực nâng, làm cho chúng có tính năng bay tốt hơn ở tốc độ thấp và góc tấn lớn. 

Một khuyết điểm khác của áp lực cánh lớn là chiếc máy bay tiêm kích sẽ đòi hỏi nhiều động lực hơn để cơ động. Với công suất các kiểu động cơ đang sẵn có bị giới hạn, điều đó có nghĩa là chiếc Bf 109 không thể lượn vòng hẹp như những thiết kế khác có cánh lớn hơn. Các thiết bị tăng cường lực nâng có thể bù đắp phần nào vấn đề này, nhưng chúng cũng làm tăng lực cản và làm chiếc máy bay chậm hơn tương ứng. Cho rằng độ cơ động là ưu tiên cuối cùng trong các tính năng mà RLM mong muốn, Messerschmitt đã tin tưởng rằng các lợi điểm mang lại đáng kể hơn là các khiếm khuyết phải có.

The Bf 109 was the backbone of the ''bomber escort, an interceptor, a ground-attack aircraft, and a reconnaissance aircraft. Although the Bf 109 had weaknesses, including a short range, and especially a sometimes difficult to handle narrow, outward-retracting undercarriage, it stayed competitive with Allied fighter aircraft until the end of the war.

The Bf 109 was flown by the three top-scoring fighter aces of World War II: Eastern Front. Hartmann refused to fly any other aircraft in combat throughout the war. Western Allied pilots. The Bf 109 was also used with good results by non-German pilots, such as the Finnish fighter ace Ilmari Juutilainen with 94 victories &mdash; the highest scoring non-German fighter ace in history<ref>http://www.acesofww2.com/finland/aces/Juutilainen.htm Ilmari Juutilainen</ref><ref>The Japanese ace Hiroyoshi Nishizawa is officially credited with 87 kills, although some sources claim between 120-150.

==Designation==

'''Bf 109''' was the official ''Reichsluftfahrtministerium'' (German Aviation Ministry, RLM) designation, since the design was submitted by the ''Bayerische Flugzeugwerke'' company, and was used exclusively in all official German documents dealing with this aircraft family. The company was renamed Messerschmitt AG after July 1938<ref>[http://www.pilotfriend.com/acft_manu/Messerschmitt%20Bayerische%20Flugzeugwerke.htm, Brief history of MBB] Retrieved: 23 February 2008.</ref> when Erhard Milch finally allowed Willy Messerschmitt to acquire the company; from that date forward, all Messerschmitt aircraft were to carry the  "Me" designation except those already assigned a Bf prefix. Wartime documents from Messerschmitt AG, RLM, and others continued to use both designations<ref>[http://109lair.hobbyvista.com/index1024.htm  Messerschmitt AG documents] Retrieved: 23 February 2008.</ref>, sometimes even on the same page but there were several RLM orders to deny acceptance of documents carrying the Me prefix for the Bf 109. '''Me 109'''  is known to have been the name used in print by ''Luftwaffe'' propaganda publications as well as by the Messerschmitt company itself after July 1938, and ''Luftwaffe'' personnel, who pronounced it ''may hundert-neun''. The '''Me 109''' ("emm ee one-oh-nine") designation was usually used in the English-speaking world. However, in both wartime and contemporary literature, both the "Bf" and "Me" as well as "ME" prefixes are used.<ref>[http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/me109/me109g.html Me 109 G Flight test reports] Retrieved: 23 February 2008.</ref> All extant airframes are described as "Bf 109" on  identification plates, including the final K-4 models.<ref>Prien and Rodeike 1995, pp. 167–176.</ref>

==Contest history==
During 1933 the ''Technisches Amt'' (the technical department, or T-Amt, of RLM) concluded a series of research projects into the future of air combat. The result of the studies was four broad outlines for future aircraft:
*''Rüstungsflugzeug I'' for a multi-place medium bomber
*''Rüstungsflugzeug II'' for a tactical bomber
*''Rüstungsflugzeug III'' for a two-seat heavy fighter
*''Rüstungsflugzeug IV'' for a single-seat fighter
thumb|right|150px|Bf 109 in flight
''Rüstungsflugzeug IV'' was intended to be an interceptor, replacing the Arado Ar 64 and Heinkel He 60 biplanes then in service. While it was intended the R-IV aircraft would best all others then flying, the requirements were nevertheless not terribly hard to meet.

The fighter needed to have a top speed of 400 km/h at 6,000 m (250 mph at 19,500 ft) which it could maintain for 20 minutes, while staying in the air for a total of 90 minutes. It was to be powered by the new Junkers Jumo 210 engine of about 700 hp (522 kW). It also needed to be armed with at least three 7.9 mm machine guns with 1,000 rounds each, or one 20 mm cannon with 200 rounds. One other interesting specification was that the aircraft needed to keep wing loading below 100 kg/m², which is a way of defining the aircraft's ability to turn and climb. The priorities for the fighter design were level speed, climb speed, and maneuverability, in that order.

In fact the R-IV specifications were not actually devised by the T-Amt at all. In early 1933 both Arado had sent in privately-funded designs for a monoplane fighter, and the T-Amt simply collected the best features from both and sent them back out again, adding Focke-Wulf to the tender. In May 1934 the R-IV request was distributed to the tenderers and made official. Each was asked to deliver three prototypes to be delivered for head-to-head testing in late 1934.

Willy Messerschmitt was originally not invited to participate in the competition. This was mainly due to personal animosity between Messerschmitt and RLM director Erhard Milch (Hans Hackman, a close friend of Milch, was killed testing the prototype Messerschmitt M20 light transport aircraft), after the M20 proved a disaster in ''Lufthansa'' use. Nevertheless, Messerschmitt was on very good terms with many high ranking ''Luftwaffe'' officers based on the success of the Messerschmitt Bf 108 ''Taifun'' sports plane. After a delay of several months, Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (Bavarian Aircraft Manufacturers, or BFW) for which Messerschmitt was head designer, was invited to take part in early 1935, although Milch let it be known they would never win the contract.

===Prototypes===
thumb|Messerschmitt Bf 109 V1
The first prototype (''Versuchsflugzeug 1'' or ''V1''), with the civilian registration '''D-IABI''', was completed by May 1935, but the German engines were not yet ready. In order to get the designs into the air, the RLM acquired four Rechlin to take part in the design contest.

By the late summer, the Jumo engines were starting to become available, and '''V2''' was completed with the 602 hp (449 kW) Jumo 210A in October 1935. '''V3''' followed, being the first to actually mount guns, but another Jumo 210 was not available and it ended up delaying the flight of '''V3''' until May 1936. Like V1, V2 and V3 were sent to Rechlin after acceptance tests at the factory.

The flight data of these three aircraft were very nearly identical. The maximum airspeed was about 470 km/h at 4,000 m altitude, and the service ceiling was about 8,300 m.

===The contest===
After Luftwaffe acceptance trials were completed at Rechlin, the prototypes were moved to Travemünde for the head-to-head portion of the contest. The Heinkel design arrived first, in early February 1936, and the rest of the V1s had all arrived by the beginning of March.

Because most of the fighter pilots of the Luftwaffe were used to good-natured biplanes with open cockpits, light g-forces and easy handling, they were very critical about the Bf 109 at first. However it was soon a front-runner in the contest, as the Arado and Focke-Wulf entries proved to be hopelessly outdated. Perhaps this was not surprising, considering those entries had actually been designed two years earlier, and given the rate of change in aircraft design at the time, they really had little chance against the much more modern Bf 109.

The only serious competition to the Bf 109 was the Heinkel entry. Based on a scaled down ''Blitz'', the He 112 proved to be similar but different. Positive aspects of the He 112 included the wide track and robustness of the landing gear, considerably better visibility from the cockpit, and a lower wing loading that led to easier landings and better maneuverability. By contrast, the Bf 109 was 30 km/h faster than the He 112 in level flight, and superior in climbing and diving. It was also cheaper.<ref>Caidin, Martin. ''Me-109''. Ballantine.</ref> Still, the He 112 was the favourite of the ''Luftwaffe'' leaders.

Orders for a further ten examples of both types were placed, and they started trickling in over the next few months. However by this point the Jumo-powered examples of both designs had arrived for testing, and the Bf 109's better streamlining and lower drag meant that it was considerably faster given the lower-power engine.

Even before the pre-production models arrived the contest was basically over. In March the RLM received news that the Spitfire had been ordered into production; with this information a quick result to the contest was needed in order to get the winning design into production. On 12 March, they released a document that outlined the results of the contest, ''Bf 109 Priority Procurement''. Nothing occurred over the summer to change their minds, and the RLM instructed Heinkel to re-design the He 112 radically, while ordering the Bf 109 into production.<ref>Fesit 1993, p. 14.</ref>

==Design features==
right|thumb|Messerschmitt Bf 109G-10 at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio]]

As with the earlier Bf 108, the new design was based on Messerschmitt's "lightweight construction", which essentially aimed at reducing the total number of parts in the aircraft as much as possible. One of the more notable examples of this were the two large, complicated brackets which were fitted to the main engine firewall; these brackets incorporated the lower engine mounts and landing gear pivot points. Another large forging which was attached to the firewall carried the main-spar pick up points, which carried most of the wing loads. Contemporary design practice was usually to have these main load-bearing structures mounted on different parts on the airframe, with the loads being distributed through the main structure via a series of strong-points. By centralising the loads on the main bulkhead the main structure of the 109 was able to be made relatively light and uncomplicated.<ref>Cross and Scarborough 1976, pp. 56–66.</ref>

Another notable advantage of this design was that, since the landing gear was attached to the fuselage itself, it was possible to completely remove the wings of the aircraft for major servicing, if necessary, leaving the fuselage intact sitting on the landing gear. It also meant that the wing structure was able to be simplified through not having to carry the weight of the aircraft and not having to bear the loads imposed during take-off or landing. However, this had one major drawback &mdash; this landing gear arrangement ensured a narrow track and hence made the aircraft unstable in terms of balance while on the ground. In an attempt to increase the wheel track the legs were splayed out; this created another problem in that loads imposed during take-off and landings were transferred at an angle up the legs. The small rudder of the 109 was relatively ineffective at controlling the strong swing created by the powerful slipstream of the propeller and this sideways drift created disproportionate loads on the wheel opposite the swing. If the forces imposed were large enough the pivot points often broke and the landing gear leg would be forced sideways into its bay. The Spitfire had a similar, narrow landing gear arrangement, but because there were no sideways loads imposed on the undercarriage legs the undercarriage didn't have the same tendency to collapse.<ref>Cross and Scarborough 1976, pp. 60–61.</ref> 

Because of the large ground angle caused by the long legs visibility for the pilot, especially straight ahead, was very poor, a problem exacerbated by the sideways opening canopy. This meant that the pilots often had to "snake" the aircraft during taxiing manoeuvres, which again imposed stresses on the splayed undercarriage legs. 

Although there have been suggested that from five to 33% of all 109s were damaged or destroyed in this way, the Luftwaffe's loss records show that approximately 1% of the Bf 109s had suffered landing incidents or accidents at the beginning of its career, a figure comparable to the other monoplane fighters introduced at the time. Ground accidents were, however, more of a problem with rookie pilots, especially during the later stages of the war.<ref name="hannu" /> Even experienced pilots, especially those who were tired, were caught out. Most Finnish pilots report that the swing was easy to control, but some of the less experienced pilots lost fighters on startup.<ref name="hannu" /> As more powerful engines and larger propeller blades were used the swing became more pronounced, although the provision of a fixed "tall" tailwheel on some of the late G-10s and 14s and the K series helped alleviate the problem to a large extent.

Right from the inception of the design priority was given to total and easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operational from forward airfields. To this end the entire engine cowling was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle-latches. A Large panel under the wing centre-section could be removed to gain access to the L-shaped main fuel tank, which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling systems and electrical equipment. The engine was held in two large, forged, magnesium alloy y-shaped legs which were cantilevered from the main firewall/bulkhead. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release screw fittings on the main firewall. All of the main pipe connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and the electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes.<ref>Cross and Scarborough 1976, pp. 61–62.</ref><ref>[http://www.clubhyper.com/reference/bf109detailbg_1.htm 109G cowling panels and main bulkhead] Retrieved: 7 April 2008.</ref>

Reflecting Messerschmitt's belief in low-weight, low-drag, simple monoplanes, the armament was placed in the fuselage; two machine guns were mounted in the cowl, while a third could be fired through the airscrew hub,<ref>Cross and Scarborough  1976, p. 74. Note: British reports on captured DB 601 series engines describe "A double walled cannon tube housing" as part of the crankcase&mdash. Few Bf 109s used weapons firing through the propeller hub until the Bf 109 F series which used 15 and 20mm weapons. Len Deighton's assertions that 109Es equipped with hub firing cannon flew during the Battle of Britain are totally wrong.</ref> with the engine buffering the recoil. Fitting with Dr Messerschmitt's ethos, this kept his gun-free wings very thin and lightweight. When it was discovered the RAF was producing eight-gun monoplanes, it became clear the Bf 109 would need to carry more weaponry; a new wing was designed to carry machine guns, and later, 20 mm MG FF cannon configurations.

In 1938 the "Emil" entered production. To improve on the performance allowed by the rather small 600 to 700 hp Jumo, the larger Daimler Benz DB 601A engine was used, yielding an extra 300 hp at the cost of an additional 400 lb.

Another aspect of this construction technique was the use of a single, I-section main spar in the wing, mounted closer to the leading edge, forming a stiff D-shaped torsion box with it. Most aircraft of the era used two spars, near the front and rear, but the D-box was much stiffer torsionally, and eliminated the need for the rear spar. The wing profile was somewhere between NACA 2314 and 2315, with a thickness to chord ratio of 14.5%, which was slightly thicker than the Supermarine Spitfire's 13%.

Another major difference was the much higher wing loading than the other designs. While the R-IV contract called for a wing loading of less than 100 kg/m², Messerschmitt felt this was unreasonable; with the engines available to them, the fighter would end up slower than the bombers it was tasked with catching.

A wing generates two forms of drag, parasitic drag due to its form, and induced drag which is a side effect of generating lift. The former dominates at high speeds, when the airflow hitting the wing causes drag that rises with the square of the aircraft's speed. The latter dominates at lower speeds, where the lack of airflow requires the wing to be angled into the airflow at a higher angle of attack. Since the fighter was being designed primarily for high speed flight, a smaller wing would be optimised for high speed use.

The downside of such a trade-off is that low-speed flight would suffer, as the smaller wing would require more airflow to generate enough lift to stay flying. In order to address this, the Bf 109 included advanced high-lift devices on the wings, including automatically opening slats on the leading edge, and fairly large camber-changing flaps on the trailing edge. Messerschmitt also included ailerons that "drooped" when the flaps were lowered thereby increasing the effective flap area when the flaps were deployed. When deployed, these devices effectively increased the coefficient of lift, making it better at low speeds and high angles of attack.

Another drawback of the high wing loading is that the fighter would require more energy to manoeuvre. Given the limited amount of power available, this effectively meant the Bf 109 could not turn as tightly as other designs with larger wings. The high lift devices would offset this to some degree, but they also increased drag and so slowed the aircraft further. Given that manoeuvrability was last on the RLM's wish list, Messerschmitt was certain the benefits outweighed the drawbacks.

By 1937 it had become clear that the 109 was too lightly armed, especially when compared with the eight machine guns which armed the new MG FF or MG FF/M. The first version of the 109 to have wing guns was the C-1, which had one MG 17 per wing fitted in the inner bays. To avoid redesigning the wing to accommodate large ammunition boxes and access hatches  an unusual ammunition feed was devised whereby a continuous belt, holding 500 rounds of ammunition, was fed along chutes out to the wingtips. The belt was fed around a roller and back along the wing, forward and beneath the gun breech, to the wingroot where it was fed around another roller and back to the weapon. The gun barrels were buried in long, large diameter tubes between the spar and the leading edge. These tubes channelled cooling air around the barrels and breeches and was ejected via a slot at the rear of the wing diaphragm and top of the flap. Room was still so restricted that parts of the MG 17's breech mechanism poked into an accommodating hole in the flap structure.<ref name="Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 15.">Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 15.</ref>

The much longer and heavier MG FF had to be mounted in the outer bay. A large hole was to be cut through the spar webbing to allow the cannon to be fitted with ammunition feed forward of the spar and the rear breech block projecting through the spar. The 60 round ammunition drum was placed in the machine-gun compartment; a small hatch incorporating a blister was needed in the wing lower surface to allow access to change the drum. The entire weapon could be removed for servicing by removing a leading edge panel.<ref name="Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 15."/> From the 109F series  very few 109s had weapons mounted within the wings, with any additional guns being mounted in drag-inducing pods under the wings.

===Speed records===
On 11 November 1937 Messerschmitt regained some favour with Erhard Milch with the Bf 109 V13 increasing the world's air speed record for ''Landplanes with piston engines'' <ref>Note: World Speed Records and other aviation records were and still are set by the ''Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI)''. A record needs to be set over a recognised course at a set altitude to be valid. The Bf 109 and 209s came under the category '''CLASS C, GROUP 1d'''</ref><ref>[http://www.fai.org/news_archives/fai/cat_world_records.asp FAI record (current)]Retrieved: 29 April 2008</ref> to . The "V13" had been fitted with a special racing version of the DB 601 engine, as a result the power of the engine could reach 1,650 hp for short periods<ref> Feist 1993, p. 21.</ref>.

Bf 209 V1 a racing aircraft bearing little in common with the Bf 109, powered by the DB 601ARJ, producing 1,550 hp but capable of reaching 2,300 hp, raised the figure to . This world record for a propeller driven aircraft was to stand until 1969<ref> Feist 1993, p. 22.</ref>.

==Models==
===Bf 109 A/B/C===
thumb|109B
thumb|109C
The Bf '''109A''' ("Anton") was the first version of the Bf 109. The armament, planned to be only two cowl-mounted 7.92 mm Republican troops on 11 November 1937 and later transferred to the Soviet Union for a closer inspection <ref>[http://moskittech.ru/eng/myze/Bf-109B-1/Bf-109B-1.htm Bf 109B]</ref>. '''6-15''' incorporated several improvements from the Bf 109B production program and was able to use the variable-pitch propeller.

According to RLM documentation 22 aircraft were ordered and delivered with '''V4''' as the A-series prototype. <ref>RLM Flugzeugbeschaffungs-Programm Nr. 7a, 01.04.1938 (Deliveries up to 30.11.1937)</ref> 

The first Bf 109 in serial production, the Bf '''109B''' ("Bruno"), was fitted with the 670 PS (660 hp, 493 kW) Jumo 210D engine driving a two-bladed fixed-pitch propeller. During the '''B-1''' production run a variable pitch propeller was introduced and often retrofitted to older aircraft, these were then unofficially known as '''B-2'''s. Both versions saw combat with the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War, although it was apparent that the armament was still inadequate. Several aircraft were produced with an engine-mounted machine gun but it was very unreliable again, most likely because of engine vibrations and overheating. Thus the Bf 109 '''V8''' was constructed to test the fitting of two more machine guns in the wings. Results showed that the wing needed strengthening. <ref>Feist 1993, p. 19.</ref> In the following '''V9''' prototype both wing guns were replaced by 20 mm MG FF cannons.<ref>Feist 1993, p. 20.</ref>

A total of 341 Bf 109B of all versions were built by Messerschmitt, Fieseler, and Erla. <ref name="RLM Nr.10">RLM Flugzeugbeschaffungs-Programm Nr. 10 von 01.01.1939 (Deliveries up to 31.12.1938)</ref>

The short-lived Bf '''109C''' ("Caesar") was powered by a 700 PS Jumo 210G engine with direct fuel injection. Another important change was a strengthened wing, now carrying two more machine guns giving four MG 17 in total. The '''C-0''' were pre-production aircraft, the '''C-1''' was the production version, the '''C-2''' an experimental version with an engine-mounted machine gun. The '''C-3''' was planned with 20 mm MG FF cannons replacing the two MG 17 machine guns in the wings but its not known how many C-3 (if any) were built. The '''C-4''' was planned to have an engine mounted MG FF, but the variant was not produced.<ref>Feist 1993, p. 151.</ref>

A total of 58 Bf 109C of all versions were built by Messerschmitt. <ref name="RLM Nr.10">RLM Flugzeugbeschaffungs-Programm Nr. 10, 01.01.1939 (Deliveries up to 31.12.1938)</ref>

The next model, the '''V10''' prototype, was identical to the V8, except for its Jumo 210G engine. The V10, '''V11''', '''V12''' and '''V13''' prototypes were built using Bf 109B airframes, and tested the DB600A engine with the hope of increasing the performance of the aircraft. However the DB600A was found to be unreliable, and as the improved DB601A was to become available soon, the DB600A was dropped.

===Bf 109D "Dora"===
thumb|Bf 109D

Developed from the V10 and V13 prototypes, the "Dora" was the standard version of the Bf 109 in service with the ''Luftwaffe'' during the period just before World War II. Despite this, the type saw only limited service during the war, as all of the 235 Doras still in service at the beginning of the Polish campaign were rapidly taken out of service and replaced by the Bf 109E, except in some night fighter units, where some examples were used into early 1940. Variants included '''D-0''' and '''D-1''' Models, both with a Junkers Jumo 210D engine and armed with two wing-mounted and two nose-mounted 7.92mm MG 17 machine guns.<ref>Feist 1993, p. 22.</ref> The '''D-2''' was an experimental version with an engine mounted machine gun but this installation failed again. The '''D-3''' was similar to the C-3 with two 20mm MG FF cannon in the wings. 

A total of 647 Bf 109D of all versions were built by Focke-Wulf, Erla, Fieseler, Arado and AGO. <ref name="RLM Nr.10">RLM Flugzeugbeschaffungs-Programm Nr. 10, 01.01.1939 (Deliveries up to 31.12.1938)</ref> Messerschmitt is listed as having only four Bf 109D produced, probably the D-0 preproduction series with the serial production transferred to license manufacturers. Several Bf 109D were sold to Hungary and Switzerland.

===Bf 109E "Emil"===
To test the new DB601A engine, with its 1,100 PS (1,085 hp, 809 kW), two more prototypes, the '''V14''' and '''V15''', were built, that differed in their armament. While the V14 was armed with the two MG 17 above the engine and one 20 mm MG FF cannon in each wing, the V15 was fitted with just two MG 17s mounted above the engine only.<ref>Feist 1993, p. 23.</ref> After test fights the V14 was considered more promising and a pre-production batch of 10 '''E-0''' was ordered. Batches of both E-1 and E-3 variants were shipped to Spain for evaluation, and received their baptism of fire in the final phases of the Spanish Civil War.

thumb|Bf 109E-3

The production version '''E-1''' kept the two 7.92 mm MG 17s above the engine and had two MG 17s in the wings. Later many were modified to the E-3 armament standard. The '''E-1B''' was a small batch of E-1s becoming the first operational Bf 109 fighter bomber, or ''Jagdbomber'' (usually abbreviated to '''Jabo'''). They were fitted with either a ETC 250 bomb rack, carrying one 250 kg bomb or two ETC 50 bomb racks, carrying a 50 kg bomb under each wing. The E-1 was also fitted with the Reflexvisier "Revi" gunsight. Communications equipment was the FuG 7 ''Funkgerät 7'' (radio set) short-range radio equipment, effective to ranges of 30-35 miles. 

A total of 1,183 E-1 were built, 110 of them were E-1/B.<ref name="RLM Nr.10">RLM Lieferplan Nr. 18 Ausgabe 3, 01.11.1940 (Deliveries up to 31.10.1940)</ref>

The '''E-2''' was not built for unknown reasons, probably another failed attempt to install an engine mounted machine gun or ''Motorkanone'' cannon.

To improve the performance of the Bf 109E, the last two real prototypes were constructed, the '''V16''' and '''V17'''. They got some structural improvements and stronger armament. These prototypes were the basis of the Bf '''109 E-3''' version. They were armed with the two MG 17s above the engine and one MG FF cannon in each wing. <ref name="hannu">Hannu Valtonen &mdash; Messerschmitt Bf 109 ja saksan sotatalous</ref> The E-3 also received additional armour, many receiving self sealing fuel tanks and an optional, improved DB601Aa with 1,175 PS (1,159 hp, 864 kW) respectively. 

A total of 1,276 E-3 were built, 75 of them were '''E-3a''' export versions without equipment classified as secret.<ref name="RLM Nr.18">RLM Lieferplan Nr. 18 Ausgabe 3, 01.11.1940 (Deliveries up to 31.10.1940)</ref>

The E-3 was replaced by the '''E-4''' (with many airframes being upgraded to E-4 standards starting at beginning of the Battle of Britain) which was different in some small details, most notably by the modified MG-FF/M wing cannon and by improved head armor for the pilot. The MG FF/M fired a new and improved type of explosive shell, called Minengeschoß (or 'mine-shell') which was made by drawn steel (the same way brass cartridges are made) instead of being cast as was the usual practice. This resulted in a shell with a thin but strong wall, which  had a larger cavity in which to pack a much larger explosive charge than was otherwise possible. The new shell required modifications to the MG FF's mechanism due to the different recoil characteristics, hence the MG FF/M-this special /M designation has also been thought to designate a ''Motorkanone'' version of the MG FF cannon. 

The canopy was also revised to an easier-to-produce, "squared-off" design, and stayed fairly unchanged until the introduction of welded, heavy framed canopy on the G series in the autumn of 1942. The E-4 would be the base for all further Bf 109 E developments. Some E-4 and later models got a further improved 1,175 PS DB601N high-altitude engine resulting in a slightly changed model number; this E-4/N, first appeared in July 1940. The E-4 was also available as fighter-bomber with equipment very similar to the previous E-1/B. It was known as '''E-4/B''' (DB 601Aa engine) and '''E-4/BN''' (DB 601N engine). 

496 E-4 of all versions were built - 250 E-4, 20 E-4/N, 211 E-4/B and 15 E-4/BN.<ref name="RLM Nr.18">RLM Lieferplan Nr. 18 Ausgabe 3, 01.11.1940 (Deliveries up to 31.10.1940)</ref>

The E-5 and E-6 were both reconnaissance variant with a camera installation behind the cockpit. The '''E-5''' was a reconnaissance variant of the E-3, the '''E-6''' was a reconnaissance variant of the E-4/N. 

29 E-5s were built and 9 E-6 were ordered. <ref name="RLM Nr.18">RLM Lieferplan Nr. 18 Ausgabe 3, 01.11.1940 (Deliveries up to 31.10.1940)</ref>

The '''E-7''' was the next major production variant. It was based on the E-4/B and was able to carry a drop tank, which greatly increased their range, or a bomb to be used as fighter-bomber. As the DB 601N was still not available in large numbers many E-7 used a mix of DB 601A, Aa or N engines with the latter designated as E-7/N.

The E-1 and E-4 saw the most heavy action during the carburetted engines, which would cut out under negative ''g'' forces whereas the DB601 did not. The Bf 109s thus had the initial advantage in dives, either during attack or to escape. The Spitfire proved a formidable opponent, being approximately as fast and allegedly able to out-turn the 109 at medium to high speeds, due to the Bf 109's high wing loading. On the question of comparative turning circles in combat, Spitfires and Hurricanes benefited from their lower wing loading compared with the Bf109; 22 to 24 pounds per square foot on the RAF machines against 32 pounds per square foot for the Bf 109. Royal Aircraft Establishment tests with a captured Bf 109 showed the Spitfire's turning circle — without height loss — was 696 feet (212 m) in radius (the Hurricane's would be slightly tighter) while the 109's was 885 feet (270 m) radius according to British calculations using assumed values as basis. According to the German manuals however, the smallest turning circle was 170 m, and fighter pilots on both sides claim they would out-turn their opponents in combat. Another source states the following:
:Tightest turn radius at ground level = 125 m = 410 ft
:Tightest turn radius at 6km = 230 m = 754 ft<ref>[http://www.virtualpilots.fi/feature/articles/109myths/#109hard Bf 109 myths]Retrieved: 24 April 2008 Note: Quoted from website: Messerschmitt Bf 109 A-E, Development - Testing - Production" by Willy Radinger & Walter Schick. In the foreword it states that work on the book was begun in 1994 and Walter Schick died in 1995. It states he is writing the book to correct the many errors that have crept into aviation books over the years. Several Messerschmitt employees helped out in the book, one of which is Lukas Schmid who began working there in 1934 and was group leader on the project in 1937 and subsequently a flight test pilot.
The book lists many statistics, even the Werknummer of the prototypes and types of aircraft produced in low numbers.</ref> 
In roll rates the Bf 109 enjoyed an advantage at dogfight speeds, though at high speeds the manoeuvrability of all three fighters, especially the Spitfire, was severely limited in this regard. The Bf 109 enjoyed good handling near stalling speed. In the Battle of Britain, the Bf 109 was at a disadvantage due to its short range. After escorting bombers from their bases in northern France, The Netherlands and Germany, the Messerschmitt had only around 15 minutes of fuel for combat over southern England before having to turn back. The Spitfire and Hurricane, operating virtually over their home airfields and having a greater range, had a tactical advantage in being able to remain longer in the combat area and having the option to pursue any targets if needed.

Firepower was comparable, with the Spitfire and Hurricane having eight .303 inch (7.7 mm) machine-guns versus the Bf 109's two 7.92 mm MG17s and two 20 mm MG FF cannon. However, the MG FF occasionally jammed and had a small (60-round) ammunition capacity. To be fair, when the Spitfires were later upgraded to two 20 mm Hispano-Suiza cannon, the British fighter initially had serious jamming problems with the new weapon. RAF pilots who tested captured Bf 109s liked the engine and throttle response but criticised the high speed handling characteristics, poorer turning circle, greater force required on the control column at speed, and the thick framing of the cockpit glazing which they felt created blindspots in the pilot's field of vision.

In August 1940 comparative trials were held at the E-Stelle in Rechlin<ref>[http://kurfurst.allaboutwarfare.com/Tactical_trials/109E_vergleich110SpitHurCurtiss/109E_vergleichsflg_Aug1940.html 109 against Allied fighters]</ref>, with famous ace Werner Mölders being one of the participants. The tests concluded that the Bf 109 had superior level and climb speed to the Spitfire at all altitudes, but also noted the significantly smaller turning circle of the British fighter. It was advised not to engage into turn-fights unless the performance advantage of the Bf 109 could be used to full effect. The roll rate of the Bf 109 was deemed superior as was its stability on target approach. Moelders himself called the Spitfire "miserable as a fighting aircraft", due to its two-pitch propeller and the inability of its carburettor to handle negative g-forces.<ref>Price 1996, p. 61.</ref>

===Bf 109F "Friedrich"===
thumb|Messerschmitt Bf 109 F-2
After February 1940 an improved engine, the Daimler-Benz DB 601E, was developed for use with the Bf 109.
The engineers at the Messerschmitt facilities took two Bf 109E-1 airframes and installed this new powerplant. The first two prototypes, '''V21''' (''Werksnummer'' (Works  number) or W.Nr 5602) and '''V22''' (W.Nr 1800) kept the trapeziform wing shape from the E-1, but the span was reduced by 61 cm (2 ft) by "clipping" the tips. Otherwise the wings incorporated the cooling system modifications described below. '''V22''' also became the testbed for the pre-production DB 601E. The smaller wings had a detrimental effect on the handling so '''V23''', ''Stammkennzeichen'' (factory Code<ref>Note:  These factory codes were used by all second line aircraft such as trainers, communication, some Air Service aircraft and others not engaged in operational use.[http://www.afrikakorps.org/stammkennzeichen.htm Stammkennzeichen]</ref>) ''CE+BP'', W.Nr 5603, was fitted with new, semi elliptical wingtips. The fourth prototype, '''V24''' ''VK+AB'', W.Nr 5604, flew with the clipped wings but featured a modified, "elbow" shaped supercharger air intake which was eventually adopted for production, and a deeper oil cooler bath beneath the cowling.<ref name="Green 1980, pp. 84–86.">Green 1980, pp. 84–86.</ref> On all of these prototypes the fuselage was cleaned up and the engine cowling modified to provide improved aerodynamics. The spinner, which was adapted from that of the new Messerschmitt Me 210 was much larger and more rounded. 

The rudder was slightly reduced in area and the symmetrical fin section changed to an airfoil shape, which helped increase the effectiveness of the rudder. The conspicuous bracing struts were removed from the horizontal tailplanes which were placed slightly below and forward of their original positions. A semi-retractable tailwheel was fitted and the main undercarriage legs were raked forward by six degrees to improve the ground handling. As the DB601E was not yet available in numbers the pre-production '''F-0''' (the only F variant to have a rectangular supercharger intake) and the first production series '''F-1/F-2''' received the 1,175 hp (875 kW) DB601N engine. The 1,350 hp (1,005 kW) DB601E was first used in the '''F-3''' model together with an enlarged propeller for improved performance.<ref name="Green 1980, pp. 84–86."/>

Externally the Bf 109F had many aerodynamic improvements over the E series. The propeller unit was   a three bladed VDM unit 2.96 meters (9 ft 8.5 in) in diameter, slightly smaller than that of the E although the blades were slightly wider. The engine cowling was redesigned to be smoother and more rounded and incorporated a new ejector exhaust arrangement. The supercharger air-intake, still on the left cowling was, from the F-1 series on, a rounded, "elbow" shape which protruded further out into the airstream. On later aircraft the left hand exhaust was fitted with a metal shield to stop exhaust fumes from entering the supercharger intake. Underneath the cowling was a revised, more streamlined oil cooler radiator and fairing. The canopy stayed essentially the same as that of the E-4 although the handbook for the F stipulated that the forward, lower triangular panel to starboard was to be replaced by a metal panel with a port for firing signal flares. Many F-1s and F-2s kept this section glazed. A two-piece, all metal armour plate head shield was added to the hinged portion of the canopy, although some lacked the curved top section. A bullet-resistant windscreen could be fitted to the windscreen as an option.<ref name="Prien and Rodeike 1995, pp. 11–18.">Prien and Rodeike 1995, pp. 11–18.</ref>

The wings were redesigned, incorporating revised slats and flaps, along with more streamlined radiator baths. A new cooling system was introduced which was regulated by a system of interconnected variable position flaps which would balance the lowest drag possible with the most efficient cooling possible. A new radiator, shallower but longer than that fitted to the E was developed. A boundary layer duct allowed continual airflow to pass through the airfoil above the radiator ducting and exit from the trailing edge of the upper split flap. The lower split flap was mechanically linked to the central "main" flap, while the upper split flap and forward bath lip position were regulated via a thermostatic valve which automatically positioned the flaps for maximum cooling effectiveness. <ref>[http://109lair.hobbyvista.com/index1024.htm 109 F cooling system]Retrieved: 24 April 2008.</ref> In 1941 "cutoff" valves were introduced which allowed the pilot to shut down either wing radiator in the event of one being damaged; this allowed the remaining coolant to be preserved. However, these valves were only delivered to frontline units as kits, the number of which, for unknown reasons, was limited. These cutoff valves were never made available for G or K series 109s.<ref>Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 12.</ref> Other features of the redesigned wings included new leading edge slats, which were slightly shorter but had a slightly  increased chord, and new rounded, removable wingtips which changed the profile of the wings and increased the span slightly over that of the E series.
	
The redesigned wing made the internal mounting of guns impractical, so armament was revised. The armament of the Bf 109F consisted of the two MG 17 above the engine plus a ''Motorkanone'' cannon firing through the propeller hub: The early F versions were equipped with the MG FF/M cannon, the F-2 got the 15 mm MG 151, and from '''F-4''' on the 20 mm MG 151/20 was used. Several aces, particularly Oberst Adolf Galland, criticised the light armament as inadequate for the average pilot. Major Walter Oesau refused to fly an F as long as Emil's were still available. Only after a lack of spare parts, did he accept an F. Later on, an attachment of underwing 20 mm cannons addressed the issue of fire-power, but at a price to performance. Werner Mölders on the other hand saw the single centerline gun as an improvement. It is possible that the criticism of the Bf 109F's armament is based on the early F-2 version with the 15 mm MG 151/15 cannon, which was later replaced by the 20 mm version of the same weapon and was praised for being highly effective by aces like Günther Rall.

The first Bf 109Fs were rushed into service; consequently some aircraft crashed or nearly crashed, with either the wing surface wrinkling or fracturing, or by the tail structure failing. In one such accident, the commander of JG 2 "Richthofen", oscillation in the tailplane spar was overlapped by vibrations from the engine; together this was enough to cause structural failure at the rear fuselage/fin attachment point. Initially two external stiffening plates were screwed onto the outer fuselage on each side and later the entire structure was reinforced.<ref name="Green 1980, pp. 84–86."/>

With these problems out of the way, pilots generally agreed that the F series were the best-handling of all the Bf 109 series. Werner Mölders flew one of the first operational Bf 109F-1s over England from early October 1940; he may well have been credited with shooting down eight Hurricanes and four Spitfires while flying ''W.No 5628'', ''Stammkennzeichen'' ''SG+GW'' between 11 October and 29 October 1940.<ref> Prien and Rodeike 1995, pp. 8–9.</ref><ref>[http://www.luftwaffe.cz/molders.html Mölders victory list] Retrieved: 20 April 2008.</ref>

===Bf 109G "Gustav"===
The Bf 109 G-series was developed from the F-series airframe although there were several differences. This series used the 1,475 PS Daimler-Benz DB 605. Modifications included reinforced wing structure, an internal bullet-proof windscreen, the use of heavier, welded framing for the cockpit transparencies, and additional light-alloy armour for the fuel tank and armouring of the radiators.<ref>Messerschmitt A.G. - Leistungzusammenstellung Me 109 G. January 1944.</ref><ref>[http://kurfurst.allaboutwarfare.com/Performance_tests/109G_Leistungzusammenstellung/Leistungzusammenstellung109G.html]</ref>It was originally intended that the wheel wells would incorporate small doors to cover the outer portion of the wheels when retracted. To incorporate these the outer wheel bays were squared off. Two small inlet scoops for additional cooling of the spark plugs were added on both sides of the forward engine cowlings. A less obvious difference was the omission of the boundary layer bypass outlets, which had been a feature of the F series, on the upper radiator flaps.<ref name="Prien and Rodeike, 1995.">Prien and Rodieke 1995</ref><ref>[http://109lair.hobbyvista.com/index1024.htm Bf 109F, G and K radiator design]Retrieved 23 February 2008</ref>

The G-series was designed to adapt to different operational tasks with greater versatility, using field kits known as ''Rüstsätze''. Special high-altitude interceptors with GM 1 high-altitude boost and pressurized cockpits were also produced.

The "new" Daimler-Benz DB 605A series was a development of the DB 601E engine utilised by the preceding Bf 109F-4. This was achieved through increasing the displacement and the compression ratio, as well as other detail improvements. The DB605 suffered from reliability problems during the first year of operation, forcing ''Luftwaffe'' units to limit maximum power output to 1,310 PS (975 kW) at 2,600 rpm and 1.3ata manifold pressure, until October 1943, when the full 1475 PS rating at 2800 rpm, 1.42ata manifold pressure was cleared for service use.

The early versions of the '''Bf 109G''' closely  resembled the Bf 109F-4 and carried the same basic armament - however, as the basic airframe was modified to keep pace with different operational requirements, the basically clean design began to change. From the spring of 1943, the G-series saw the appearance of bulges in the cowling when the 7.92 mm MG 17 was replaced with the 13 mm MG 131 heavy machine guns ('''G-5''' onwards) due to the latter's much larger breechblock, and on the wings (due to larger tyres), leading to the Bf 109G-6s nickname "Die Beule" ("The Bulge"). The Gustav continued to be improved constantly: cockpit visibility, firepower in the form of the 30mm MK 108 cannon was added to the basic design in 1943, and a new, enlarged supercharger for the DB605, an enlarged vertical stabilizer (G-5 onwards), MW 50 power boost in 1944. It has been suggested the added weight of the new engines and heavier armament adversely affected the handling characteristics of the Bf 109, especially since it already had a high wing loading. While technically the statement is true, it is somewhat unfair as analysis show only a modest increase in weight as a result of development, fairly comparable to the development trend with Western Allied fighters.
