'''Las Américas International Airport''' (Spanish: ''Aeropuerto Internacional Las Américas-JFPG'')  is an international airport located in Punta Caucedo, near Santo Domingo and Boca Chica in the Dominican Republic.  The airport is run by Aeropuertos Dominicanos Siglo XXI (AERODOM), a Dominican Republic-based private corporation, with a 25-year concession to build, operate, and transfer (BOT) 6 airports in the Dominican Republic. 

Recently, the expressway leading from Santo Domingo to the airport (roughly 20 km east of the city center) was expanded and modernised.  The new expressway crosses a new suspension bridge which spans the Ozama River, connecting traffic into the city's Elevated Freeway and Tunnel system onto the city's main street, Av. 27 de Febrero.  A more scenic route following the coastal shore provides beautiful views of the Caribbean Sea and of the city.  This secondary road crosses the Ozama River by means of a floating bridge, connecting traffic onto the Av. George Washington (el Malecón) which leads into the heart of the colonial city.  

The airport is the largest in the Dominican Republic and one of the largest in the Caribbean, handling over 3 million passengers per year through its air terminal. 

== History ==

Las Américas Airport was opened in 1959<ref>http://www.laplana.com.do/?module=displaystory&story_id=12717&format=html</ref> as the official airport of Santo Domingo.

The official name of the airport was changed in 2002 to "Aeropuerto Internacional Las Américas- José Francisco Peña Gómez (AIJFPG)" but is most commonly referred to as "Las Américas International Airport", or locally, "Las Américas".

On San Juan, Puerto Rico, crashed, killing all 102 persons on board (see: Dominicana DC-9 air disaster).

''Las Américas'' was the hub for PAWA Dominicana, and SAP Air. Las Américas Airport will serve as hub for the new Dominican flag carrier Air Dominicana, who intends to enter into service in June 2008.

Las Américas also has served as a hub for airlines such as Aeromar Líneas Aéreas Dominicanas, Air Santo Domingo, Aero Continente Dominicana, and Queen Air.

== The new Northern terminal ==

This new terminal is complete and open for operations. It can accommodate four Boeing 747s simultaneously. This new terminal has four gates with boarding bridges, an air-conditioning system, and maintenance facilities for aircraft. 

== Runway ==

Las Américas' runway direction is 17/35. This runway is the largest in the country, with a length of 3,353 m. It can support an Airbus A380 without problems. The runway of SDQ is currently under reconstruction and will be in use again in June 2008.

== Airlines and destinations ==
=== Terminals ===

Las Américas has 6 gates on the main satellite concourse (A), A1 through A6, which have a shared use. In the same concourse there is an American Eagle gate, A7. Other gate facilities are for the flights departing from a parking in the taxiway.

The Concourse B has 4 gates, B1 through B4, and an American Eagle's gate B1A. This Terminal B is the most modern terminal in all the country and one of the best of the Caribbean.
