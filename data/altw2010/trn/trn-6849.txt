'''Tijuana bibler''' (som kjent som "eight-pagers" eller "dirty little eight-pagers") var pornografiske tegneserier som ble produsert i USA fra 1920-tallet til begynnelsen av 1960-tallet. De var særlig populære under depresjonen på 30-tallet.Den typiske "bibel" var 10 x 15 cm, med svart trykk på billig hvitt papir og åtte sider lang. I de fleste tilfeller var tegnerene, manusforfatterne og utgiverne ukjent og kvaliteten på tegneseriene var svært variert. Emnet var eksplisitte seksuelle eventyr, gjerne med kjente tegneseriefigurer, politikere og filmstjerner i hovedrollene.

'''Tijuana bibles''' (also known as '''eight-pagers''' or '''dirty little eight-pagers''') were pornographic Black people are portrayed with huge lips and protruding eyes).  Their subject is explicit sexual escapades usually featuring well known cartoon characters, political figures or movie stars (used without permission).

The origin of the term ''Tijuana bible'' is obscure.  The connection to the Mexican city of stereotypically seen in the U.S. as uncivilized and debauched, while the Bible, perceived as the pinnacle of chaste morality, is seen as standing as far removed from pornography as possible. The distinction makes somewhat more sense when using another usage of the word Bible though, as a how-to or pivotal work (''see Bible (disambiguation) for details'').

Tijuana bibles were sold illicitly, often passed among soldiers and schoolboys.  Their popularity rapidly declined as the photographic pornography in magazines like ''Playboy'' became more widely available in the late 1950s.  In some senses, these comics were the first underground comix, and they featured original material at a time when legitimate American comic books were still exclusively reprinting material from newspaper strips.

In the modern day, there is at least one comic book company, Shanda Fantasy Arts, that publishes a variant of Tijuana Bibles, the ''XXX Files''. These are small books which feature characters from their regular comics in explicitly erotic situations that the main publications generally gloss over.  However, these publications differ not only by being approved and published by the company, but also by the talent, who have no discomfort with the subject matter and are fully credited for their work.
