'''Surf City''' est une chanson du groupe américain 1963. Le premier jet de la chanson '''Surf City''' (appelée ''Goody Connie Won't You Come Back Home'' lors de sa composition) a été écrit par Brian Wilson des The Beach Boys. Il la donna, contre la volonté de son père et manager Murry Wilson, à ses amis Jan Berry et Dean Torrence de Jan & Dean qui terminèrent sa composition et son enregistrement avec Brian Wilson au début des années 1960.

En 1991, après avoir déménagé dans la ville de Huntington Beach en Californie, Torrence convint les autorités à surnommer officiellement la ville comme étant « Surf City »<ref>http://surfcityusa.com/about/HB_Fall2006_coverstory.pdf</ref> (littéralement ''La ville du surf'').

'''"Surf City"''' is a surf song which, as recorded by jan and Dean, was a number one hit in 1963.

The first draft of the song, with (working title "Goody Connie Won't You Come Back Home", was written by Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys. He gave it to Jan Berry and Dean Torrence of Jan and Dean who finished writing and recording it with Wilson in the early 1960s. Although Torrence contributed several important phrases to the song and kept the original lyrics which were scanned and now appear on the official Jan and Dean website, Torrence never insisted that his name should be recognized on the label as one of the authors of the song and his contribution is often overlooked. 

"Surf City" became the first surf song to reach number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1963. In 1991, after moving to the city of Huntington Beach, California, Torrence went on to help convince elected officials that his new home town should be officially nicknamed "Surf City" [http://surfcityusa.com/contact/info.html]. The name has been enthusiastically embraced and today more than 65 businesses in the city include "Surf City" as part of their name, the largest concentration of Surf City businesses in the world.

Torrence was also part of the team that developed the Surf City USA brand championed by the Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau.
