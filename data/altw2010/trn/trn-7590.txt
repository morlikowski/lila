The '''noble eightfold path''' is, in the teachings of the Buddha, declared to be the way that leads to the cessation of suffering (''dukkha'') and the achievement of self-awakening.<ref></ref> The noble eightfold path is used as an instrument of discovery to gradually generate insights unveiling the ultimate truth of things. It is a technique used to eradicate greed, hatred and delusion. The last of the four noble truths is the noble eightfold path, while the first factor of the noble eightfold path is the understanding of the four noble truths. 
In all of the elements of the noble eightfold path, the word "Right" is a translation of the word ''samyañc'' (Sanskrit) or ''sammā'' (Pāli), which denotes completion, togetherness, and coherence, and which can also carry the sense of "perfect" or "ideal".<ref>See, for instance, [http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/8foldpath.htm Allan (2008).]</ref>
In Buddhist symbolism, the noble eightfold path is often represented by means of the dharma wheel, whose eight spokes represent the eight elements of the path. 

==Origin==

According to the Pali canon discourses, the noble eightfold path was rediscovered by Gautama Buddha during his quest for enlightenment. It is believed to be an ancient path which has been followed and practiced by all the previous Buddhas. The noble eightfold path is a practice that will lead its practitioner toward self-awakening and liberation. It was revealed by the Buddha to his disciples, so that they could follow the very same path.

:"In the same way I saw an ancient path, an ancient road, traveled by the Rightly Self-awakened Ones of former times. And what is that ancient path, that ancient road, traveled by the Rightly Self-awakened Ones of former times? Just this noble eightfold path: right view, right aspiration, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration...I followed that path. Following it, I came to direct knowledge of aging & death, direct knowledge of the origination of aging & death, direct knowledge of the cessation of aging & death, direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of aging & death...Knowing that directly, I have revealed it to monks, nuns, male lay followers & female lay followers..."<ref></ref>

The practice of the noble eightfold path varies between different Buddhist schools. Today the path either has been modified, is practiced only in part, or is practiced as a whole. Each Buddhist practice lineage claimed they are able to implement the Noble Eightfold Path in the manner most condusive to the development of their students. In some cases that has led to aspects of the Noble Eightfold Path to be abandoned.

==The threefold division of the path==
The noble eightfold path is sometimes divided into three basic divisions.<ref></ref>The three basic divisions are as follows:

==The practice==
According to the Buddhist monk and scholar Walpola Rahula, the divisions of the noble eightfold path "are to be developed more or less simultaneously, as far as possible according to the capacity of each individual. They are all linked together and each helps the cultivation of the others."<ref>Rahula 46</ref> Bhikkhu Bodhi explained "with a certain degree of progress all eight factors can be present simultaneously, each supporting the others. However, until that point is reached, some sequence in the unfolding of the path is inevitable".<ref></ref>

According to the Pali Canon discourses, right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness are used as the support and requisite conditions for the practice of right concentration. Understanding of the right view is the preliminary role, and is also the forerunner of the entire Noble Eightfold Path.<ref></ref> The practitioner should first try to understand the concepts of right view. Once right view has been understood, it will inspire and encourage the arising of right intention within the practitioner. Right intention will lead to the arising of right speech. Right speech will lead to the arising of right action. Right action will lead to the arising of right livelihood. Right livelihood will lead to the arising of right effort. Right effort will lead to the arising of right mindfulness.<ref></ref> The practitioner must make the right effort to abandon the wrong view and to enter into the right view. Right mindfulness is used in order to constantly remain in the right view.<ref></ref> This will help the practitioner restrain their greed, hatred and delusion.

Once these support and requisite conditions have been established, the practitioner can then practice right concentration with ease. During the practice of right concentration, the practitioner will need to use right effort and right mindfulness to aid their concentration practice. In the state of concentration, the practitioner will need to investigate and verify their understanding of right view. This will then result in the arising of right knowledge, which will eliminate greed, hatred and delusion. The last and final factor to arise is right liberation.

==Wisdom (''Prajñā'' • ''Paññā'')==
"Wisdom", sometimes translated as "discernment" at its preparatory role, provides the sense of direction with its conceptual understanding of reality. It is designed to awaken the faculty of penetrative understanding to see things as they really are. At a later stage, when the mind has been refined by training in moral discipline and concentration, and with the gradual arising of right knowledge, it will arrive at a superior right view and right intention. <ref></ref>

===Right view===
Right view ('''' • '''') can also be translated as "right perspective", "right vision" or "right understanding". It is the right way of looking at life, nature and the world as they really are. It is to understand how reality works. It acts as the reasoning for the practictioner to start practicing the path. It explains the reasons for human existence, suffering, sickness, aging, death, the existence of greed, hatred and delusion. It gives direction and efficacy to the other seven path factors.  Right view begins with concepts and propositional knowledge but through the practice of right concentration it gradually becomes transmuted into wisdom which can eradicate the fetters of the mind.  Understanding of right view will inspire the person to lead a virtuous life in line with right view. In the Pali Canon, it is explained as:
:"And what is right view? Knowledge with reference to stress (dukkha can also be translated as suffering), knowledge with reference to the origination of stress (or suffering), knowledge with reference to the cessation of stress (or suffering), knowledge with reference to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress (or suffering): This is called right view."<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

There are two types of right view:
#'''View with taints''' – this view is mundane. Having this type of view will bring merit and will support the favourable existence of the sentient being in the realm of samsara.
#'''View without taints''' – this view is supramundane. It is a factor of the path and will lead the holder of this view toward self-awakening and liberation from the realm of samsara.

Right view has many facets, its elementary form is suitable for lay followers, while the other which requires deeper understanding is suitable for monastic. Usually it involves understanding the following reality:
#'''Moral law of karma''' - Every action (by way of body, speech and mind) will have karmic results. Wholesome and unwholesome actions will produce results and effects that correspond with the nature of that action. It is the right view about the moral process of the world.
#'''The three characteristics''' – everything that arises will cease (impermanence). Mental and body phenomena are impermanent, source of suffering and not-self.
#'''Suffering''' - Birth, aging, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, distress and despair are suffering. Not being able to obtain what one wants is also suffering. The arising of craving is the root cause of the arising of suffering and the cessation of craving is the root cause of the cessation of the suffering. The way leading to the cessation of suffering is the noble eightfold path. <ref></ref> This type of right view is explained in term of Four Noble Truths.

Right view for monastics is explained in detail in the '''' ("Right View Discourse"), in which Ven. twelve ''nidanas'' or the three taints.<ref></ref>
"Wrong view" arising from ignorance (''avijja''), is the precondition for wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness and wrong concentration.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The practitioner should use right effort to abandon the wrong view and to enter into right view. Right mindfulness is used in order to constantly remain in right view. 

The purpose of right view is to clear one's path of the majority of confusion, misunderstanding and deluded thinking. It is a means to gain right understanding of reality. According to the Pali Canon commentary, right view should be held with a flexible, open mind, without clinging to that view as a dogmatic position. In this way, right view becomes a route to liberation rather than an obstacle. Direct realization of the Four Noble Truths may come at the peak level of self-development during the practice of right concentration.

===Right intention ===
Right intention ('''') can also be translated as "right thought", "right resolve", or "right aspiration" or "the exertion of our own will to change". In this factor, the practitioner should constantly aspire to rid themselves of whatever qualities that they know are wrong and immoral. Correct understanding of right view will help the practitioner to discern the differences between right intention and wrong intention. In the Pali Canon, it is explained as:
:"And what is right resolve? Being resolved on renunciation, on freedom from ill will, on harmlessness: This is called right resolve."<ref></ref> <ref></ref><ref></ref>
It means the renunciation of the worldly things and an accordant greater commitment to the spiritual path; good will; and a commitment to non-violence, or harmlessness, towards other living beings.

==Ethical conduct (''Śīla'' • ''Sīla'')==
In order for the mind to be unified in concentration, it is necessary to restrain from unwholesome deeds of body and speech to prevent the faculties of bodily action and speech from becoming tools of the defilements. Ethical conduct is used primarily as aids for mental purification. <ref></ref>

===Right speech ===
Right speech (''samyag-vāc'' • ''sammā-vācā''), deals with the way in which a Buddhist practitioner would best make use of their words.  In the Pali Canon, it is explained as:

:"And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, from divisive speech, from abusive speech, & from idle chatter: This is called right speech."<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
The ''Samaññaphala Sutta'', ''Kevatta Sutta''  and ''Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta'' elaborate:
:<div class="references-large">"Abandoning false speech...He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the world..."
:"Abandoning divisive speech...What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here...Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united, he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create concord..."
:"Abandoning abusive speech...He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that go to the heart, that are polite, appealing and pleasing to people at large..."
:"Abandoning idle chatter...He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, and the Vinaya. He speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed, connected with the goal..."<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref></div>
The ''Abhaya Sutta'' elaborate:
:<div class="references-large">“In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual, untrue, unbeneficial (or: not connected with the goal), unendearing & disagreeable to others, he does not say them.”
:"In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual, true, unbeneficial, unendearing & disagreeable to others, he does not say them."
:"In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual, true, beneficial, but unendearing & disagreeable to others, he has a sense of the proper time for saying them."
:"In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual, untrue, unbeneficial, but endearing & agreeable to others, he does not say them."
:"In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual, true, unbeneficial, but endearing & agreeable to others, he does not say them."
:"In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual, true, beneficial, and endearing & agreeable to others, he has a sense of the proper time for saying them. Why is that? Because the Tathagata has sympathy for living beings."<ref></ref></div>

===Right action === 
Right action (''samyak-karmānta'' • ''sammā-kammanta'') can also be translated as "right conduct" . In this factor, the practitioner  should train themselves to be morally upright in their activities, not acting in ways that would be corrupt or bring harm to themselves or others. In the Pali Canon, it is explained as:

:"And what is right action? Abstaining from taking life, from stealing, & from illicit sex (or sexual misconduct). This is called right action."<ref></ref><ref></ref>

:"And what, monks, is right action? Abstaining from taking life, abstaining from stealing, abstaining from unchastity: This, monks, is called right action." <ref></ref>

For the lay follower, the ''Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta'' elaborates:

:"And how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action? There is the case where a certain person, abandoning the taking of life, abstains from the taking of life. He dwells with his...knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. He does not take, in the manner of a thief, things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them. Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct. He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives, or their Dhamma; those with husbands, those who entail punishments, or even those crowned with flowers by another man. This is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily action." <ref></ref>

For the monastic, the ''Samaññaphala Sutta'' adds:
:"Abandoning uncelibacy, he lives a celibate life, aloof, refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way." <ref></ref><ref></ref>

===Right livelihood=== 
Right livelihood (''samyag-ājīva'' • ''sammā-ājīva'') . In this factor, the practitioners ought not to engage in trades or occupations which, either directly or indirectly, result in harm for other living beings. In the Pali Canon, it is explained as:

:"And what is right livelihood? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood: This is called right livelihood."<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

The five types of businesses that are harmful to anyone are:<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
# '''Business in weapons''' – trading in all kinds of weapons and instruments for killing. 
# '''Business in human beings''' – slave trading, or prostitution, or the buying and selling of children or adults
# '''Business in meat''' - "meat" refers to the bodies of beings after they are killed. Breeding animals for slaughter
# '''Business in intoxicants''' – manufacturing or selling intoxicating drinks, or addictive drugs.
# '''Business in poison''' - all kinds of toxic products designed to kill.

==Concentration (''Samādhi'')==
Samadhi is literally translated as "concentration", it is achieved through training in the higher consciousness, which brings the calm and collectedness needed to develop true wisdom by direct experience. <ref></ref>

'''八正道'''（はっしょうどう、aaryaaSTaaGgo-maargo、आर्याष्टाङ्गो मार्गो）は、釈迦が最初の説法において説いたとされる、涅槃に至る修行の基本となる、正見、正思惟、正語、正業、正命、正精進、正念および正定の、8種の徳。「八聖道」とも「八支正道」とも言うが、倶舎論では「八聖道支」としている。この 「道」が偏蛇を離れているので正道といい、聖者の「道」であるから聖道（aaryaamaarga）と言う。

== 概略 ==
八正道は四諦の中の道諦として説かれるから、教学的には四諦の教え以外に八正道が別にあるわけではない。四諦といえば、そこに道諦として八正道があるのだから別に、古来いわれるように四諦八正道と併称する必要はないが、このような総括がインドの様式のようである。

古い『相応部経典』では、釈迦は、その最初の説法（初転法輪）で、まず非苦非楽の中道を説き、それを八正道であるといい、さらに四諦を説いたといわれる。四諦を説いて、その道諦として八正道を説いたのでなく、中道とは八正道であることを説いて、ついで四諦を説いたのである。このことは、四諦という教義的組織は、八正道を中道と説く立場の教義的な裏づけであることを示している。釈迦の説法は、直接に人間の実践を主としており、教理は実践を体系付け裏付けるものである。釈尊の直接の教えからは程遠いとされる真言宗も、教相・事相の両立を説いている。われわれの仏教の理解も、書物による知識ではなく常に現実における実践を中心としなくてはならない。

== 正見 ==
「正しく眼の無常を観察すべし。かくの如く観ずるをば是を正見と名く。正しく観ずるが故に厭を生じ、厭を生ずるが故に喜を離れ、貪を離る。喜と貪とを離るるが故に、我は心が正しく解脱すと説くなり」といわれる。われわれが身心のいっさいについて無常の事実を知り、自分の心身を厭う思を起こし、心身のうえに起こす喜や貪の心を価値のないものと斥けることが「正見」（samyag-dRSTi, sammaa-diTTi）である。このように現実を厭うことが正見であるなら、人間の日常性を否定する消極的なもののように思われる。しかし、その日常性の否定は、真実を積極的に追求することから生まれるから、かえって真実の認識の完成である。この意味で「心解脱」といわれ、正見が「四諦の智」といわれる。

この正見は、以下の七種の正道によって実現される。その点で、八正道は、すべて正見である「智慧」の活動してゆく相である。
八正道は全て正見に納まる。

== 正思惟 ==
正思惟（samyak-saMkalpa, sammaa-saGkalpa）とは、出家を思惟し無瞋を思惟し、無害を思惟することである。このうち「出家を思惟する」とはパーリの原文では「ネッカンマ・サンカッパ」（nekkhamma saMkappa）であって、「nekkhamma」とは「否認」「否定」の意味だから、日常的なもののいっさいの否定をいう。財欲、色欲、飲食欲、名誉欲、睡眠欲等の「五欲」にまつわる、人間の日常生活の否定であり、それを思惟することが正思惟である。

この五欲の心の否定は、具体的には無瞋の思惟、無害の思惟である。いわば瞋恚の心や害心のすがたを、ありのままの姿で思惟し、これを捨てることを思惟するのである。自己本位にふるまう人間の行動や、独善的な人間の行為を、思惟によって明らかにして、これを否定するのである。

このように正思惟とは、自我的立場を否定して、無我こそ自己の真実であると見きわめることである。この立場の転換に人間生存の転換がなされる。しかし、それが「正思惟」である限り、このような生の転換も観念的である。そこで、次の「正語」と「正業」が説かれ、正思惟の中に示される行動への意志が実行されるのである。

== 正語 ==
正語（samyag-vaac, sammaa-vaacaa）とは、妄語を離れ、綺語を離れ、両舌を離れ、悪口を離れることである。

== 正業 ==
正業（samyak-kalmaanta, sammaa-kammanta）とは、殺生を離れ、不与取を離れ、愛欲を離れ、愛欲における邪行より離れることをいう。
この二つは正思惟されたものの実践である。妄語・綺語・悪口・両舌を離れること、これは人格の破壊を斥けるものであり、殺生・偸盗・邪婬を離れることは人間人格の尊重である。

== 正命 ==
正命（samyag-aajiiva, sammaa-aajiiva）
