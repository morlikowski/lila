'''Count Basie''' (õieti '''William James Basie'''; Hollywood, Florida osariik) oli USA džässpianist, -organist, -orkestrijuht ja -helilooja.

==Elulugu==

William James Basie sündis 21. augustil 1904 Red Bankis New Jersey osariigis. 1928. aastal liitus ta ansambliga Oklahoma City Blue Devils ('Oklahoma linna sinised kuradid') ning aasta hiljem sai ta Bennie Moteni ansambli pianistiks. Selles bändis olles sai ta endale nime "Count" Basie (krahv Basie). Aastal 1934 tegi Count Basie ka oma ansambli, kuid pidas paremaks minna ikkagi tagasi Moteni ansamblisse. Kui 1935. aastal Bennie Moten suri, lagunes ansambel laiali. Siis moodustas Count Basie uue ansambli, kutsudes sinna ka palju Moteni ansambli endisi liikmeid. Aastal 1936 kolis Count Basie koos ansambliga Kansas City'st New Yorki. Count Basie suri aastal 1984 Hollywoodis Florida osariigis, 79 aasta vanuselt.

Tema auks on nimetatud ka Count Basie teater tema sünnilinnas Red Bankis.

'''William "Count" Basie''' (American jazz pianist, tenor saxophonists Joe Williams. Basie's theme songs were "April In Paris".
==Biography==
=== Early life ===
William James Basie was born in Red Bank, New Jersey to Harvey Lee Basie and Lillian Ann Childs, who lived on Mechanic Street.<ref></ref> His father worked as a coachman and caretaker for a wealthy judge. After automobiles replaced horses, his father became a groundskeeper and handyman for several families in the area.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 26</ref> His mother took in laundry and baked cakes for sale and paid 25 cents a lesson for piano instruction for him.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 33</ref>

Basie was not much of a student and instead dreamed of a traveling life, inspired by the carnivals which came to town. He only got as far as junior high school.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 29</ref> He would hang out at the Palace theater in Red Bank and did occasional chores for the management, which got him free admission to the shows.  He also learned to operate the spotlights for the vaudeville shows. One day, when the pianist didn’t arrive by show time, Basie took his place. Playing by ear, he quickly learned to improvise music appropriate to silent movies.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 32</ref>

Though a natural at the piano, Basie preferred drums. However, the obvious talents of another young Red Bank drummer, Sonny Greer (who was Duke Ellington's drummer from 1919 to 1951), discouraged Basie and he switched to piano exclusively by age 15.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 33</ref> They played together in venues until Greer set out on his professional career. By then Basie was playing with pick up groups for dances, resorts, and amateur shows, including Harry Richardson’s “Kings of Syncopation”.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 33-34, plate 3</ref> When not playing a gig, he hung out at the local pool hall with other musicians where he picked up on upcoming play dates and gossip. He got some jobs in Asbury Park, playing at the Hongkong Inn, until a better player took his place.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 41</ref>

===Early career===
Around 1924, he went to Harlem, a hotbed of jazz, living down the block from the Alhambra Theater.  Early after his arrival, he bumped into Sonny Greer, who was then the drummer for the Washingtonians, Duke Ellington’s early band.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 51</ref> Soon, Basie met many of the Harlem musicians who were making the scene, including Willie “the Lion” Smith and James P. Johnson.

Basie toured in several acts between 1925 and 1927, including ''Katie Krippen and Her Kiddies'' as part of the ''Hippity Hop'' show, on the Keith, the Columbia Burlesque, and the Theater Owners Bookers Association (T.O.B.A.) vaudeville circuits, as a soloist and accompanist to blues singers Katie Krippen and Gonzelle White.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 55</ref><ref>Robinson, J. Bradford. ''Count Basie.'' in Kernfeld, Barry. ed. ''The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1.'' London: MacMillan, 2002. p. 155.</ref> His touring took him to Kansas City, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Chicago. Throughout his tours, Basie met many great jazz musicians, including Louis Armstrong.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 96</ref>

Back in Harlem in 1925, Basie got his first steady job at Leroy’s, a place known for its piano players and its “cutting contests”, The place catered to “uptown celebrities”, and typically the band winged every number without sheet music (using “head” arrangements).<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 68</ref> He met Fats Waller, who was playing organ at the Lincoln Theater accompanying silent movies, and Waller taught him how to play that instrument (Basie later played organ at the Eblon Theater in Kansas City).<ref> http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0821.html The New York Times</ref> As he did with Duke Ellington, Willie “the Lion” Smith helped Basie out during the lean times arranging gigs at house-rent parties, introducing him to other top musicians, and teaching him some piano technique.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 77</ref>

In 1928 Basie was in Tulsa and heard ''Walter Page and his Famous Blue Devils'', one of the first big bands, which featured Jimmy Rushing on vocals.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 6</ref> A few months later, he was invited to join the band, which played mostly in Texas and Oklahoma. It was at this time that he began to be known as "Count" Basie (see Jazz royalty).<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 20</ref>

===Kansas City years===
The following year, Basie became the pianist with the Bennie Moten band based in Kansas City, inspired by Moten’s ambition to raise his band to the level of Duke Ellington’s or Fletcher Henderson’s.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 116</ref> Where the Blue Devils were ”snappier” and more “bluesy”, the Moten band was classier and more respected, and played in the “Kansas City stomp” style.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 120</ref> In addition to playing piano, Basie was co-arranger with Eddie Durham, who actually did the notating.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, plate 10</ref> During a stay in Chicago, Basie recorded with the band. He occasionally played four-hand piano and dual pianos with Moten, who also conducted.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 122</ref> The band improved with several personnel changes, including the addition of sax man Ben Webster.

When the band voted Moten out, Basie took over for several months as ''Count Basie and his Cherry Blossoms'' until the band folded, when he returned to Moten's newly re-organized band.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 146</ref> When Moten died in 1935 after a surgical procedure, the band unsuccessfully attempted to stay together. Then Basie formed a new band, which included many Moten alumni, with the important addition of tenor saxophone player Lester Young. They played at the Reno Club and sometimes were broadcast on local radio. Late one night with time to fill, the band started improvising. Basie liked the results and named the piece "One O'Clock Jump".<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 67</ref> According to Basie, “we hit it with the rhythm section and went into the riffs, and the riffs just stuck.  We set the thing up front in D-flat, and then we just went on playing in F”. It became his signature tune.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 162</ref>

===Hammond and first recordings===

At the end of 1936, Basie and his band, now billed as ''Count Basie and His Barons of Rhythm'', moved from Kansas City and honed their repertoire at a long engagement at the Grand Terrace Ballroom in Chicago.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 171</ref> Right from the start, Basie’s band was noted for its rhythm section.  Another Basie innovation was the use of two tenor saxophone players; at the time, most bands had just one. When Lester Young complained of Herschel Evans' vibrato, the two were split apart and placed one on each side of the alto players, and soon Basie had the tenor players engaged in “duels”.  Many other bands later adapted the split tenor arrangement.<ref>Stanley Dance, ''The World of Count Basie'', Da Capo, New York, 1980, ISBN 0-306-80245-7, p. 68</ref>

In that city in October 1936, members of the band participated in a recording session which producer John Hammond later described as "the only perfect, completely perfect recording session I've ever had anything to do with".<ref> 1981 interview cited in "The Lester Young Story" (Properbox 16) p14-15</ref> Hammond, according to Basie, had heard Basie’s band over short-wave radio, then he went to Kansas City to check them out.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 165</ref> It was Lester Young’s earliest recordings.  Those four sides were released under the name Jones-Smith Incorporated because Basie had already signed with Decca Records but had not started recording for them (his first Decca session was January 1937). The sides included: "Shoe Shine Boy", "Evening", "Boogie Woogie", and "Oh, Lady Be Good".<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 181</ref>
 
By now, Basie's sound was characterized by his trademark "jumping" beat and the contrapuntal accents of his own piano.  His personnel around 1937 included: Lester Young and Herschel Evans (tenor sax), Freddie Green (guitar), Jo Jones (drums), Walter Page (bass), Earle Warren (alto sax), Buck Clayton and Harry Edison (trumpet), Benny Morton and Dickie Wells (trombone).<ref>Leonard Feather, ''The Encyclopedia of Jazz'', Bonanza Books, 1960, p.112</ref> Lester Young, known as “Prez” by the band, came up with nicknames for all the other band members. Basie became known as “Holy Man”, “Holy Main”, and just plain “Holy”.<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 104</ref>

Basie favored Joe Williams. He also hired arrangers who knew how to maximize the band's abilities, such as Eddie Durham and Jimmy Mundy.

=== New York City and the Swing years ===
When they arrived in New York, they made the Woodside Hotel their base (where they often rehearsed in the basement). Soon, they were booked at the famed Pennies from Heaven'' and ''Honeysuckle Rose''.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 186</ref>

Hammond introduced Basie to Billie Holiday and soon she sang with the band. (Holiday didn’t record with Basie, however, as she had her own record contract and preferred working with small combos).<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 200</ref> The band’s first appearance at the Apollo Theater followed, with vocalists Holiday and Rushing getting the most attention.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 190</ref> Eddie Durham came back to help with arranging and composing, but for the most part their numbers were worked out in rehearsal, with Basie guiding the proceedings, and the results written out little if at all. Once they found what they liked, they usually were able to repeat it using their collective memory.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 199</ref>

Next, Basie played at the Savoy, which was noted more for jitterbugging while the Roseland was more of a place for fox-trots and congas.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 202</ref> In early 1938, the Savoy was the meeting ground for a “battle of the bands” with Chick Webb’s group. Basie had Holiday and Webb countered with Ella Fitzgerald.  As ''Metronome'' magazine proclaimed, “Basie’s Brilliant Band Conquers Chick’s”, then it went on in detail, “Throughout the fight, which never let down in its intensity during the whole fray, Chick took the aggressive, with the Count playing along easily and, on the whole, more musically scientifically. Undismayed by Chick’s forceful drum beating, which sent the audience into shouts of encouragement and appreciation and casual beads of perspiration to drop from Chick’s brow onto the brass cymbals, the Count maintained an attitude of poise and self-assurance. He constantly parried Chick’s thundering haymakers with tantalizing runs and arpeggios which teased more and more force from his adversary”.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 208</ref> The publicity over the battle, before and after, gave the Basie band a big boost and they gained wider recognition, as evidenced by  Benny Goodman’s recording of ''One O’Clock Jump'' shortly thereafter.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 207</ref>

A few months later, Holiday left for Artie Shaw’s band, and was replaced by Helen Humes; she was also ushered in by John Hammond, and stayed with Basie for four years.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 211</ref> Co-arranger and trombone player Eddie Durham left for Glenn Miller’s orchestra and was replaced by Dicky Wells. Basie’s 14-man band began playing at the Famous Door, a mid-town nightspot, with a CBS network feed and air conditioning. Their fame took a huge leap.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 217-218</ref> Adding to their play book, Basie received arrangements from Jimmy Mundy (who had also worked with Benny Goodman and Earl Hines) particularly for "Cherokee", "Easy Does It", and "Super Chief".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 229</ref> In 1939, Basie and his band made a major cross-country tour, including their first West Coast dates. A few months later, Basie quit MCA and signed with the William Morris Agency, who got them better fees.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 247</ref>

In 1942, Basie moved to Queens with Catherine Morgan, after being married to her for a few years. On the West Coast, the band did a spot in ''Reveille With Beverly'', a Jerry Colonna, and singer swing began to fade, the pop singer was about to take hold.

===Post war and later years===
The big band era appeared to be over after the war, and Basie disbanded the group. For awhile, he performed in combos, sometimes stretched to an orchestra, until he re-formed his group as a 16-piece Mercury, Clef, and Verve labels.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 289-290</ref> The jukebox era had begun and Basie shared the exposure along with early rock'n'roll and rhythm and blues artists. Basie's new band was more of an ensemble group, with fewer solo turns, and relying less on “head” and more on written arrangements.

Basie added touches of bop “so long as it made sense”, and he required that “it all had to have feeling”. Basie’s band was sharing Birdland with bop greats Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Miles Davis. Behind the occasional bop solos, though, he always kept his strict rhythmic pulse, “so it doesn’t matter what they do up front; the audience gets the beat”.<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 5</ref>  Basie also added flute to some numbers, a novelty at the time that became widely copied.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 281, 304</ref> Soon, they were touring and recording again. The new band included: Paul Campbell, Tommy Turrentine, Johnny Letman, and Idris Sulieman (later Joe Newman) (trumpet); Jimmy Wilkins, Benny Powell, Matthew Gee (trombone); Paul Quinchette and Floyd Johnson (tenor sax); Marshall Royal and Ernie Wilkins (alto sax); and Charlie Fowlkes (baritone sax).<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 293</ref> Downbeat said, Basie “has managed to assemble an ensemble that can thrill both the listener who remembers 1938 and the youngster who has never before heard a big band like this”.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 299</ref>

In 1954, the band made its first European tour. Jazz was especially strong in France, Holland, and Germany in the 1950’s; These countries were the stomping grounds for many ex-patriate jazz stars who were either resurrecting their careers or sitting out the years of racial divide in the United States. Neal Hefti began to provide arrangements, notably "Li’l Darlin’". By the mid-1950s, Basie's band had become one of the pre-eminent backing big bands for some of the most prominent jazz vocalists of the time. They also toured with the “Birdland Stars of 1955”, whose lineup included Sarah Vaughan, Erroll Garner, Lester Young, George Shearing, and Stan Getz.<ref >Count Basie, 1985, p. 315</ref> 

In 1957, Basie released the live album ''At Newport''.  ''April in Paris'' (arrangement by Wild Bill Davis) was a best-selling instrumental and the title song for the hit album.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 318</ref> The Basie band made two tours in the British Isles and on the second, they put on a ”Command Performance” for Queen Elizabeth II, along with Judy Garland, Vera Lynn, and Mario Lanza.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 323</ref> In 1959, Basie’s band recorded a “greatest hits” double album ''The Count Basie Story'' (Frank Foster, arranger). Later that year, Basie appeared on a television special with Fred Astaire, featuring a dance solo to ''Sweet Georgia Brown'', followed in January 1960 by Basie performing at one of the five John F. Kennedy Inaugural Balls.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 335, 337</ref> That summer, Basie and Duke Ellington combined forces for the recording ''First Time! The Count Meets the Duke'', each providing four numbers from their play books.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 339</ref>

During the balance of the 1960s, the band kept busy with tours, recordings, television appearances, festivals, Las Vegas shows, and travel abroad, including cruises. Some time around 1964, Basie adopted his trademark yachting cap.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 353</ref>
Through steady changes in personnel, Basie led the band into the 1970s. Basie made a few more movie appearances, such as the April in Paris".

Basie died of pancreatic cancer in Hollywood, Florida on April 26, 1984 at the age of 79.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0821.html The New York Times</ref> Basie was a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity.

==The Singers==
Basie hitched his star to some of the most famous vocalists of the 1950’s and 1960’s, which helped keep the Big Band sound alive and added greatly to his recording catalog.  Joe Williams toured with the band and was featured on the 1957 album ''One O'Clock Jump'', and 1956's '' The Atomic Mr Basie)'', and Sammy Nestico ''(Basie-Straight Ahead)''.  

Sinatra-Basie'' and for a second studio album on 1964's ''National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The shows were taped for a BBC special, ''Sinatra: In Concert at The Royal Festival Hall''. Sinatra later said of this concert "I have a funny feeling that those two nights could have been my finest hour, really. It went so well; it was so thrilling and exciting".<ref name="CharlesPignon">Pignon, Charles (2004). ''The Sinatra Treasures,'' Virgin Books, ISBN 1852271841 </ref>

Basie also recorded with Tony Bennett in the early 1960s &mdash; their albums together included the live recording at Las Vegas and ''Strike Up the Band'', a studio album.  Basie also toured with Bennett, including a date at Carnegie Hall. Other notable recordings were with Sammy Davis, Jr., Bing Crosby, and Sarah Vaughn. One of Basie’s biggest regrets was never recording with Louis Armstrong, though they shared the same bill several times.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 362</ref>

==Legacy==

Count Basie introduced several generations of listeners to the Big Band sound and left an influential catalogue. Basie is remembered by many who worked for him as being considerate of musicians and their opinions, modest, relaxed, fun-loving, drily witty, and always enthusiastic about his music.<ref>Dance, 1980, pp. 7-8</ref> As he summed up the key to his understated style, in his autobiography, “I think the band can really ''swing'' when it swings ''easy'', when it can just play along like you are cutting butter”.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 370</ref>

Other cultural connections include Chairman of the Board'' album, as the basis for his own "Chairman of the Board" routine in the movie ''Canadian rock band Rush recorded a version of "One O'Clock Jump" with the Buddy Rich Big Band, and has used it at the end of his drum solos on the 2002 30th Anniversary Tour.

The Count Basie Theatre in his hometown of Red Bank, New Jersey was named in his honor.
