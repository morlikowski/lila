, also known as '''''Final Fantasy XI Online''''', is a Square (later Sony's Windows-based personal computers in November 2002. The PC version was released in North America on October 28, 2003, and the PlayStation 2 version on March 23, 2004. In Europe, only the Windows version was released, on September 17, 2004. An Xbox 360 version was released worldwide in April 2006 for all regions, as the system's first MMORPG and the first cross-platform MMORPG.<ref></ref> The Xbox 360 version does not require an Xbox Live Gold account.<ref></ref>

The story is set in the Vana'diel, where tasks can be performed to improve a character's powers or to complete quests. Players are able to customize a character that they will guide through the story. There are also hundreds of quests that allow players to gain various rewards, as well as a growing number of player versus player competitions.

In January 2004, Square Enix announced that more than 500,000 users, using more than one million characters, were playing the game. As of 2006, between 200,000 and 300,000 active players logged in per day, and the game remains the dominant MMORPG in Japan.<ref name="edge"></ref> Four expansions for the game have been released, capitalizing on the game's success.

==Gameplay==
''Final Fantasy XI'', in addition to being an MMORPG, differs from previous titles in the series in several ways.<ref></ref> Unlike the predefined main characters of previous ''Final Fantasy'' titles, players are able to customize their characters in limited ways, including race, gender, face, hair color, body size, job, and allegiance. Also corresponding to previous games in the series, all battles are real time, and enemies are no longer randomly encountered.<ref name="official"></ref>

There are 32 public game worlds, a cluster of servers, available for play with approximately 15,000 to 20,000 players in each.<ref name="xbox"/> The servers are named after summoned monsters from previous ''Final Fantasy'' titles, such as Diabolos. Players have the ability to move between servers, though few do; more common is the creation of different characters on different servers who can send items between each other.<ref></ref> There are no region-specific or system-specific servers, and unlike most online games, players of different languages play in the same world and can interact through automatic language translation from a library of translated phrases.<ref></ref>

===Interface===
Players have the option of using any combination of a keyboard, mouse, and controller to play ''Final Fantasy XI''. If a player using a PlayStation 2 or an Xbox 360 does not have a keyboard, the game provides a method for communication within the game. The heads-up display in ''Final Fantasy XI'' consists of a log window, menus, and several game information elements. The log window at the bottom of the screen displays system messages, battle messages, and text input by other players. Players may choose to filter what appears in the log window. "Menus" allow the player to access different commands, status windows, and configuration options. The "action command menu" appears just above the log window and gives the player several options to interact with the game world. Several menu options are available through the use of keyboard shortcuts, as well.<ref name="manual"></ref> Square Enix also allows players to communicate by text messaging with people playing the game online.<ref></ref>

===Basic gameplay===
Gameplay in ''Final Fantasy XI'' consists of two major components: missions, through which the main storyline of the game is told, and quests, which do not advance the main storyline, but fill out the game's fantasy world.<ref></ref> Missions are undertaken to advance in rank, access new areas, gain new privileges and advance the various storylines. Each nation and expansion has its own set of missions and quests, which a player must complete to advance in rank; a player may only complete missions for his home country. Quests may be undertaken for various rewards and fame. At release, over one hundred quests were available to play and new quests are added frequently.<ref name="IGNreview"></ref>

Battles in ''Final Fantasy XI'' take place in the same world in which players move around, unlike previous ''Final Fantasy'' games in which a battle would take place in a new screen. Monsters within the game operate under a system of "claim" and "enmity". A monster is "claimed" the moment a player performs any offensive action upon it, including physical or magical attacks or offensive job abilities. With some exceptions, once a monster is "claimed" it can only be attacked by players in the party or alliance of the player that claimed it. A monster will focus its attention on whomever has built up the most enmity. Players have several means at their disposal, from spells to abilities to items, to build up enmity and shed it to their advantage in battle. Players obtain in-game money known as gil by defeating a type of monster called Beastmen, though, unlike previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, this monster leaves only small amounts.

Unlike many MMORPGs, there is no way to attack other players. However, since 2004, several ways of competing with other players have been added. The system of player competition is known as "Conflict", and occurs only with the permission of both players.<ref></ref> The first form of competition was called "Ballista", in which players scored points by throwing rocks into a castle-like structure known as a "Rook".<ref></ref><ref></ref> In February 2006, a second form of competition was released called "Brenner", in which players steal the opposing team's flames and place them in a container on their own side. By maintaining these flames, points are awarded which determine the winner. New battle events have also been introduced including "Salvage", "Einherjar", and "Pankration".<ref></ref> Square Enix has also instituted a "marriage ceremony" for those who wish to do so (same-sex couplings are not permitted).<ref></ref>

===Job system===

''Final Fantasy XI'''s job system is largely adapted from ''Warrior, Monk, White Mage, Black Mage, Red Mage, and Thief. Upon achieving level 30 in any of these jobs, a player may opt to complete quests to unlock the jobs of Paladin, Dark Knight, Beastmaster, Ranger, Bard, Summoner, Samurai, Ninja, Dragoon, Blue Mage, Corsair, Puppetmaster, Dancer, and Scholar.

===Crafting and hobbies===
In addition to completing quests and missions, players can participate in several side-mog house" as it is known in the game.<ref></ref> The raising and breeding of Chocobos was a long-requested activity enabled in the summer 2006 update.<ref></ref> Chocobo racing began in March 2007, which allowed for the racing of player-raised Chocobos against non-player characters (NPCs). Winning racers can earn "Chocobucks", which can be used to buy, for example, items that assist Chocobo breeding.<ref></ref>

An important part of the game is the accumulation of items, especially rare ones, which allow players to create powerful spells and weapons. There are many ways to obtain items, such as harvesting, excavating, logging, mining, defeating monsters, and digging by using Chocobos. Square Enix attempted to increase the opportunity for players to find rare items in order to equalize the game and stop the practice of "gil selling", or exchanging real money for in-game items.<ref></ref> There had been an item auction system that was shut down due to some players exploiting the system.<ref></ref> Items can be created by combining elemental crystals obtained by fighting monsters with other items in a process called "synthesis".<ref></ref>. Recipe results can vary widely based on the player's skill and the quality of the player's items.

===Game economy===
''Final Fantasy XI'' has a largely player-based economy, with a heavy reliance on "Auction Houses" in each of the major cities of Vana'diel. There are certain economic controls in place mainly in the form of fees and taxes, including a percentage tax on items purchased and a fee for putting items up for auction.  Transportation, auction house, item storage, and tax fees do not go to players; these gil sinks effectively remove money from the economy to prevent inflation.

Square Enix has stated that the trade of items for real currency is officially a violation of the Terms of Service for ''Final Fantasy XI''.<ref></ref> In early 2006, Square Enix discovered that a group of players had found a way to generate game currency and exchange it for real currency, which, in turn, drove up prices for all items across the game. In response, 700 accounts were permanently banned and 300&nbsp;billion gil was removed from circulation.<ref></ref> In July 2006, Square Enix banned or suspended over 8,000 other accounts for similar manipulation and commerce.<ref></ref> Since 2006, Square Enix has regularly banned accounts found to be in violation of the terms, some of them using third-party tools, effectively removing billions of gil from the in-game economy.

==Plot==
===Setting===
The world of ''Final Fantasy XI'' is known as Vana'diel. It consists of two main landmasses with two smaller islands flanking them, which in turn are surrounded by small islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the northern glaciers to the southern deserts.<ref></ref> The four main cities in Vana'diel are Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno. The expansion ''Treasures of Aht Urhgan'' added the large Aht Urhgan Whitegate/Al Zahbi city area. The rest of Vana'diel is made up of a number of outdoor, dungeon, and minor town areas split into various regions. While most areas are accessible by walking, various modes of transportation, ranging from the classic ''Final Fantasy'' airships to special spells, facilitate movement across the game world.

The events of the game are set 20 years after the Crystal War, when the nations of San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst on the main continent of ''Vana'diel'' fought and defeated the Shadow Lord and his army of beastmen. A Diabolos.

===Characters===
The five playable races in ''Final Fantasy XI'' are Elvaan - strong ''Final Fantasy'' monsters, including races such as the Goblin, Orc, Yagudo, and Quadav. Some of these creatures follow the Shadow Lord, a source of the game's conflict.<ref></ref>

===Story===
Players begin the game as residents of one of these three main countries, San d'Oria, Bastok and Windurst, and must help band the nations together against the resurrected Shadow Lord.

The expansion ''Rise of the Zilart'' reveals that the Crystal War and the resurrection of the Shadow Lord had been masterminded by the Zilart princes Eald'Narche and Kam'lanaut, who survived the extinction of their race. The two Zilarts plan to become Gods by opening the path to paradise, and the player is charged with thwarting their plans.

''Chains of Promathia'' revolves around the dead Twilight God Promathia, who had originally cursed the Zilart race, and the attempts of various factions to either complete or stop his resurrection. The wyrmking Bahamut is involved in these events, and intends to destroy Vana'diel to prevent Promathia from absorbing the life of the world.
