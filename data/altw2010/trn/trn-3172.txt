'''''Dennis the Menace''''', known in some countries as just "''''Dennis''''"is a daily syndicated newspaper comic strip originally created, written and illustrated by the late Hank Ketcham since March 12, 1951, which made its debut in only 16 newspapers. It is now written and drawn by Ketcham's former assistants, Marcus Hamilton and Ron Ferdinand, and distributed to more than at least 1,000 newspapers in 48 countries and 19 languages by King Features Syndicate.<ref>{{cite news

Dennis was so successful that he was later made into many kinds of popular media, including a 1960s live-action television sitcom, a 1980s animated television series, a 1987 made-for-TV live-action movie, a 1993 theatrical live-action film and another animated series based on that film, and there is also a 1981 animated prime-time television special, a 1998 direct-to-video live-action sequel that followed the 1993 live-action film and a 2002 animated television movie, and a 2007 Christmas special film, with a 2008 Halloween special film in already in development.

==Characters==
*Dennis Mitchell - a bumbling but lovable blond-haired, angel-faced little devil, five-year-old boy with a penchant for mischief.  Everywhere he goes, Dennis's wide-eyed curiosity, well-meaning attempts to help out and his youthful nature always seem to lead to trouble.
*George Everett Wilson - a retired postal carrier, Dennis's next-door neighbor. Dennis worships Mr. Wilson but often annoys him as he regularly disrupts Mr. Wilson's attempts at a serene, quiet life-such as cultivating roses.  As a result, the gruff old man overtly displays a less-than-cordial attitude towards the young boy, though Dennis continues his well-meaning intrusions unabated.
*Martha Wilson - Mr. Wilson's engaging wife, Martha, coddles Mr. Wilson, adores Dennis and sees him as a surrogate grandson, since the Wilsons never had any children.
*Henry Mitchell & Alice Mitchell - Dennis's father, an aerospace engineer and Dennis's stay-at-home mother. His long-suffering parents can only shake their heads and try to explain their son's antics to others. Despite this, and the many times his mother sends Dennis to the corner chair, they really do love him very much.  Henry seems to understand Dennis a lot more in affairs of the heart.  One example was when a furious Dennis stormed in saying,''"Wimmin can say some of the stupidest things!"'' and his father knowingly said to his wife, ''Margaret''.  Another time was when Dennis and Gina were having a fun time together, and his mother wondered if Dennis would realize that he really likes Gina, and his father said knowingly again, ''"I think he will"''. His mother, however, is usually the shelter where Dennis can run to when things get too overwhelming for him; and she is there with a warm hug and protection. Interestingly ''Henry Mitchell'' is similar to Hank Ketcham-being a former US Navy man and resembling Ketchum as Ketchum appeared in the 1950's! As a running gag Alice Mitchell has a phobia about snakes.
*Ruff - Dennis's faithful dog. Ruff is always eagerly following him around, accompanying him running, riding his bike or his skateboard.
*Joey McDonald - Dennis's friend, loyal and not-too-bright, he usually plays the sidekick to Dennis. Also he appeared in Colton Parrot. 
*Margaret Wade - Dennis's friend and somewhat arch-foil; red-haired glasses wearing know-it-all whose cloying and self-important demeanor is always getting on Dennis’s nerves.  She is attracted to Dennis, but he will have none of it.  She always tries to improve Dennis and his manners, but only succeeds in annoying him.  She has a certain amount of dislike for Gina, whom she sees as her competition. Gina gains Dennis's respect and admiration by just being herself and Margaret's pretensions fail to even make a mark on him.
*Gina Gillotti - Dennis's friend, a tomboy. She is a fiercely independent young Italian girl, whom Dennis secretly has a crush on.  He likes her because she is as independent minded as he is; and she enjoys the same things that he does. Gina is also highly aware that she is a girl, and woe betide anyone who doesn't think so.  This earns her Dennis' respect and admiration. 
*Grampa Johnson, Alice's father who spoils Dennis often. He evokes the unintentional jealousy of Mr. Wilson, for he gets to see him only on occasion, but Wilson sees him all the time. Because they are so much alike, Dennis and Grampa Johnson get along beautifully.  Wilson also thinks that Johnson should act his age, but this advice is often ignored. To Grampa, life is worth living, and he encourages Dennis to live it to the full.  
*Hot Dog - Dennis's rarely-seen cat who usually commiserates with him whilst he sits in the corner and reflects on his sins.  

In tone, Dennis is most like an escapee from a 1930s movie, such as an ''Our Gang'' film, and can be seen as a derivative of another mischievous comic strip creation, The Katzenjammer Kids.  Dennis the Menace also serves as a prototype for other cartoon troublemakers, such as Calvin (from ''Calvin and Hobbes''),Bart Simpson, Little Lulu, Buster Brown and Curious George.

==History==

===Inspiration===
The inspiration for the comic strip came from Dennis Ketcham, the real life son of Hank Ketcham,<ref>{{cite news

  }}</ref> who was only 4 years old when he refused to take a nap and somehow messed up his whole room. Hank tried many possible kid names for the character he was drawing in his desktop in his home at Carmel, and translated them into some his rough pencil sketches, but they seem unsuitable for a character of such immense depiction, until his studio door flew open and his then-wife Alice, in utter exasperation, exclaimed, "Your son is a menace!"  Thus the "Dennis the Menace" name was used, the "menace" epithet and the image of the tornado stuck. The character of Henry Mitchell even bore a striking resemblance to Ketcham himself, who also became a fixture in the strip. Many people  feel the characters hold remarkable resemblance to Jamie and the Magic Torch.

According to Hank Ketcham's biography in the Wichita, Kansas.

===Debut===
Dennis the Menace comic strip made its debut on March 12, 1951,<ref>[http://www.dennisthemenace.com/ Dennis the Menace Website]</ref> in the following year in 16 newspapers across the US for the first time.

Coincidentally, another cartoon strip titled Dennis the menace was published in the British comic The Beano on March 15 (cover dated March 17 - the "off sale" date) of the same year.. Like the American character, the UK one remains popular to this day and has made the transition to television cartoons. As a result, any product of the US character, including the TV series, was billed simply as "Dennis" in the UK.

===Award===
Ketcham received the Reuben Award for the strip in 1953.<ref>{{cite web

== Comic book ==

Dennis had been produced in comic book format for many years. The first issue of ''Dennis the Menace'' was published in August, 1953 by Standand/Pines, the original series ran for a total of 155 issues until January, 1978. Meanwhile, Fawcett Comics purchased the half of the comic book rights to the character and Dennis made his only return to the comics after Fawcett lost the Captain Marvel lawsuit in 1958. At that point, Fawcett Comics and Hallden Publishing became a subsidiary of CBS Consumer Publishing (A publishing imprint of CBS Corporation) and the ''Dennis the Menace'' comic book title became ''The Dennis the Menace Fun Fest'' series, the comic books continued through the issue #166, published in November, 1979.
=== Specials series ===
The comic book series (Drawn by Ketcham's assistant Al Wiseman, until the mid 60s) was running in tandem with the “Specials” series. First, there was ''The Dennis the Menace Winter Special'', then ''The Dennis the Menace Spring Special'', ''The Dennis the Menace Summer Special'' and then finally ''The Dennis the Menace Christmas Special''.
To continue this tandem, Fawcett published an anthology series of his previous adventures called ''The Best of Dennis the Menace'', which ran from 1959 to 1961 in a total of 5 issues. This was followed with ''The Giant Dennis the Menace'' series, and concluded the specials series with their most-famous of their ''Dennis the Menace'' titles, ''The Dennis the Menace Travel Special'' Series. These Travel issues included Dennis and his family going to places like Mexico or camp in Yosemite Park and the most popular issue ''"Dennis Goes To Hollywood"'' which has him wreaking havoc on various movie sets and encountering assorted movie stars. 

The specials series was then later re-christened as the ''Dennis the Menace Bonus Magazine Series'' forerunners, the series, which bore the title ''Bonus Magazine'', started with issue #78 in March 1970 and continued through issue #173 in February 1978. CBS and Hallden later retitled the series as ''The Dennis the Menace Big Bonus Series'', which it ran through issue #194 in October 1979.

=== Other series ===
By October 1979, Fawcett began publishing a separate series of 36 issues entitled ''Dennis the Menace and Mr. Wilson'', which involved the simple adventures of Dennis and Mr. Wilson going into all sorts of mischievous capers. By the second issue, the ''Dennis and Mr. Wilson'' series was re-christened as ''Dennis the Menace and His Friends'' which now involved the adventures of Dennis, Mr. Wilson and friends, Joey, Margaret and dog, Ruff going to cause more troublesome mishaps. Because of this, the Mr. Wilson stories were alternated with the three characters as ''Ruff, Joey and Margaret'' who each shared a #1 issue with Dennis. 

There were also other series of Dennis the Menace comic books published in 1961, first there was ''Dennis the Menace and His Dog, Ruff'' and ''Dennis the Menace and His Pal, Joey'' published the summer and the last but not least was ''Dennis the Menace and Margaret'' published in the winter of 1969.

=== Bible kids series ===
In 1977, Word Books, Inc. commissioned Hank Ketcham Enterprises, Inc. to produce a series of ten comic books under the title of ''Dennis and the Bible Kids'', with the usual cast of characters reading (and sometimes partly acting out) the stories of Joseph, Moses, David, Esther, Jesus, and other Biblical characters. These were sold through Christian bookstores and related outlets. Each issue contained several inspirational renderings by Hank Ketcham himself.
=== Marvel series ===
For some unknown reason, the ''Dennis the Menace Fun Fest'' and the ''Dennis the Menace Big Bonus Series'' were revived for a short issue run in 1980. The numbering system was even more of a mystery.

*January: ''The Dennis the Menace Fun Fest'' #16
*February: ''The Dennis the Menace Big Bonus'' #10
*March: ''The Dennis the Menace Fun Fest'' #17
*April: ''The Dennis the Menace Big Bonus'' #11
