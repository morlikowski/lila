'''SpVggグロイター・フュルト'''（'''SpVgg Greuther Fürth'''）はドイツ・バイエルン州・フュルトのサッカークラブチーム。第二次世界大戦前には三度の優勝を果たした古豪だが、ブンデスリーガ発足後はもっぱらブンデスリーガ2部かレギオナルリーガに所属している。ユニフォームは緑と白で、スコットランドの名門、セルティックなどと類似したデザイン。すぐ近くにニュルンベルクがあるため、1.FCニュルンベルクとはライヴァル関係にある。

==クラブの歴史==
1903年に発足した。陸上、水泳、テニス、ハンドボールなどの部門も創設され、総合スポーツクラブとして発展した。1914年、1926年、1929年にはリーグ優勝を果たしている。ブンデスリーガ発足後は、長くブンデスリーガ2部に在籍した。しかし、1982年から1983年のリーグ最終戦で逆転降格が決定し、3部リーグへと降格した。その後クラブの低迷は続くが、1996年から1997年のシーズンにレギオナルリーガ（3部）準優勝を果たし、ブンデスリーガ2部へ昇格した。

2006年-2007年シーズンは最終節までわずかではあるが昇格の可能性を残していたが、カールスルーエSCに1-3で破れ、5位に終わった。

'''SpVgg Greuther Fürth''' is a German football club based in Fürth, Bavaria. The current club was formed only very recently out of the 1 July 1996 merger of traditional side ''Spielvereinigung Fürth'' and the senior football side of newcomer ''Turn- und Sportverein Vestenbergsgreuth''.

__TOC__
==History==
===Spielvereinigung Fürth===
The origins of ''SpVgg Fürth'' are in the establishment on 23 September 1903 of a football department within the gymnastics club ''Turnverein 1860 Fürth''. The footballers went their own way as an independent club in November 1906. The team played in the Ostkreisliga and took divisional titles there in 1912, 1913, and 1914 before moving on to participate in the Süddeutscher (en:South German) regional playoffs for the national championship round.<ref>Grüne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag ISBN 3-89784-147-9</ref>

====National champions====
''Fürth'' won their first national title in 1914 under English coach Nuremberg'' in 1920. ''Nuremberg'' was the dominant side of the decade and a bitter rivallry developed between the two clubs. A star player with ''SpVgg'' was forced to leave after he married a Nuremberg girl. In 1924, for the first and only time, the German national side was made up exclusively of players from just two sides – ''Fürth'' and ''Nuremberg'' - and players of the two teams slept in separate rail coaches. 

''SpVgg'' showed regularly on the national stage, advancing to the semi-finals in 1923 and 1931. They claimed two more championships – in 1926 and 1929 – with both of those victories coming at the expense of ''Hertha BSC Berlin''. Through this period the club played five finals in the Süddeutschpokal (en:South German Cup), coming away as cupwinners on four occasions. On 27 August 1929 the association was joined by ''FC Schneidig Fürth''.

German football was re-organized in 1933 under the Gauligen. ''Fürth'' became part of the Gauliga Bayern, but their success over the next dozen seasons was limited to a division title there in 1935, alongside regular appearances in competition for the Tschammerpokal, predecessor to today's DFB Pokal (en:German Cup).

====Postwar play====
After the war the team struggled through three seasons in the Oberliga Süd (I) before slipping to the Amateurliga Bayern (II). ''SpVgg'' quickly recovered itself and returned to Oberliga play the next season. They won the title there in 1950 and went on to the national playoffs, advancing as far as the semifinals before being eliminated 1:4 by ''Bundesliga in 1963.

The club did not qualify as one of the sixteen teams that made up the new unified national first division and found themselves playing second division football in the Regionalliga Süd, where the were generally a mid-table side whose best finish was third place result in 1967. The club played in the 2.Bundesliga from its inception in 1974 until 1983 with their best performance a fourth place finish in 1978-79. They slipped to playing in the tier III Oberliga Bayern, with a short three-year spell in the fourth division Landesliga Bayern-Mitte in the late 80s.  In 1990, ''Fürth'' celebrated a 3:1 victory in the opening round of German Cup play over first division side ''Borussia Dortmund'' before going out 0:1 to ''1. FC Saarbrücken'' in the second round. They returned to the Amateur Oberliga Bayern (IV) in 1991 and the Regionalliga Süd (III) in 1994.

===TSV Vestenbergsgreuth===
Meanwhile, the small village team of ''TSV Vestenbergsgreuth'' was established 1 February 1974 and made its appearance as a fourth division side.<ref>Grüne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag ISBN 3-89784-147-9</ref> They made their move up into the Amateur Oberliga Bayern (III) in 1987, just as ''Fürth'' was making its way down to play in the division the more junior club had just escaped. ''TSV'' took part in the national amateur playoff round in 1988 and 1995. Their best performance came in the 1995 DFB Pokal (en:German Cup) when they upset ''Bayern Munich'' 1:0, and then beat ''FC Homburg'' 5:1, before being eliminated in the third round of the competition by ''VfL Wolfsburg'' on penalty kicks.

===SpVgg Greuther Fürth===
At the time of their merger in 1996, in which ''TSV'''s football players came over to ''Fürth'', both clubs were playing at about the same level in Regionalliga Süd (III). The new club was runner-up in the division the next year, and so earned promotion to the 2.Bundesliga, where they have consistently finished in the top half of the eighteen team table. ''Fürth'' has come close to renewing its ancient rivallry with ''Nuremberg'', narrowly missing promotion in each of the last two seasons.

===SpVgg Greuther Fürth II===
''Fürth'' also fields a strong reserve side which has played in the Oberliga Bayern (IV) since the 2001-02 season and finished second there in 2006-07. A second place in 2007-08 meant the team was qualified to play in the ''Regionalliga Süd'' in 2008-09.

==Rivals==
:See also:''Bavarian football derbys''
The 1. FC Nuremberg is by far the ''SpVgg's'' biggest rival, going back to the early days of German football when, at times, those two clubs dominated the national championship. Both clubs will be playing together in the 2nd Bundesliga in 2008-09.
