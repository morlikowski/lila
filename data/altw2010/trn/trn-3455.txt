'''''Macadam à deux voies''''' (''Two-Lane Blacktop'') est un road movie réalisé par Monte Hellman en 1971.

Passé inaperçu lors de sa sortie initiale, le film est aujourd'hui culte. Représentant une capsule temporelle de la mythique Route 66 on l'associe souvent à des films de la même période où l'on peut déceler un message existentialiste tels que ''Point limite zéro'', ''Easy Rider'' ou ''Electra Glide in Blue''

ISBN 0-517-20185-2</ref> Brock Yates, organizer of the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash (better known as the Cannonball Run) cites ''Two-Lane Blacktop'' as one source of inspiration for the creation of the race, and commented on it in his ''Car and Driver'' column announcing the first Cannonball.

''Two-Lane Blacktop'' is notable as a time capsule film of U.S. Route 66 during the pre-Interstate Highway era, and for its stark footage and minimal dialogue. As such it has become popular with fans of Route 66. ''Two-Lane Blacktop'' has been compared to similar road movies with an existentialist message from the era, such as ''Vanishing Point'', ''Easy Rider'', and ''Electra Glide in Blue''.

==Plot==
The premise involves two 1955 Chevy (sometimes identified as a Chevrolet Bel Air) and drift from town to town, making their only income challenging local residents to races.  The movie follows them driving east on Route 66 from Needles, California. They pick up a hitchhiker in Flagstaff, Arizona (played by Bird). In New Mexico, they encounter another drag racing drifter (played by Oates, driving an "Orbit Orange" 1970 Pontiac GTO  Judge) and challenge him to a cross-country race to Washington, D.C., with the winner of the race getting the title to the others' car. The characters are never identified by name in the movie, given only names such as "The Driver," "The Mechanic," "GTO," and "The Girl". The movie follows the group east through small towns in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Tennessee; however, they never make it to Washington, D.C. 

After sleeping with both the Driver and the Mechanic during the winding course of the journey, The Girl disappoints both the Driver and the Mechanic when she abruptly leaves with the GTO while they are competing at a local racetrack in Arkansas. The Driver pursues them intently, finding them at a diner where the Girl has just rejected the GTO's idea to visit Chicago. The Driver proposes going to Columbus, Ohio to pick up some parts, but the Girl immediately rejects him. She hops on the back of a long-haired stranger's motorcycle, dropping her bag in the parking lot. The three men abruptly depart from the diner in their respective cars. The driver of the GTO, who tells a different story about himself to each of the many hitchhikers he picks up, stops for a final pair of soldiers. The GTO driver tells his passengers that he had won the car while driving a home-built '55 Chevy, emphasizing the circular theme of the film. The film ends during a drag race at an airstrip in East Tennessee. The sound drops out, then the film seems to slow until it freezes frame, and begins to burn the film within the projector.

==Production==
Will Corry's script was bought by producer Michael Laughlin and he asked Hellman to direct it. The filmmaker liked the basic idea but agreed to make the film only if another screenwriter was hired to rewrite the script. Laughlin agreed and they hired Rudy Wurlitzer.<ref name= "Savlov"/> Hellman and Wurlitzer worked closely on the script. Hellman saw a picture of James Taylor on a billboard on the Sunset Strip and asked the musician to come and do a screen test. Dennis Wilson was the last actor cast.<ref name= "Savlov"/>

This film was considered a low budget film at the time of its production. It only cost an estimated US$850&nbsp;000 to complete. A ''Rolling Stone'' article written on location a full year before the film's release proclaimed the film an "instant classic" about "road racers and their women, cross-country adventure, the Great God Speed."<ref name= "Webb">{{cite news

==Soundtrack==
Unlike other Existential road movies of the time (such as ''"Easy Rider"'', and ''"Vanishing Point"''), ''Two-Lane Blacktop'' does not rely heavily on music, nor was a soundtrack album released. The music featured in the film covers many genres, including Rock, Folk, Blues, Country, Bluegrass, and R&B. Interestingly enough, the two stars of the film, James Taylor and Dennis Wilson, did not contribute any music.
