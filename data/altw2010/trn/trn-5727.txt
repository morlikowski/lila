'''ラヌッチョ2世・ファルネーゼ''' （'''Ranuccio II Farnese''', パルマ及びピアチェンツァ公（在位：1646年 - 1694年）。 

第5代パルマ公オドアルド1世と妃マルゲリータ・デ・メディチの長男として生まれた。父の死後2年間、叔父フランチェスコ・マリーア・ファルネーゼと母の2人が摂政をつとめた。

オドアルドの治世の間、パルマはウルバヌス8世の属するバルベリーニ家が得ようとしたローマ北部の教皇領を獲得した。

1649年、ウルバヌスの後継インノケンティウス10世は、ラヌッチョ2世をクリストフォロ・ジアルダ枢機卿殺害犯として告発した。その報復に、教皇軍はファルネーゼ家の都市を2ヶ月にわたって包囲し破壊し尽くした。8月にパルマ軍はボローニャから遠くない地点で鎮圧した。彼は金で買い戻そうとしたが、教皇領はパルマに残らなかった。

彼の治世の晩年、パルマは、神聖ローマ帝国軍のひどい駐留に苦しめられ、ヴィットーリオ・アメデーオ2世とフランスの間で論争となった。

During Odoardo's reign the decling Duchy had been involved in the Wars of Castro, connected to a Farnese fief in the Papal States, north to Rome, which the powerful Pope Urban VIII's family, the Barberini, was eager to acquire.  

In Cardinal Cristoforo Giarda, who was on his way to the city of Castro (of which he had been named bishop) at the time of his death.  In retaliation, forces loyal to the Pope besieged the Farnese city for two months, and then razed it to the ground. In August of that same year the Parmense troops had been crushed not far from Bologna, and Ranuccio remained with no means to gain back its fief, despite his attempts to buy it back through money.
