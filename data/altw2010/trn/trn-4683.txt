'''Typhoon Pongsona''' (international designation: ''0226'', JTWC designation: ''31W'') was the last typhoon of the Pacific tropical cyclone list and is the Korean name for the garden balsam.<ref name="gp"/> Pongsona developed out of an area of disturbed weather on km/h (110&nbsp;mph <small>10-min</small>). It ultimately turned to the northeast, weakened, and became extratropical on December 11.

Typhoon Pongsona produced strong wind gusts peaking at 278&nbsp;km/h (173&nbsp;mph <small>1-min</small>), which left the entire island of USD, $800&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD), making Pongsona among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon also caused heavy damage on Rota and elsewhere in the Northern Marianas Islands, and as a result of its impact the name was retired.

==Storm history==

During late November, an area of mi) east-southeast of trough was located near the surface.<ref name="1130stwa"></ref> With beneficial outflow aloft, the disturbance developed rainbands as deep convection increased near its mid-level circulation.<ref name="1130stwa2"></ref> A low-level circulation formed on December 1, which was initially weak, elongated, and slightly removed from the deep convection.<ref name="1202stwa"></ref> Weak to moderate vertical wind shear allowed the low-level circulation center to consolidate near its cycling convection.<ref name="1202stwa2"></ref> Based on its organization, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system a tropical depression at 0600&nbsp;UTC on December 2 while it was located 735&nbsp;km (450&nbsp;mi) east-northeast of Pohnpei.<ref name="jmasum"></ref> Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert,<ref name="1202stwa2"/> and at 1800&nbsp;UTC on December 2 the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 31W.<ref name="td31w1"></ref>

Upon first becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression tracked northwestward, and in the hours after being classified the circulation became exposed to the east of the deepest convection<ref name="disc2"></ref> due to wind shear.<ref name="ts31w2"></ref> The JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status early on ridge, Pongsona turned westward and gradually intensified.<ref name="prog1"></ref> On eyewall; both the JTWC<ref name="disc11"></ref> and the JMA upgraded Pongsona to a typhoon while centered about 1150&nbsp;km (715&nbsp;mi) southeast of Guam.<ref name="jmasum"/>

A developing baroclinic system to the east of supertyphoon, its peak intensity. At 0500&nbsp;UTC on December 8 the eyewall made landfall on Guam.<ref name="disc23"></ref> Shortly thereafter, the JMA estimated Pongsona attained a peak intensity of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph <small>10-min winds</small>) just to the north of Guam.<ref name="jmasum"/> The typhoon turned to the north-northwest through a weakness in the subtropical ridge a short distance west of the Northern Marianas Islands. On December 9, convection began to weaken as Pongsona began interacting with a mid-latitude system to its north.<ref name="prog3"></ref> Dry air became entrained in the north and western portion of the circulation;<ref name="prog4"></ref> the eyewall steadily deteriorated, and the low-level circulation became exposed to the west of the diminishing convection.<ref name="prog4"></ref> As a result, both the JTWC and the JMA declared Pongsona as an extratropical cyclone on December 11 about 1400&nbsp;km (865&nbsp;mi) northwest of Wake Island.<ref name="gp"/>

===Differences among warning centers===
The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 10-minute sustained winds, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses 1-minute sustained winds. The conversion factor between the two is 1.14.<ref name="windchange"></ref> JMA's peak intensity for Pongsona was 170&nbsp;km/h (105&nbsp;mph) 10-minute sustained, or 195&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph) 1-minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Pongsona was 240&nbsp;km/h (150&nbsp;mph) 1-minute sustained, or 210&nbsp;km/h (130&nbsp;mph) 10-minute sustained. The National Meteorological Center of China estimated a peak intensity of 185&nbsp;km/h (115&nbsp;mph) 10-minute sustained, or 210&nbsp;km/h (135&nbsp;mph) 1-minute sustained.<ref name="gp"></ref>

== Preparations ==
The tropical storm watch for the Rota, Saipan, and Tinian, which was upgraded to a typhoon warning about 23&nbsp;hours prior to the onset of typhoon-force winds; typhoon warnings were also issued for the unpopulated island of Agrihan. By one day before the typhoon moved through the Mariana Islands, local weather offices predicted Pongsona to pass well east of the area. Despite a more westward track than anticipated, forecasts remained stagnant until the morning of December 8, when two lead forecasters reluctantly predicted much greater threat to the Mariana Islands. As a result, many citizens felt they were unprepared and insufficiently warned for the typhoon.<Ref name="nws"/>

Nine shelters throughout the Northern Mariana Islands were opened to accommodate families needing assistance. Several schools opened classrooms as evacuation centers.<ref name="saipantribune"></ref> On Guam, ten schools were used as shelters,<ref name="kuam"></ref> and on the day of impact 2,271&nbsp;people were in shelters. On Rota, 159&nbsp;people sought shelter, and in Saipan, 549 were in shelters by the day of impact.<ref name="ncdc"></ref> The Guam Memorial Hospital officials advised all pregnant mothers within 32&nbsp;weeks of their delivery date to check in. The Guam Office of Civil Defense filed the paperwork for the Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez took similar measures to declare a state of emergency for the area.<ref name="kuam"/> Following experience from previous typhoons, Guam newspaper Pacific Daily News underwent preparations to provide internet updates for the storm, including reinforcing the building, maintaining sufficient food supplies for the staff, and stationing two reporters elsewhere on the island; the paper was the only immediate source of information about the typhoon outside of Guam.<ref name="pdn"></ref>

==Impact==
===Federal States of Micronesia===
Early in its duration, Pongsona first affected Pohnpei as a tropical storm. There, it produced heavy rains and gusty winds, though little damage was reported. Later, it brought tropical storm force winds to Chuuk. High waves from the storm washed over and covered some atolls.<ref name="nws"/>

===Guam===
thumb|250px|Damage from Pongsona on Guam
Typhoon Pongsona maintained a 65&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi) wide eye upon crossing the northern, populated portion of the island of millibars (27.61&nbsp;inHg), making Pongsona the third most intense typhoon to strike Guam; it is behind only a typhoon in 1900 (926&nbsp;mbar, 27.34&nbsp;inHg) and Typhoon Karen of 1962 (932&nbsp;mbar, 27.52&nbsp;inHg).<ref name="nws"/>

Communications on the island failed due to the winds;<ref name="nws"/> the entire island was left without power and phone service.<ref name="femupdate"></ref> The winds greatly damaged 715&nbsp;power poles and 513&nbsp;transformers, leaving about $52&nbsp;million in electrical damage reported (2002&nbsp;USD, $59&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD).<ref name="ncdc"/> The local weather office's communication link was cut off after flooding damaged a telecommunication facility, causing the National Weather Service in Honolulu, Hawaii to provide backup support by temporarily issuing warnings and advisories. Many anemometers near the northern coastline failed from the winds.<ref name="nws"/> The winds collapsed several walls at the Guam Memorial Hospital, resulting in major damage throughout the northern two-thirds of the facility and several units being shut down. Several hotels, churches, and schools received moderate damage, and the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport received damage to navigation equipment.<ref name="ncdc"/> Typhoon Pongsona also left 65% of the island's water wells inoperable,<ref name="ncdc"/> with most of Guam left without water service following the storm.<ref name="femupdate"/> Officials estimate the typhoon destroyed 1,300&nbsp;homes, severely damaged 1,825, and lightly damaged 4,800.<ref></ref>

Tracking slowly across the center of the island, the intense inner rainbands dropped heavy rainfall which peaked at 650&nbsp;mm (25.61&nbsp;in) at the Pago and Asan Rivers; overflown rivers caused damage to some roads and bridges. The rainfall also caused extensive flooding in several villages. Pongsona produced a Piti, leaving some buildings on the west coast of the island flooded with 1&nbsp;m (4&nbsp;ft) of water. The combination of strong storm surge and rough waves caused considerable beach erosion and severe coastal damage.<ref name="ncdc"/>

'''台风凤仙'''（JTWC编号：'''31W'''）是2002年太平洋台风季最后一个生成的热带气旋，袭击美国属地关岛期间造成重大损失，是2002年为美国带来最大经济代价的灾难。<ref name="femlast"></ref>“凤仙”是由朝鲜提供的名字，指凤仙花。凤仙在12月2日生成，5日增强至台风强度，8日以接近颠峰强度（10分钟最高持续风速为175千米每小时）袭击关岛和北马里亚纳群岛。它最后转向东北并减弱，11日转化为温带气旋。

凤仙吹袭期间，关岛全岛电力供应中断，1,300间房屋被摧毁。因为该岛时常受风暴袭击，房屋的建筑质量较高，凤仙并没有直接造成人命损失。风暴共在关岛造成7亿美元（2002年，按2007年的物价计算则为8亿）的经济损失，是该岛首五个造成最大经济损失的热带气旋之一。此外，凤仙在北马里亚纳群岛也有造成重大损失。因此，“凤仙”的名字在风季后被退役。
