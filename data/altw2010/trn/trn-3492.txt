'''通用拼音'''是目前-{余伯泉}-在教育部國語推行委員會宣佈使用，並取代原定改用的國語注音符號第二式，此外也有意取代過去慣用的威妥瑪拼音。台灣政府自2002年起全面推行以通用拼音為基礎的統一譯音政策，但由於各界對於應使用何種拼音作為統一譯音仍有相當大的歧見（像是台北市政府即以與國際接軌為由，堅持使用漢語拼音），因此最終並未以強制方式要求使用。

通用拼音有個略去 f 而使用 v（注音符號：-{万}-）的音標版，可能原先用於客家話，但實際上拼讀國語時無用。

==拼音符號==
*'''聲母'''：b、p、m、f、d、t、n、l、g、k、h、ji、ci、si、jh、ch、sh、r、z、c、s
*'''韻母'''：a、o、e、-i、-u
*'''連韻'''：ai、ei、ao、ou、an、en（-in；-un；yun）、ang、eng（-ing；-ong；yong）、er 
*y,w,yu 作為'''結合音'''— '''y'''an、'''w'''an、'''yu'''an 的開頭使用。

==特徵==
通用拼音和漢語拼音有部分相似性，但是一些輔音不同。

===拼寫方式差異===
*漢語拼音的 '''q'''、'''x'''、'''zh''' 為通用拼音的 '''ci'''、'''si'''、'''jh'''（所以通用拼音不用 q 和 x ）。

*在漢語拼音中 zhi、chi、shi、ri、zi、ci、si 后的 '''i''' ，在通用拼音中使用 '''ih''' 。所以漢語拼音的 zhi、chi、shi、ri、zi、ci、si ，在通用拼音中即改拼為 jhih、chih、shih、rih、zih、cih、sih 。

*漢語拼音的 en、eng ，在通用拼音中，於以下情形拼法有所差異：
**連韻 '''e'''ng 接於韻母 f- 、w-（風、翁）之後時，改拼成 '''o'''ng 。
**w'''e'''n（文）改拼成 w'''u'''n 。

*yu 及以其開頭的結合音，接於韻母 ji- 、ci- 、si- 之後，仍使用 yu 銜接韻母，完全不使用 ü（在漢語拼音中音同「玉」），但韻母皆需將 i 去除。例如 j'''yu'''（居）、s'''yu'''e（雪）、c'''yu'''an（全） 

*韻母 ji- 、ci- 、si- 與連韻 yong 結合時，去除韻母的 i ，但保留連韻的 y 。例如漢語拼音的 yong（永）和 j'''iong'''（窘），在通用拼音中即拼為 yong（永）和 j'''yong'''（窘）。 

*原本縮寫的 '''iu'''（「六」的尾音）和 '''ui'''（「灰」的尾音）回歸為 '''iou''' 和 '''uei'''（過去實際上不常如此拼寫，不過目前教育部已統一規範）。

'''''Tongyong Pinyin''''' () is the current official Mandarin Chinese in the Republic of China. ROC's Ministry of Education approved the system in 2002 but its use is not mandatory.

==History==

The impetus behind the invention of ''Tongyong Pinyin'' came from the need for a standardized romanization system in Taiwan. For decades the island had employed various systems, usually simplifications or adaptations of Zhuyin fuhao,'' a standard phonetic system for language education in Taiwan's schools, does not employ the Latin alphabet.) 

Tourists, expatriates and immigrants in Taiwan most often use English when they are not familiar with Mandarin. The ''China and by the UN, offers strengths as a consistent phonetic system for Mandarin but has serious shortcomings in helping speakers with no training pronounce Mandarin words reliably. The sounds ''Hanyu Pinyin'' assigns to the letters <i>Q</i> and <i>X</i>, for example, are not idiomatic in the languages of most users of the Roman alphabet. ''Tongyong Pinyin'' represents an effort to preserve the strengths of the pinyin system while overcoming some of these difficulties.

The majority of Taiwan natives do not speak Mandarin as their mother tongue. The first language most individuals learn as children is Taiwanese. This language, unwritten until the nineteenth century, has historically lacked a consistent means of phonetic representation. The same situation exists with the mother tongues spoken by sizable minorities in Taiwan, such as Hakka and aboriginal peoples. The languages and literature of these people is a subject of study and education in Taiwan, and many place names (including the word <i>Taiwan</i> itself) are derived from languages other than Mandarin. ''Tongyong Pinyin'' thus represents an effort to provide a phonetic romanization system for Mandarin that, with very little modification, could be used to represent Taiwanese and other languages of the island.

''Tongyong Pinyin'' was introduced in Taiwan in 1998 by Yu Bor-chuan (余伯泉). The goal was to preserve the strengths of pinyin while overcoming some of the pronunciation difficulties ''Hanyu Pinyin'' presents to international readers. Ironically, using the system he developed to ameliorate this problem, most international readers will pronounce the second character of his name incorrectly as "bore." Yu's system has undergone some subsequent revision. 

Discussion and adoption of ''Tongyong Pinyin,'' like many other initiatives in Taiwan, quickly acquired a partisan cast turning on issues of national identity. Officials who identified most strongly with the island itself, such as the DPP and allied parties, saw no reason to adopt ''Hanyu Pinyin'' just because China and the UN had. If ''Tongyong Pinyin'' more adequately met the island's needs, Taiwan had reason enough to adopt it. Officials who identified more strongly with Chinese culture, such as the KMT, saw no reason to introduce a new system unique to Taiwan if ''Hanyu Pinyin'' had already gained international acceptance. Each side accused the other of basing its preference on anti-China or pro-China sentiment rather than an objective discussion of community goals.

In early October 2000 the Mandarin Commission of the Ministry of Education proposed to use ''Tongyong Pinyin'' as the national standard. Education Minister Ovid Tzeng (曾志朗) submitted a draft of the Taiwanese Romanization in late October to the Executive Yuan but the proposal was rejected. In November 2000 Minister Tzeng suggested the government adopt ''Hanyu Pinyin'' with some modifications for local dialects, but the proposal was rejected. On 10 July 2002 Taiwan's Ministry of Education held a meeting for 27 members. Only 13 attended. Two left early, plus the chairman could not vote, so the bill for using ''Tongyong Pinyin'' was passed by ten votes. In August 2002 the government adopted ''Tongyong Pinyin'' through an administrative order which local governments have the authority to override within their jurisdiction.

With the KMT's legislative and presidential electoral victories in 2008, ''Tongyong Pinyin'' may be replaced by ''Hanyu Pinyin'' as the ROC government standard.

==Adoption==

''Tongyong Pinyin'' is thus the official romanization system in Taiwan but its use is voluntary. The romanization system one encounters in Taiwan varies according to which government authority administers the facility. Street signs in most areas employ ''Tongyong Pinyin,'' including Kaohsiung City, Tainan City, Taichung City and neighboring counties. Taipei City uses ''Hanyu Pinyin'' exclusively. Taipei County uses ''Hanyu Pinyin'' with ''Tongyong Pinyin'' given in parentheses. Modified Wade-Giles spellings are still popularly used for many proper names, especially personal names and businesses.

The political impasse stalled Ministry of Education goals of replacing zhuyin with pinyin to teach pronunciation in elementary school. Zhuyin is still widely used to teach Mandarin pronunciation to schoolchildren. Children's books published in Taiwan typically display zhuyin characters next to Chinese characters in the text.

==Taiwanese language variant==

The ''Tongyong Pinyin'' system also exists in a Taiwanese phonetic symbol version (台語音標版) which lacks the letter ''f'' but adds the letter ''v'' (for 万). On September 28, 2006, the Ministry of Education rejected the use of ''Tongyong Pinyin'' for the Taiwanese dialect in favor of ''Pe̍h-ōe-jī'' (台羅版拼音).[http://pinyin.info/news/2006/moe-approves-taiwanese-romanization-tongyongists-protest/]

== Features ==
=== Spelling ===

Notable features of ''Tongyong Pinyin'' are:
* Tone 1 is unmarked. 
* ''Hanyu'' ''zh-'' becomes ''jh-'' (Wade-Giles uses ''ch-'').
* ''Hanyu'' ''x-'' and ''q-'' are completely unused in ''Tongyong Pinyin'': they become ''s-'' and ''c-'' (Wade-Giles uses ''hs-'' and ''ch-'').
* The ''Hanyu'' ''-i'' (not represented in zhuyin) known as the empty rime (空韻),  are shown as ''-ih'' (partially like Wade-Giles), i.e, those in ''Hanyu'' as ''zi'' (資), ''ci'' (慈), ''si'' (思), ''zhi'' (知), ''chi'' (吃), ''shi'' (詩), and ''ri'' (日) all end in ''-ih'' in ''Tongyong.'' 
* ''ü'' used in pinyin (written ''u'' after ''j'', ''q'' and ''x'') is replaced by ''yu''.
* ''-eng'' becomes ''ong'' after ''f-'' and ''w-'' (奉、瓮)
* ''wen'' (溫) becomes ''wun''
* ''-iong'' becomes ''yong'', e.g. ''syong'' instead of pinyin ''xiong'' (兇). (Cf. ''-iang'' remains unchanged: ''siang'').
* Unlike Wade-Giles and ''Hanyu,'' ''-iu'' and ''-ui'' [e.g., ''liu'' (六) and ''gui'' (鬼)] contractions can be optionally written out in full as ''-iou'' and ''-uei''. However, according to the Ministry of the Interior, in romanizations of names of places that is at township-level or below township-level, the letters must be written in full.

===Punctuation===
* ''Tongyong'' syllables in the same word (except placenames) are to be separated by hyphens, like Wade-Giles. Except that, in Ministry of the Interior's romanizations, placenames have no spaces between the syllables.
* ''Tongyong'' uses tone marks like zhuyin, and not like ''Hanyu,'' i.e., ''Tongyong'' has no mark for the first tone, but a dot for the neutral tone (which is optional on computers).
* The optional syllable disambiguity mark is apostrophe (like ''Hanyu),'' e.g., ''ji'nan'' vs. ''jin'an''. The mark may also, as in the Ministry of the Interior placenames, be a hyphen.

===Shared Features with ''Hanyu''===

Ignoring tone, 80.53% of the ''Tongyong Pinyin'' syllables are spelled identically to those of ''Hanyu Pinyin;'' 19.47% are spelled differently. The difference widens when syllables are measured according to average frequency of use in everyday life, resulting in a 48.84% difference in spellings.[http://research.chtsai.org/papers/pinyin-comparison.html]
