Gallows contributed a song to the Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden album with a cover of Wrathchild.

===Future===
In an interview with NME, Frank Carter stated that the band won't last past 2009 (five years together) and that it was not a commitment of his:
 	
"Gallows is not my life. It's a hobby I get paid for. I'm a tattoo artist - that will always be my life and job. Being in a band is something I do for fun. I quit the band four times before we signed to a major label. Gallows won't last five years."
 	
However he stated that in this period the band will record a second album, and possibly a third.<ref>[http://www.nme.com/news/gallows/31032 Gallows' Frank Carter: 'I'm quitting music' | News | NME.COM<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
