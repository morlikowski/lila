A '''Soling''' is a small class of 1972 Olympics. The Soling was an Olympic boat until its final appearance in 2000 at the Sydney Games. 

Abbottboats Inc. of Sarnia, Ontario, Canada was one of the world's lead builders of the Soling until a tragic fire in the Spring of 2006. Nowadays, Borresen Yachts is the licensed builder producing the boat. Company based in Denmark with production in Argentina.

The '''Soling''' is a strong boat designed for any wind and seas condition, fun to sail. Fitness, sailing and team skills are basic requirements for good racing. The boats are made in PFRV and are One Design boats coming from an authorized single plug and mould making competition as even as possible. Masts are made of aluminum alloy and the most known brand is Abbott, although Proctor, Borresen and other brands might be available in the market.

The lifetime of a '''Soling''' is long, those produced in the early days still sail beautifully and some are still in competition (more than 30 years after being built), but the average competition life of a '''Soling''' boat is considered 15 years making the Soling the perfect cost x benefit boat for racing purposes.
