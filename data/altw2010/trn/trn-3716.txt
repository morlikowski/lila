thumb|right|400px|Uit: De natuurgeneeswijze (Bilz,1923)  Dergelijke opvallende afwijkingen zal men tegenwoordig niet vaak meer aantreffen. Dit plaatje heeft waarschijnlijk meer een moreel-opvoedende bedoeling.
'''Syfilis''' of '''lues''' (verouderd: ''Franse ziekte'') is een seksueel overdraagbare aandoening (SOA) die wordt veroorzaakt door de konijn een ziekte die ook syfillis wordt genoemd. Deze bacterie is echter niet besmettelijk voor mensen.

Er zijn verschillende stadia van de infectie.
# een pijnloos geslachtsdelen of bij de mond, enige weken (10-90 dagen) na het contact;
# een stadium met huid- en andere afwijkingen, enige maanden later;
# het derde stadium: neurologische en psychiatrische verschijnselen. Het heeft heel lang geduurd voordat deze ziekte, die meestal pas jaren na de besmetting optreedt, is herkend als een laat gevolg van syfilis.

Lang niet iedereen die het eerste stadium doormaakt gaat door naar het tweede of het derde stadium; en hier zit ook bij degenen die niet genezen vaak een interval van vele jaren tussen. Er bestaat ook nog de '''aangeboren syfilis''' (gebit en de schenen.

De ziekte kan zich in zeer veel vormen voordoen, die vaak ook op andere ziekten lijken, en wordt omdat hij tegenwoordig in Nederland zeldzaam is nog wel eens gemist, wat jammer is omdat hij vooral in de vroege stadia zeer goed te behandelen is met antibiotica, met name giftig en heeft veel bijwerkingen. De diagnose is niet bijzonder lastig: een bloedtest toont antistoffen tegen de bacterie aan.

==Herkomst van de ziekte==
Onderzoek naar de herkomst van syfilis is voornamelijk gebaseerd op skelet-onderzoek. Botafwijkingen die karakteristiek zijn voor syfilis zijn afwezig bij skeletten in pre-Columbiaans (voor 1493) Europa, Afrika en Azië.<ref name="R"/> In Noord –en Zuid-Amerika kwamen deze kenmerkende afwijkingen al veer eerder voor. Afhankelijk van de locatie zo’n 600 tot 8000 jaar geleden. Het is dus duidelijk dat syfilis voor kwam in de Nieuwe Wereld (“Amerika”) op het moment dat Columbus daar arriveerde. Columbus landde in de Dominicaanse republiek, een gebied waar de skeletafwijkingen zijn gedocumenteerd voor skeletten uit de periode 800-1400 A.D. Columbus en zijn bemanning hadden de mogelijkheid deze SOA op te lopen en te verspreiden.<ref name="R"/>

==Etymologie==
De term "syfilis" vindt zijn oorsprong in een oude Griekse mythe over een schaapherder genaamd Syfilis. In 1530, gebruikt Girolamo Frasastoro in een gedicht voor het eerst de formulering "Syphilis sive morbus gallicus", Latijn voor "Syfilis of de Franse ziekte". In de 16e en 17e eeuw schaamde men zich voor deze ziekte, en de gewoonte ontstond de ziekte te noemen naar het land waar men (regelmatig) oorlog mee voerde of op historische gronden een hekel aan had gekregen. Duitsers en Engelsen noemden het "de Franse pokken"; de Russen "de Poolse ziekte"; de Polen "de Duitse ziekte"; de Fransen "de Napolitaanse ziekte"; de Hollanders, Portugezen en Noord-Afrikanen "de Spaanse ziekte" en de Japanners "de Chinese zweer".<ref name="R">Rothschild BM.History of syphilis. Clin Infect Dis. 2005;40:1454-63.</ref>

==Beroemde lijders==
Van een aantal bekende mensen in de geschiedenis wordt op meer of minder goede gronden vermoed dat zij aan syfilis hebben geleden. Een dergelijk vermoeden kan slechts zelden met hard bewijs worden gestaafd. Bij mensen die op latere leeftijd een beetje raar gingen doen deed het gerucht al gauw de ronde. Een aantal hiervan zijn: Al Capone, Vincent van Gogh, Bedřich Smetana, Édouard Manet, Paul Gauguin, Egon Schiele, Friedrich Nietzsche, Martín Alonso Pinzón, Franz Schubert, Alexander de Grote, Howard Hughes, en koning Willem III der Nederlanden<ref>Kikkert J.G. ''Oranje Bitter oranje boven'', pag. 293</ref>.Bij sommigen berust dit vermoeden trouwens louter op het gegeven dat de persoon in kwestie prostituees bezocht...

'''Syphilis''' is a curable antibiotic-resistant) can be easily treated with benzathine penicillin. If not treated, syphilis can cause serious effects such as damage to the heart, aorta, brain, eyes, and bones. In some cases these effects can be fatal. In 1998, the complete genetic sequence of ''T. pallidum'' was published which may aid understanding of the pathogenesis of syphilis.

== Alternative names==
The name "syphilis" was coined by the Italian physician and poet epic noted poem, written in Latin, entitled ''Syphilis sive morbus gallicus'' (Latin for "Syphilis or The French Disease") in 1530. The protagonist of the poem is a shepherd named Syphilus (perhaps a variant spelling of Sipylus, a character in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''). Syphilus is presented as the first man to contract the disease, sent by the god Apollo as punishment for the defiance that Syphilus and his followers had shown him. From this character Fracastoro derived a new name for the disease, which he also used in his medical text ''De Contagionibus'' ("On Contagious Diseases").<ref></ref>

Until that time, as Fracastoro notes, syphilis had been called the "French disease" in Italy and Germany, and the "Italian disease" in France. In addition, the Dutch called it the "Spanish disease", the Russians called it the "Polish disease", the Turks called it the "Christian disease" or "Frank disease" (''frengi'') and the Tahitians called it the "British disease". These 'national' names are due to the disease often being present among invading armies or sea crews, due to the high instance of unprotected sexual contact with Latin for "venereal plague") and "Cupid's disease" have also been used to refer to syphilis. In Scotland, Syphilis was referred to as the ''Grandgore''. The ulcers suffered by British soldiers in Portugal were termed "The Black Lion".<ref><br/>'''Referencing:'''<br/></ref>

== Origins ==
There have been three theories on the origin of syphilis which formed an ongoing debate in historical fields.

The '''Carbon dated skeletons of monks who lived in the friary showed bone lesions typical of venereal syphilis. Skeletons in pre-Columbus Pompeii and Metaponto in Italy demonstrating signs of congenital syphilis have also been found,<ref></ref><ref></ref> although the interpretation of the evidence has been disputed.<ref></ref>

The '''Columbus and Native Americans and cite documentary evidence linking crewmen of Columbus's voyages to the Naples outbreak of 1494.<ref>Baker, et al.<!-- absence of citation details (?book name or journal paper) makes this pretty meaningless--></ref>  A recent study of the genes of venereal syphilis and related bacteria has supported this theory, by locating an intermediate disease between yaws and syphilis in Guyana, South America.<ref></ref><ref name="pmid18235852"></ref>

Historian Alfred Crosby suggests both theories are correct in a '''combination theory.''' Crosby's argument is built on the similarities of the species of bacteria which cause yaws and syphilis. The bacterium that causes syphilis belongs to the same phylogenetic family as the bacteria which cause yaws and several other diseases. Despite a tradition of assigning yaws's homeland to sub-Saharan Africa, Crosby notes that there is no unequivocal evidence of any related disease being present in pre-Columbian Europe, Africa, or Asia, while there is indisputable evidence of syphilis' presence in the pre-Columbian Americas. Conceding this point, Crosby writes, "It is not impossible that the organisms causing treponematosis arrived from America in the 1490s...and evolved into both venereal and non-venereal syphilis and yaws."<ref name="225 Crosby">ref:225 Crosby<!-- absence of citation details (?book name or journal paper) makes this pretty meaningless - ?"The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492" or some other work ? --></ref>

However, Crosby considers it somewhat more likely that a highly contagious ancestral species of bacteria moved with early human ancestors across the land bridge of the Bering Straits many thousands of years ago without dying out in the original source population. He hypothesizes that "the differing ecological conditions produced different types of treponematosis and, in time, closely related but different diseases."<ref name="225 Crosby" /> 
Thus, a weak, non-syphilitic bacteria survived in the Old World to eventually give rise to yaws or pinta and the more aggressive syphilis.

Going further than Crosby in arguing for worldwide incidence of syphilis prior to Columbus, Douglas Owsley, the famed physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, has written that many medieval European cases of leprosy, colloquially called "lepra," were actually cases of syphilis. Although folklore claimed that syphilis was unknown in Europe until the return of the diseased sailors of the Columbian voyages,  (via JSTOR)</ref>}} Owsley noted that a Chinese medical case recorded in 2637 B.C.E. seems to be describing a case of syphilis, and that a European writer who recorded an outbreak of "lepra" in 1303 C.E. is "clearly describing syphilis".<ref name="OWSLEY"/>

== History ==
thumb|200px|Portrait of [[Gerard de Lairesse by The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', Summer 2007, pp. 55-56.</ref>]]
While working at the Rockefeller University (then called the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research) in 1913, Hideyo Noguchi, a Japanese scientist, demonstrated the presence of the spirochete ''Treponema pallidum'' in the brain of a progressive paralysis patient, proving that ''Treponema pallidum'' was the cause of the disease.<ref></ref> Prior to Noguchi's discovery, syphilis had been a burden to humanity in many lands, sometimes misdiagnosed and often misattributed to political enemies.

Some famous historical personages, including Hernando Cortez of Spain, insane and ultimately killed by the disease. Al Capone contracted syphilis as a young man. By the time he was incarcerated at Alcatraz, it reached its third stage, ''neurosyphilis'', leaving him confused and disoriented. Syphilis led to the death of artist Edouard Manet and artist Paul Gauguin is also said to have suffered from syphilis. Composers who succumbed to syphilis include Hugo Wolf, Frederick Delius, Scott Joplin, Gaetano Donizetti, and possibly Franz Schubert and Niccolò Paganini. 
 
The insanity caused by late-stage syphilis was once one of the more common forms of dementia; this was known as the general paresis of the insane. One suspected example is the insanity of noted composer Robert Schumann, although the precise cause of his death is still disputed by scholars.

The Russian author Leo Tolstoy suffered from syphilis during his youth, which was cured using arsenic treatment.<ref name="isbn0-393-32122-3"></ref>

A recent article in the ''European Journal of Neurology'' (June 2004) hypothesized that the founder of communism in Russia, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, died of neurosyphilis.<ref name="pmid15171732"></ref>

Karen Blixen, the author of ''Out of Africa'', contracted syphilis from her husband while living in Africa. He had contracted the disease from an African woman with whom he had been unfaithful. After having undergone treatment in Denmark, she returned to Africa. Blixen was unable to have children.

===European outbreak===
thumb|100px|A medical illustration attributed to [[Albrecht Dürer (1496) depicting a person with syphilis. Here, the disease is believed to have astrological causes.]]
The first well-recorded European outbreak of what is now known as syphilis occurred in 1494 when it broke out among French troops besieging Naples.<ref name=Scars_of_Venus></ref> The French may have caught it via Spanish mercenaries serving King Charles of France in that siege.<ref name="OWSLEY"/> From this centre, the disease swept across Europe. As Jared Diamond describes it, "when syphilis was first definitely recorded in Europe in 1495, its pustules often covered the body from the head to the knees, caused flesh to fall from people's faces, and led to death within a few months." In addition, the disease was more frequently fatal than it is today. Diamond concludes that "by 1546, the disease had evolved into the disease with the symptoms so well known to us today."<ref name=Diamond1></ref> The epidemiology of this first syphilis epidemic shows that the disease was either new or a mutated form of an earlier disease.

==Syphilis infection==
Different manifestations occur depending on the stage of the disease:

===Primary syphilis===
thumb|200px|Primary [[chancre of syphilis at the site of infection on the hand]]
''Primary syphilis'' is typically acquired via direct sexual contact with the infectious lesions of a person with syphilis.<ref name=RedBookSyphilis></ref> Approximately 10-90 days after the initial exposure (average 21 days), a skin lesion appears at the point of contact, which is usually the genitalia, but can be anywhere on the body. This lesion, called a ''chancre'', is a firm, painless skin ulceration localized at the point of initial exposure to the spirochete, often on the penis, vagina or rectum. Rarely, there may be multiple lesions present although typically only one lesion is seen. The lesion may persist for 4 to 6 weeks and usually heals spontaneously. Local lymph node swelling can occur. During the initial incubation period, individuals are otherwise asymptomatic. As a result, many patients do not seek medical care immediately.

Syphilis can ''not'' be contracted through toilet seats, daily activities, hot tubs, or sharing eating utensils or clothing.<ref></ref>
right| thumb|200px|Typical presentation of secondary syphilis rash on the palms of the hands and usually also seen on soles of feet

===Secondary syphilis===
''Secondary syphilis'' occurs approximately 1-6 months (commonly 6 to 8 weeks) after the primary infection. There are many different manifestations of secondary disease. There may be a symmetrical reddish-pink non-itchy rash on the trunk and extremities.<ref name=2darySyphilis></ref> The rash can involve the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. In moist areas of the body, the rash becomes flat broad whitish lesions known as condylomata lata. Mucous patches may also appear on the genitals or in the mouth. All of these lesions are infectious and harbor active treponeme organisms. A patient with syphilis is most contagious when he or she has secondary syphilis. Other symptoms common at this stage include renal disease, hypertrophic rectosigmoid mass, arthritis, periostitis, optic neuritis, intersitial keratitis, iritis, and uveitis.

===Latent syphilis===
''Latent syphilis'' is defined as having serologic proof of infection without signs or symptoms of disease.<ref name=RedBookSyphilis/> Latent syphilis is further described as either early or late. Early latent syphilis is defined as having syphilis for two years or less from the time of initial infection without signs or symptoms of disease. Late latent syphilis is infection for greater than two years but without clinical evidence of disease. The distinction is important for both therapy and risk for transmission. In the real-world, the timing of infection is often not known and should be presumed to be late for the purpose of therapy. Early latent syphilis may be treated with a single intramuscular injection of a long-acting penicillin. Late latent syphilis, however, requires three weekly injections. For infectiousness, however, late latent syphilis is not considered as contagious as early latent syphilis.

===Tertiary syphilis===
''Tertiary syphilis'' usually occurs 1-10 years after the initial infection, though in some cases it can take up to 50 years. This stage is characterized by the formation of gummas which are soft, tumor-like balls of inflammation known as granulomas. The granulomas are chronic and represent an inability of the immune system to completely clear the organism. Gummas were once readily seen in the skin and mucous membranes although they tend to occur internally in recent history. They may appear almost anywhere in the body including in the skeleton. The gummas produce a chronic inflammatory state in the body with mass-effects upon the local anatomy. Other characteristics of untreated tertiary syphilis include neuropathic joint disease, which is a degeneration of joint surfaces resulting from loss of sensation and fine position sense (proprioception). The more severe manifestations include neurosyphilis and cardiovascular syphilis. In a study of untreated syphilis, 10% of patients developed cardiovascular syphilis, 16% had gumma formation, and 7% had neurosyphilis.<ref name=Oslo></ref>

Neurological complications at this stage can be diverse. In some patients, manifestations include generalized paresis of the insane which results in personality changes, changes in emotional affect, hyperactive reflexes, and Argyll-Robertson pupil. This is a diagnostic sign in which the small and irregular pupils constrict in response to focusing the eyes, but not to light.  Tabes dorsalis, also known as locomotor ataxia, a disorder of the spinal cord, often results in a characteristic shuffling gait. See below for more information about neurosyphilis.

Cardiovascular complications include coronary arteries and cause narrowing of the vessels. Syphilitic aortitis can cause ''de Musset's sign'',<ref name="pmid7013091"></ref> a bobbing of the head that de Musset first noted in Parisian prostitutes.

===Neurosyphilis===
''Neurosyphilis'' refers to a site of infection involving the antiretroviral therapy in recent years has further complicated such characterization.

Approximately 35% to 40% of persons with secondary syphilis have asymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) involvement, as demonstrated by any of these on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination:
*An abnormal leukocyte cell count, protein level, or glucose level
*Demonstrated reactivity to Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) antibody test

There are four clinical types of neurosyphilis:
* Asymptomatic neurosyphilis
* Meningovascular syphilis
* General paresis<ref name=AMN></ref>
* Tabes dorsalis

The late forms of neurosyphilis (tabes dorsalis and general paresis) are seen much less frequently since the advent of antibiotics. The most common manifestations today are asymptomatic or symptomatic meningitis. Acute syphilitic meningitis usually occurs within the first year of infection; 10% of cases are diagnosed at the time of the secondary rash. Patients present with headache, meningeal irritation, and cranial nerve abnormalities, especially the optic nerve, facial nerve, and the vestibulocochlear nerve. Rarely, it affects the spine instead of the brain, causing focal muscle weakness or sensory loss. 

Meningovascular syphilis occurs a few months to 10 years (average, 7 years) after the primary syphilis infection. Meningovascular syphilis can be associated with vertigo, ischemic stroke, an outcome more commonly seen in younger patients. Angiography may be able to demonstrate areas of narrowing in the blood vessels or total occlusion.

General paresis, otherwise known as general paresis of the insane, is a severe manifestation of neurosyphilis. It is a chronic depression, or mania. Imaging of the brain usually shows atrophy.

==Diagnostic tests==
===Early 20th century===
In 1906, the first effective test for syphilis, the false positive reactions than the Wassermann test. Both of these early tests have been superseded by newer analytical methods.

===Modern diagnostic tests===
It was only in the 20th century that effective tests and treatments for syphilis were developed. Microscopy of fluid from the primary or secondary lesion using darkfield illumination can diagnose treponemal disease with high accuracy. As there are other treponemes that may be confused with ''T. pallidum,'' care must be taken in evaluating with microscopy to correlate symptoms with the correct disease. 

thumb|left|Star Wars themed parade float promoting syphilis testing at a 2005 parade in Seattle, Washington, United States.
Present-day syphilis screening tests, such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) tests are cheap and fast but not completely specific, as many other conditions can cause a positive result. These tests are routinely used to screen blood donors. Notably, the spirochete that causes syphilis does not survive the conditions used to store blood and the number of transfusion transmitted cases of syphilis is minuscule, but the test is used to identify donors that might have contracted pinta. Tests based on enzyme-linked immunoassays are also used to confirm the results of simpler screening tests for syphilis. 

Neurosyphilis is diagnosed by finding high numbers of CSF or abnormally high protein concentration in the setting of syphilis infection.<ref name=RedBookSyphilis/> In addition, CSF should be tested with the VDRL test although some advocate using the FTA-ABS test to improve sensitivity. There is anecdotal evidence that the incidence of neurosyphilis is higher in HIV patients, and some have recommended that all HIV-positive patients with syphilis should have a lumbar puncture to look for asymptomatic neurosyphilis.<ref></ref>

===Other Treponematoses===
Treponematoses are diseases caused by species of the spirochete Treponema. In addition to Syphilis, this group includes:
*Yaws is a tropical disease characterized by an infection of the skin, bones and joints; it is caused by ''Treponema pallidum'' subspecies ''pertenue''.
*Pinta - caused by ''Treponema carateum''.
*Bejel - caused by ''Treponema pallidum'' subspecies ''endemicum''.

==Treatment==
thumb|175px|Depression-era U.S. poster advocating early syphilis treatmentthumb|175px|Application of mercury.
===Prevention===
While abstinence from any sexual activity is very effective at helping prevent syphilis, it should be noted that ''T. pallidum'' readily crosses intact mucosa and cut skin, including areas not covered by a condom. Proper and consistent use of a latex condom is effective against the spread of syphilis through sexual contact.[http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/STDFact-Syphilis.htm#protect] 

Individuals sexually exposed to a person with primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis within 90 days preceding the diagnosis should be assumed to be infected and treated for syphilis, even if they are currently seronegative. If the exposure was more than 90 days before the diagnosis, presumptive treatment is recommended if serologic testing is not immediately available or if follow-up is uncertain. Patients with syphilis of unknown duration and nontreponemal serologic titers ≥1:32 may be considered as having early syphilis for purposes of partner notification and presumptive treatment of sex partners. Long-term sex partners of patients with late syphilis should be evaluated clinically and serologically and treated appropriately. All patients with syphilis should be tested for HIV. Patient education is important as well.

===History of treatments===
There were originally no effective treatments for syphilis. The Spanish priest mercury: the use of which gave rise to the saying "A night in the arms of Venus leads to a lifetime on Mercury".<ref></ref>  It was administered multiple ways including by mouth and by rubbing it on the skin. One of the more curious methods was fumigation, in which the patient was placed in a closed box with his head sticking out. Mercury was placed in the box and a fire was started under the box which caused the mercury to vaporize. It was a grueling process for the patient and the least effective for delivering mercury to the body.

As the disease became better understood, more effective treatments were found. The first antibiotic to be used for treating disease was the Salvarsan, developed in 1908 by Sahachiro Hata while working in the laboratory of Nobel prize winner Paul Ehrlich. This was later modified into Neosalvarsan. Unfortunately, these drugs were not 100% effective, especially in late disease. It had been observed that some who develop high fevers could be cured of syphilis. Thus, for a brief time malaria was used as treatment for tertiary syphilis because it produced prolonged and high fevers. This was considered an acceptable risk because the malaria could later be treated with quinine which was available at that time. This discovery was championed by Julius Wagner-Jauregg, who won the 1927 Nobel Prize for Medicine for his work in this area. Malaria as a treatment for syphilis was usually reserved for late disease, especially neurosyphilis, and then followed by either Salvarsan or Neosalvarsan as adjuvant therapy. These treatments were finally rendered obsolete by the discovery of penicillin, and its widespread manufacture after World War II allowed syphilis to be effectively and reliably cured.<ref name=Brown></ref>

===Current treatment===
The first-choice treatment for all manifestations of syphilis remains penicillin G.<ref name=CDC></ref> The effect of penicillin on syphilis was widely known before randomized clinical trials were used; as a result, treatment with penicillin is largely based on case series, expert opinion, and years of clinical experience. Parenteral penicillin G is the only therapy with documented effect during pregnancy. For early syphilis, one dose of penicillin is sufficient.

Non-pregnant individuals who have severe allergic reactions to penicillin (e.g., CDC recommends desensitization with penicillin followed by penicillin treatment. All pregnant women with syphilis should be desensitized and treated with penicillin. Follow-up includes clinical evaluation at 1 to 2 weeks followed by clinical and serologic evaluation at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after treatment. 

Azithromycin has been used to treat syphilis in the past because of easy once-only dosing. However, in one study in San Francisco, azithromycin-resistance rates in syphilis, which were 0% in 2000, were 56% by 2004.<ref name="pmid16392078"></ref>

====Late latent and infections of unknown duration====
Late latent syphilis is defined as latency for greater than one year. If CSF examination yields no evidence of neurosyphilis, then penicillin G is recommended as weekly doses for 3 weeks. If allergic, then tetracycline or doxycycline may also be used for this stage, but for 28 days instead of the normal 14. As with before, the data to support use of tetracycline and ceftriaxone are limited.

====Treatment of neurosyphilis====
For patients diagnosed with neurosyphilis including ocular or auditory syphilis with or without positive CSF results, aqueous crystalline penicillin G is the treatment of choice. The recommended regimen is intravenous treatment every 4 hours or continuously for 10-14 days. If intravenous administration is not possible, then procaine penicillin is an alternative (administered daily with probenecid for two weeks). Procaine injections are painful, however, and patient compliance may be difficult to ensure. To approximate the 21-day course of therapy for late latent disease and to address concerns about slowly dividing treponemes, most experts now recommend 3 weekly doses of benzathine penicillin G after the completion of a 14-day course of aqueous crystalline or aqueous procaine penicillin G for neurosyphilis. No oral antibiotic alternatives are recommended for the treatment of neurosyphilis. The only alternative that has been studied and shown to be effective is intramuscular ceftriaxone daily for 14 days. Neurosyphilis dementia is also a psychiatric diagnosis where as a multitude of atypical anti-psychotic medications are used to help control the patient's irrational behaviors with limited success.
Also used in traditional classification of Organic Disorders in the brain. Also commonly called Brain Syphilis.

====Alternative regimens==== 
Alternative regimens such as tetracyclines are not well studied in HIV infection and a careful follow-up is recommended. Tetra-cyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy. 

HIV-infected patients with early syphilis may have a higher risk of neurological complications and a higher rate of treatment failure with currently recommended regimens. The magnitude of these risks, however, although not precisely defined, is probably small. Skin testing or desensitization is recommended in latent syphilis and neurosyphilis in other patients with HIV infection.
