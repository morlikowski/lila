'''''Dominions: Priests, Prophets and Pretenders''''' is a Illwinter Game Design, in which up to fourteen "pretender gods" at a time each battle for global dominance. As of Dominions 2: The Ascension Wars''''', and '''''Dominions 3: The Awakening'''''.

==Gameplay==
Two to fourteen "pretender gods" battle for global supremacy with over 600 units, 400 magic spells and 300 magical items. Players are allowed to customize their god, selecting physical appearance, magical skills and dominions scales, including luck, heat and order. The main map is divided into smaller sections (called provinces), and each battle that takes place is within a province, for control of the province. There can be hundreds of provinces on a map. To win, one must ensure that no other player controls a single province, or that their dominion is non-existent (See section 1.3).

===Units===
Once each god and nation has been selected, each player must begin the process of building an empire. In the early stages of the game, this is mainly accomplished through the use of standard troops. The player must first recruit a commander (the player can also use his or her god). Each commander can lead a certain number of troops, a number which increases as the commander gains experience. In order to be effective, however, the commander also needs units. Each unit has its own attributes, such as strength and armor. Units are built by supplying a certain amount of gold and resource, the amount varying based on the unit. The units are then placed under the leadership of a commander, and are subdivided into squads by the player. 

The player can set basic orders for each squad and place them on the battlefield in order to maximize their potential. For example, a player might place a squad of ranged units behind a squad of militia and light infantry and order it to fire on the closest enemy, so the archers are protected and provide cover for the infantry. The battles, however, are determined by computer calculations taking into account troop number, quality and pre-set tactics, and then may be viewed by the player as a short video clip. Units may route during battle if they are outnumbered, or if their commander dies. If they make it off the battlefield, units will flee to the nearest friendly province. Units may also be wounded or killed in battle. Different wounds reduce different stats.
