'''Zoološke vrtove''' ljudi uređuju da bi makar u donekle prirodnim uvjetima mogli promatrati život životinja. 

== Savremeno uređivanje zooloških vrtova ==

U njih smještaju vidra ima bazen za plivanje i nekoliko trulih panjeva u koje se može zavući; kod medvjed ima umjetnu spilju, zebre dovoljno mjesta za trčanje itd. 

Tu nema više kaveza sa željeznim šipkama i rešetkama kao u zoološkim vrtovima starijeg tipa. Da životinje ne pobjegnu, podignuti su oko njihovih nastamba zidići i iskopani jarci s vodom,a lavovi su npr. smješteni u velikim ulegnućima iz kojih ne mogu iskočiti. Jedino su ptice ostale u prostranim kavezima od žičane mreže,da ne odlete; ali je u tim kavezima drveće, grmlje i slično. Takve, moderno uređene zoološke vrtove nazivamo i zoološki parkovi. U njima se mogu držati i veće skupine životinja: čopori majmuna, krda antilopa, jata ptica močvarica i slično. Tako će njihov život biti sličniji životu u slobodnoj prirodi. U zoološkom vrtu mnoge životinje, ako su same, brzo uginu; ako je više životinja iste vrste zajedno, lakše se priviknu novim uvjetima života. Čak se i razmnožavaju kao da su u slobodnoj prirodi. Njihova mladunčad lakše će podnositi život u zarobljeništvu, nego one životinje koje su ulovljene i stavljene u zoološki vrt. Životinje u zoološkom vrtu zaštićene su od prirodnih neprijatelja. Hrana im je osigurana u dovoljnim količinama, isto tako i veterinarska briga ako obole. Zato većina životinja u zoološkom vrtu živi duže nego u slobodnoj prirodi.

Zoološke vrtove posjećuju ponajviše učenici. Tu pobliže upoznaju životinje o kojima uče u školi. Posebnu važnost zoološki vrtovi imaju za stručnjake, zoologe i biologe.

Zoološki vrtovi su povremeno na udaru kritika udruga za zaštiti životinja. Naime, pojedini zoološki vrtovi se razlikuju, kako po brizi za životinje, tako i po svojoj opremljenosti te stupnju komfora koji pružaju životinjama. Najčešće kritike su upućene pojedinim zoološkim vrtovima, češće u nerazvijenim zemljama, zbog zapuštenosti životinja, ali i na uvjete u kojima one žive, prije svega na neadekvatnost kaveza. To može uzrokovati nenormalna ponašanja, kao klimanje glavom, stalno trčanje uz ogradu, griženje čeličnih šipki i samoozljeđivanje. Problem je i to što su neke životinje, koje u prirodi žive kao samotnjaci, smještene u kavez sa više jedinki, i obrnuto.

A '''zoological garden''', shortened to '''zoo''', is an institution in which living animals are exhibited in captivity.  In addition to their status as tourist attractions and recreational facilities, modern zoos may engage in captive breeding programs, conservation study, and educational outreach.  Zoos are a subject of controversy stemming from many sources, including the quality of life of the animals they exhibit, and the perceived necessity or purpose of exhibiting captive animals at all.  Zoos are frequently criticized by animal rights groups.

Collections of wild animals existed already in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, and China. In medieval Europe some monarchs, monasteries, and municipalities continued to maintain collections of wild animals. The transition from nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many new zoos and related facilities were founded for very different motives and purposes.

Zoo professionals proclaim demanding aims for their institutions, from educating the public to conservation of conservation.  Animal-rights groups claim that there is a wide gap between these claimed aims and actual practice, and that zoos have commercial and entertainment purposes in mind as well as financial profit. 

Types of zoo include urban, open-range, safari, animal theme, roadside, rescue, sanctuary, petting, and specialized. The most traditional form of maintaining wild animals in captivity is keeping them in (pitted enclosures),aviaries, or fenced paddocks. Most zoological gardens incorporated within international umbrella organizations are led by professionals such as zoologists or veterinarians.

==Etymology== 
The terms ''zoo'' and ''zoological garden'', that refer to Greek: zωο, ''zoion'', "animal"; and λόγος, ''logos'', "knowledge"), did not come into use until the modern zoo concept developed during the nineteenth century. The Zoological Society of London first used this term to describe its collection at Regent's Park, although this collection was simultaneously referred to as a menagerie. Most zoo founders of the nineteenth century operated with the term ''zoological garden'' to distinguish their institutions from the aristocratic and travelling menageries.
The abbreviation ''zoo'' first appeared in Britain about 1847, when it was used for the Clifton Zoo, but it was not until some twenty years later that the shortened form became popular by a song called "Walking in the Zoo on Sunday".<ref>Blunt, Wilfrid, ''The Ark in the Park. The Zoo in the Nineteenth Century'', Book Club Associates, London, 1976, p. 29.</ref> Relatively new terms for zoos, which were coined in the late twentieth century, are ''conservation park'' or ''biopark''. Adopting a new name is a strategy by some zoo professionals to distance their institutions from the stereotypical and nowadays criticized zoo concept of the nineteenth century.<ref>Maple, Terry, "Toward a Responsible Zoo Agenda", in ''Ethics on the Ark'', Bryan G. Norton et al. (ed.), Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington 1995, p. 25. ISBN 1-56098-515-1</ref>

===From ancient to modern times===

Collections of wild animals existed already in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, and China.
Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut established a zoo in Thebes around 1490 BC. Hatshepsut's zoo contained exotic animals collected from what is today Somalia, and it included leopards, monkeys and a giraffe.<ref>Croke, Vicki, ''The Story of Zoos, Past, Present and Future'', Scribner, New York, 1997. ISBN 068419712x</ref>
In ancient China, wild animals, especially exotic species, held the interest of rulers and the wealthy class. Starting with the founder of the Qin, Han, Tang, and Song dynasties continued the fashion of large royal parks, where birds and mammals were kept in cages for personal pleasure and the demonstration of wealth and power.<ref>Kisling, Vernon N., "Ancient Collections and Menageries", in ''Zoo and Aquarium History'', ed. Vernon N. Kisling, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2001, pp. 1-47. ISBN 0-8493-2100-x</ref>  

Also in the ancient Greek and Roman world live animal collections existed. Historians have written many publications about extravagant and bloodthirsty spectacles in Rome, involving wild animals. However, little has been written about the facilities of keeping those animals.<ref>Jennison, George, ''Animals for Show and Pleasure in Ancient Rome'', Manchester University Press, Manchester 1937.</ref> The Latin word ''vivarium'' referred to the stockyards and arenas where wild animals were held for public spectacles.<ref>Kisling, Vernon N., "Ancient Collections and Menageries", in ''Zoo and Aquarium History'', ed.

===Evolution of the modern zoo concept===
thumb|right|Evolution of the modern zoo concept
The transition from menagerie, a predominantly private collection, to public institution marks the beginning of the modern zoo concept. Collections established during the nineteenth century began calling themselves ''zoological gardens''. In some cases this was simply fashionable since zoos were considered professionally managed facilities, whether they were or not. In other cases there was an emphasis on education and science rather than on entertainment.
The first modern zoo, established particularly for scientific and Rousseau -- while the buildings themselves housed caged animals as if in cabinets.

About thirty years later, the members of the Zoological Society of London adopted the idea of the early Paris zoo when they established London Zoo in 1827.<ref>Barrington-Johnson, J., ''The Zoo: The Story of London Zoo'', Robert Hale, London, 2005, p. 28. ISBN 0-7090-7372-0</ref>  
It opened in 1828 in Regent's Park, admitting members and their guests. Only in 1847 were working people allowed in, for a shilling.
The success of London Zoo set off a Victorian wave of similar establishments.

In the United States, physician William Camac initiated the incorporation of the Zoological Society of Philadelphia in 1859.

About 1861/62, a smaller zoo with lower standards had been already established in New York City, the Central Park Zoo.<ref>Kisling, Vernon N., "Zoological Gardens of the United States", in ''Zoo and Aquarium History'', Vernon N.

When the first American zoological gardens came into existence, only a few supporters of the early animal welfare movement spoke out against zoos. Humanitarians protested cruelty in training animals for circuses more often than they opposed zoos. Their concerns were that zoo animals were healthy and well cared for, and not subjected to cruelty or pain.<ref>Hanson, Elizabeth, ''Animal Attractions: Nature on Display in American Zoos'', Princeton University Press 2002, Princeton, pp. 179,180.

Many zoos define their aims as conservation.
Animal-rights groups claim that there is a wide gap between the claimed aims and actual practice, and that owners of zoos have commercial and philosopher Dale Jamieson asserted that zoos generally do not live up to their own goals, that zoo animals are deprived of freedom for little social or scientific good, and that zoos cause suffering without producing compensatory benefits for animals or people.<ref>Jamieson, Dale, "Against Zoos", in ''In Defense of Animals'', ed. Peter Singer, Harper & Row, New York, 1985, pp. 108-117.</ref> Jamieson argues that a moral presumption against keeping animals in captivity outweighs any benefit that might accrue from education, science, or species preservation.<ref>Hanson, Elizabeth, ''Animal Attractions: Nature on Display in American Zoos'', Princeton University Press 2002, Princeton, p. 183.

French historians Baratay and Hardouin-Fugier see zoos as an allegory for the contradictions of modern Western societies: "The zoo made concrete, in an enclosed space, what society wanted to do in nature, as, with the advance of urbanization, people felt an increasing need to preserve the wild. But the desire remained unrealized, because Western society did not want its methods called into question, and because, in the final analysis, it preferred to transplant, delimit, cultivate and arrange nature however and wherever it liked, rather than leave places truly free of human influence."<ref name=Baratay281/>

Jamieson points out that "we should have the honesty to recognize that zoos are for us rather than for the animals".<ref>Jamieson, Dale, "Zoos Revisted", in ''Ethics on the Ark'', Bryan G. Norton et al. (ed.), Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, 1995, p. 62.</ref> According to Swiss zoologist Hediger, Heini, ''Man and Animal in the Zoo'', Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, 1969.</ref>

===Education===
Since the beginning of the modern zoological gardens biological knowledge has been one of the most prominent aims claimed by zoo professionals. Already in ecological and natural habitat.<ref>Malamud, Randy, ''Reading Zoos: Representations of Animals in Captivity'', New York University Press, New York, 1998.</ref> Rather than promoting respect for understanding behavioral and ecological aspects of animals, signs in zoos often provide little more information than an animal’s species, diet, and natural range.

The captive breeding of endangered species is coordinated by cooperative breeding programs. Under the auspices of WAZA, 182 ''International Studbooks'' are kept. These studbooks are coordinated by the Zoological Society of London. About 810 animal species and subspecies are managed under cooperative breeding programmes at the level of the regional association members such as the Species Survival Plan (SSP), established 1981, or the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), established 1985.<ref>[http://www.waza.org/conservation/index.php World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA)] retrieved on April 18, 2008.</ref>  

But critics point to the marginal contribution of zoos to the preservation of biodiversity. Andrew Linzey, director of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics, argues that zoos make a "minuscule contribution to conservation."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7175652.stm BBC News] retrieved on January 8, 2008.</ref>
Most conservation experts agree that few of the rare or endangered species can be saved from extinction by breeding them in captivity. In 1990, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) drew up an action plan for the survival of 1370 species. It considered that the reintroduction of captive bred animals could assist in the conservation of only 19 species (1.4 percent).<ref>[http://www.wildlife.org.nz/zoocheck/cons.htm Wildlife New Zealand] retrieved on April 24, 2008.</ref> 
How controversial ex-situ conservation is, shows the captive breeding program for the critically endangered Sumatran rhinoceros. Between 1984 and 1996, 40 Sumatran Rhinos were transported from their native habitat to zoos and reserves across the world. After years of failed attempts and a dramatic decline of the captive population, one individual gave birth to a healthy male calf at Cincinnati Zoo in September 2001. This was the first successful captive birth of a Sumatran Rhino in 112 years. Two other calves followed in 2004 and 2007. Despite the recent successes in Cincinnati, the captive breeding program has remained controversial. Proponents argue that zoos have aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits, raising public awareness and education about the rhinos, and helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra. Opponents of the captive breeding program argue that losses are too great; the program too expensive; removing rhinos from their habitat, even temporarily, alters their ecological role; and captive populations cannot match the rate of recovery seen in well-protected native habitats.<ref>Foose, Thomas J. and van Strien, Nico, ''Asian Rhinos – Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan'', IUCN, Gland, Switzerland, and Cambridge, UK, 1997.

===Urban zoos===
Urban zoos are the classical zoological gardens that stand in the tradition of the nineteenth century zoo concept, even if some of them changed their names to ''Conservation Park'' or ''Biopark''. Most of them are relatively small in size and based within cities or urbanized areas, a fact that often complicates the construction of more sizable enclosures. In Europe a famous urban zoo is the Antwerp Zoo in Belgium, right next to the central station of the city.

Some zoos concentrate on animals of geographical regions (''geozoo'') or attempt to exhibit their animals in a different way of the opening by night (''night safari'').

===Open-range zoos===
A number of open-range zoos have been established since the early Zoological Society of San Diego. The Werribee Open Range Zoo near Melbourne, Australia, concentrates on displaying animals living in a wide open savanna. This 500-acre zoo is managed by the Zoological Parks and Gardens Board which also manages Melbourne Zoo. One of only two American state supported zoos is the 535-acre North Carolina Zoo located in Asheboro, North Carolina.

===Safari parks===
A safari park is a zoo-like commercial tourist attraction where visitors can drive in their own vehicles and observe the wildlife, rather than viewing animals in cages or small enclosures. Most safari parks were established in a short period of ten years, between 1966 and 1975.

===Animal theme parks===
An animal theme park is a combination of an entertaining and commercial purposes. Sea World and Marineland are more elaborate dolphinariums keeping whales, and containing additional entertainment attractions.

Another kind of animal theme park is Disney's Animal Kingdom in Orlando, Florida or Busch Gardens Africa in Tampa, Florida. These commercial parks are similar to open-range zoos according to size (550 acres, 2 km²), but different in intention and appearance since they contain far more entertainment elements (stage shows, roller coasters, mythical creatures etc.).

===Roadside zoos===
There are hundreds of substandard wildlife attractions throughout the AZA. The focus is on amusing customers, rather than on meeting the needs of the animals. Roadside zoos often lack trained, experienced animal care staff, proper funding and safety practices.  Animals are confined to small, barren, often filthy cages, and suffer poor welfare as a result of inadequate housing, care and diet. Roadside zoos breed animals in order to have a constant supply of cute babies to attract the public. Big cat rescues, primate rescues, and native wildlife rescues are overwhelmed due to the constant influx of animals coming out of roadside zoos.<ref>[http://www.ontariozoos.ca/ Ontariozoos] retrieved on April 18, 2008; [http://www.theguzoo.com/main_page.html World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA)] retrieved on April 18, 2006.</ref>

===Rescues and sanctuaries===  
sanctuaries for wild animals. The animal welfare organization WSPA established several of these facilities for rescued bears worldwide. According to the organization those in Greece and Turkey have helped stamp out the tradition of forcing bears to perform tricks for public entertainment.<ref>[http://www.wspa-international.org/campaigns.asp?campaignType=1 World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA)] retrieved on April 18,2008.</ref> Another type of sanctuary takes the form of a rehabilitation and release center. An example of this is the Idaho Black Bear Rehabilitation Center, where orphaned bear cubs are cared for and prepared for release back into the wild.<ref>[http://www.bearrehab.org/  Idaho Black Bear Rehabilitation Center] retrieved on April 18, 2008.</ref> Another sanctuary, especially for apes and primates, is 65-acre (0.26 km²) Monkey World near Wool, Dorset, England. Set up in 1987 it was originally intended to provide a home for abused chimpanzees used by Spanish beach photographers, but is now home to many different species of primates.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/jan/30/animalwelfare.world The Guardian] retrieved on April 24, 2008.</ref>

===Petting zoos===
A petting zoo, also called children's farms or children's zoos, features a combination of domestic animals and wild species that are docile enough to touch and feed. To ensure the animals' health, the food is supplied by the zoo, either from vending machines or a kiosk nearby.

===Specialized zoos===
Some zoos specialized on specific groups of animals such as bird parks (public aviaries), reptile zoos (serpentaria), public aquaria or butterfly zoos.

==Exhibitry==

===Traditional enclosures and new approaches===
The most traditional form of maintaining wild animals in captivity is keeping them in pits, aviaries, or fenced paddocks, although many zoos replaced these by more elaborate and spacious enclosures that attempt to replicate their natural habitats, for the benefit of the animals and the visitors.
<ref>Tarpy, Cliff, "News Zoos: Taking down the Bars", National Geographic, Vol.184, No.1, July 1993, pp.2-37.</ref>

German merchant Carl Hagenbeck developed a new form of animal exhibition at the beginning of the twentieth century. When he opened his private owned zoo at Stellingen near Hamburg, (Tierpark Hagenbeck) in 1907, Hagenbeck had broken with a strong tradition to exhibit animals in accordance with taxonomy. He created a new style of exhibition based on ecological and geographical habitats including different species. For example, the "Northern Panorama" exhibited seals and walruses in a pool in the foreground, with reindeer behind them, and polar bears behind the reindeer. The different enclosures were divided with moats not visible to the public, and the successive enclosures were higher than the one in front. The exhibits were landscaped with plants and artificial rocks. This gave the public the impression they were seeing the animals together in one natural habitat. After initial skepticism, many zoological gardens throughout the world adopted Hagenbeck's ideas and replaced traditional enclosures. Edinburgh Zoo, for example, was one of these institutions inspired by Hagenbeck’s new design.<ref> Strehlow, Harro, "Zoological Gardens of Western Europe", in ''Zoo and Aquarium History'', Vernon N.

The new panoramas benefited the aesthetic sense of visitors and can be seen as mainly anthropocentric constructions.

During the 1930s, some attemps were made to introduce abstract design into the modern zoo architecture.

From the Swiss zoologist Hediger, Heini, ''Wild Animals in Captivity'', Butterworth, London, 1950.</ref> In this work he gave cogent arguments for a biological and particularly behavioural approach to zoo design and animal care.<ref>Hancocks, David, ''A different nature: the paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future'', University of California Press, Berkeley, 2001, p.78. ISBN 0-520-21879-5</ref>But the attempts to integrate the knowledge about animal behaviour into zoo design were often ineffectual and not consequently implemented. More important than behaviour and welfare of the animals remained hygienic aspects and, above all, architectural innovation such as New Brutalism. The Elephant and Rhino Pavilion at London Zoo, designed by Hugh Casson and built 1962-1965, is such an example. Most enclosures constructed from the 1950s to the 1970s were sterile and small cages made of concrete or ceramic tiles.<ref>Guillery, Peter, ''The Buildings of London Zoo'', Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England, London, 1993, p.43.
