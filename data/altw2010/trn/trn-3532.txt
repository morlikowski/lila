=== Le personnage '''Maciste''' ===

'''Maciste''' est un personnage mythique créé en 1913 dans le film ''Cabiria'' (Giovanni Pastrone). Interprété par le docker génois Bartolomeo Pagano, l'esclave herculéen fait sensation. Le personnage sera repris dans toute une série de films mettant en valeur ses qualités athlétiques, et ne se passant pas forcément sous l'Antiquité (''Maciste Alpino'' : par exemple, le voit soldat lors de la Première Guerre mondiale). Pagano restera Maciste jusqu'à la fin du cinéma muet ; après quoi le personnage tombe dans l'oubli.

Puis, vers la fin des Travaux d'Hercule'' (Goliath, Samson ou Ursus, sera le grand rival du demi-dieu grec. Contrairement à celui-ci, et suivant en cela l'exemple de son ancêtre du muet, le Maciste des années 1960 n'est limité ni géographiquement ni dans le temps, puisque, outre la Grèce des légendes, on peut le croiser en Égypte (''Maciste dans la vallée des rois''), en Russie au Moyen Âge (''Maciste à la cour du Tzar''), en Angleterre au  (''Maciste en enfer''), en Amérique au  (''Maciste contre Zorro'') ou en Afrique à une période indéterminée (''Maciste contre les coupeurs de têtes''). À l'occasion, il affrontera le comique Totò (''Totò contre Maciste'') ou se trouvera une fratrie (''Les Invincibles Frères Macistes'').

Comme ses confrères culturistes, Maciste ne survivra pas au déclin du péplum et aux assauts des pistoléros latins lachés sur les écrans à la suite du succès de « Pour une poignée de dollars ». Restent des films naïfs et bondissants, bourrés de monstres en carton-pâte, de rochers en mousse et de figurants en sandales, à qui le temps a donné une coloration kitsch et un charme indéniable.

'''Maciste''' () is one of the oldest recurring characters in cinema. He cuts a heroic figure throughout the history of the cinema of Italy, even if the movies that featured him were usually of poor artistic quality. He is usually depicted as a Hercules-like figure, utilizing his massive strength to achieve heroic feats that ordinary man cannot.

==Name==
Gabriele d'Annunzio, who invented the name for the 1914 film ''Cabiria'', claimed it was an ancient nickname for Hercules. According to William Smith's ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman mythology'', ''Macistus'' (Μάκιστος) was "A surname of Heracles, who had a temple in the neighbourhood of the town of Macistus in Triphylia."  A related name is ''Mecisteus'' (Μηκιστεύς), used of two different characters in mythology and also as a surname of Heracles. 

According to Maggie Günsberg in ''Italian Cinema: Gender and Genre'', d'Annunzio used two sources: one from ancient Greek, ''makistos'', meaning "longer," (but Italian ''macigno''; there is, however, no such word in Latin). In the first of the 1960s films, Maciste tells another character in the film that his name means "of the rock", and a later film, "Valley of the Thundering Echo", implies that Maciste magically materializes from out of the Earth itself when his abilities are needed.

==''Cabiria''==
Maciste made his debut in the 1914 Italian Roman princess from an evil Carthaginian king who plotted to sacrifice her to the cruel god Moloch.  The film was based very loosely on ''Salammbo'', a historical novel by Gustave Flaubert, and had a plot and screenplay by Gabriele d'Annunzio.

Maciste's debut set the tone for his later adventures. Typical plots involve tyrannical rulers who practice vile magical rituals or worship evil gods. Typically, the young lady who is the love interest runs afoul of the evil ruler. Maciste is a super-strong guy who must rescue her. There is often a rightful king out there somewhere who wants to overthrow the evil usurper. There is an obligatory belly dance scene. There is often an evil queen who has carnal designs on the hero. These films, then, could be set in settings from Mongolia to Peru, from Egypt to the Roman Empire. His life story, or his origin in ancient Carthage, did not prevent him from appearing in any setting from classical antiquity or modern times.

==Bartolomeo Pagano's Maciste films==
As a character, Maciste had two distinct moments in the spotlight. The first was in the Italian silent movie period, in which the original Maciste from ''Cabiria'', the muscular actor Bartolomeo Pagano, starred in a series of at least 26 sequels over the period from 1915 through 1926. Then decades later, (following on the heels of the success of the two 1950s Steve Reeves "Hercules" films) Maciste was revived for a series of 25 sound films (all made between 1960-1965).

The Bartolomeo Pagano silent Maciste films established the character as someone who could appear at any place and at any time.  Some of the earlier ones, made during Olympic athlete, in contemporary settings, or in the populist Hercules, using his physical prowess to overcome the evil ruses of effete aristocrats and authority figures.

==Revival of the 1960s==
The character was revived in the 1960s.  In 1958, Hercules'', an Italian production, created a minor boom in Italian dramas featuring American bodybuilders in vaguely mythological or classical historical subjects.  Maciste was the hero in 25 of these films.  Other films starred such heroes as Ursus, Samson, Hercules and Goliath. Maciste was never given an origin, and the source of his mighty powers was never revealed. Nor was he confined to one specific time period/setting since the films' settings moved freely from Biblical times to ancient Rome to the 1700s. This English versions of most of these films: when these films were imported into the USA and dubbed in English, the hero's name was often changed to Hercules, Atlas, or Colossus, because the name Maciste was not widely recognised in the USA.

Some Italian sword and sandal films were not theatrically released in the USA; they premiered on American television in a syndication package called ''Reg Lewis, Kirk Morris, Samson Burke, Alan Steel, Richard Lloyd, Renato Rossini and Frank Gordon.

==Influence of Maciste==
* Some authorities have made Maciste out to be a somewhat darker figure. The character is the enslaved embodiment of physical strength and vitality; as he travels to exotic locations, particularly in Oriental barbarism, as particularly embodied in the cult of Moloch that figured in the plot of ''Cabiria''.  It is certainly true that ''Cabiria'' tapped into Italy's celebration of its colonial adventure in Libya, and that Maciste appears as the ideal slave, always longing to be re-united with his Roman master.
* The ''Cabiria'' scene in which Maciste pushes a mill wheel for ten years seemingly inspired John Milius, who shot a similar one for his movie ''Conan the Barbarian''.
* director.  
* The 1960s adventures have been enjoyed mostly by devotees of camp style. Two of the films, ''Maciste contro i cacciatori di teste'' (translated as ''Colossus and the Head Hunters'') and ''Maciste e la regina di Samar'' (as ''Hercules against the Moon Men'') appeared on the comedy television program ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' in the 1990s.
