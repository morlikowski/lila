'''''Who Are You''''' is the eighth album by English rock band The Who. It was released in August 1978 on Polydor Records in the United Kingdom and on MCA Records in the United States. It peaked at Number 2 on the U.S. charts and Number 6 on the U.K. charts. It is The Who's last album with Keith Moon as the drummer. Moon died about two weeks after the release of this album.

''Who Are You'' was put out at a time when the two major camps of rock, strings. Moon's deteriorating health is reflected in some of the tracks; the alcohol and drug abuse had taken away from the frenzied drumming he was renowned for, but he delivered a powerhouse performance on the title track.

There was a three-year hiatus between ''Who Are You'' and The Who's previous album, ''The Who By Numbers''. The band was drifting apart during this period, due to the band members working on various solo projects, Moon sinking deeper into alcohol and drug abuse, and general exhaustion from the gruelling tour schedule the band had kept over the decade. Moon's health was especially an object of concern, as he only managed to come in during the last few weeks of recording and was unable to play in 6/8 time on the track "Music Must Change", so drums were removed completely from the track - only a few cymbal crashes were added.  Moon died just under a month after its release, and on the cover is shown sitting in a chair labeled "Not to be taken away". Moon is sitting backwards on the chair to hide his excessive weight gain over the past three months.

The album was a commercial success, going 2x platinum in the U.S. and peaking at Number 2 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart. The soundtrack to ''Grease'' prevented ''Who Are You'' from achieving Number 1 status in the U.S. The success of ''Who Are You'' generated excitement at the prospect of a new Who tour for the album. However, the album is surrounded by tragedy for Who fans due to Moon's death shortly after the album's release. The songs on the album were later performed on tour in 1979 when The Who reformed with drummer Kenney Jones and keyboardist John Bundrick.

'''''Who Are You''''' est un album du groupe 1978. 

C'est le dernier album studio du groupe avec le batteur Keith Moon, décédé en septembre de la même année.

==Conception==
Une péridode de trois ans s'est écoulée entre la conception des albums ''The Who By Numbers'' son successeur ''Who Are You''. Les quatre membres des Who préfèrent en effet se consacrer à leur carrière solo.

La santé de Keith Moon, déja éprouvée par les abus de drogue et d'alcool, ne lui permet déja plus de tenir toutes les dates de la tournée de 1978. En outre, il ne participe qu'aux dernières séances d'enregistrement de l'abum ''Who Are You'', sans arriver à jouer la ligne de batterie de "''Music Must Change''" (piste 5) en son entier (si bien qu'il n'y a plus du tout de batterie sur "''Music Must Change''", si ce n'est le son d'une cymbale à la fin).

Keith Moon meurt quelques mois plus tard, le 7 septembre 1978 d'une overdose de médicaments  pour traiter son alcoolisme.
