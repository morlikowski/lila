'''Kristal''' (veya '''billur'''), kimyadaki katı haldeki bir elementin veya bileşiğin, molekül, atom veya iyon yığınlarının (paketinin) kesin geometrik bir yapı göstermesi. Araştırmalar göstermiştir ki, hemen hemen bütün katı maddelerde atomlar tekrarlı bir sıra halinde dizilmiştir ve bundan dolayı billurlar teşkil ederler. Cam ve plastik başlıca istisnalardır. Bu maddelerde billurlaşma görülmez. Fakat bu maddelerde bile küçük bölgelerde parça parça bir tekrarlı sıra bulunur.

Billur maddeler; metaller, mücevherler taşları ve tuzlardan toz taneciklerine kadar geniş bir dağılım gösterirler. Bununla beraber her birinin atomları sıralı bir tarzda dizilmiştir. Billur sıranın detaylı tabiatı yani billur yapısı, billuru teşkil eden maddenin özelliği olarak herbirinde farklıdır. Bir billur, yüzeyleri arasındaki açının gösterdiği temel yapıları ile tanınır ve başlıca yedi yapıya ayrılır: 
# Triklinik, 
# Monoklinik, 
# Ortorombik, 
# Trigonal (Comboedral), 
# Hekzagonal, 
# Tetragonal, 
# Kubik. 
Bu yedi billur yapısı da kendi içinde 32 billur sınıfına; bu da yine kendi içinde 230 gruba ayrılmıştır.

Bazı maddeler birden fazla billur çeşidi meydana getirir ki, buna o maddenin Allotropları denir.

In chemistry, mineralogy, and materials science, a '''crystal''' is a solid in which the constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating pattern extending in all three spatial dimensions.

The word ''crystal'' is a loan from the ancient Greek word κρύσταλλος (''krustallos''), which had the same meaning, but according to the ancient understanding of crystal. At root it means anything congealed by freezing, such as ''ice''.<ref>.</ref> The word once referred particularly to quartz, or "rock crystal". 
 
Most metals encountered in everyday life are  polycrystals. Crystals are often symmetrically intergrown to form crystal twins.

The process of forming a crystalline structure from a fluid or from materials dissolved in the fluid is often referred to as '''crystallization'''. In the ancient example referenced by the root meaning of the word crystal, water being cooled undergoes a phase change from liquid to solid beginning with small ice crystals that grow until they fuse, forming a polycrystalline structure. The physical properties of the ice depend on the size and arrangement of the individual crystals, or grains, and the same may be said of metals solidifying from a molten state.

Which ambient pressure. While the cooling process usually results in the lattice sites before they lose mobility. A noncrystalline material, which has no viscous controversial topic.
 

Crystalline structures occur in all classes of materials, with all types of metal exists in a polycrystalline state; amorphous or single-crystal metals must be produced synthetically, often with great difficulty. Ionically bonded crystals can form upon solidification of salts, either from a molten fluid or when it condenses from a solution. Covalently bonded crystals are also very common, notable examples being diamond, silica, and graphite. Polymer materials generally will form crystalline regions, but the lengths of the molecules usually prevent complete crystallization. Weak Van der Waals forces can also play a role in a crystal structure; for example, this type of bonding loosely holds together the hexagonal-patterned sheets in graphite.

Most crystalline materials have a variety of crystallographic defects. The types and structures of these defects can have a profound effect on the properties of the materials.

==Crystal phases or forms==
Polymorphism is the ability of a solid to exist in more than one crystal form.  For example, water Ice I<sub>h</sub>, but can also exist as the cubic Ice I<sub>c</sub>, the rhombohedral ice II, and many other forms. 

Amorphous phases are also possible with the same molecule, such as amorphous ice.  In this case, the phenomenon is known as polyamorphism.

For pure chemical elements, polymorphism is known as allotropy.  For example, diamond, graphite, and fullerenes are different allotropes of carbon.

Since the initial discovery of crystal-like individual arrays of atoms that are not regularly repeated, made in 1982 by position space to Fourier space. Within the family of crystals one distinguishes between traditional crystals, which are periodic, or repeating, at the atomic scale, and aperiodic crystals which are not. This broader definition adopted in 1996 reflects the current understanding that microscopic periodicity is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for crystals.,

While the term "crystal" has a precise meaning within Snowflakes, diamonds, and common salt are common examples of crystals.

Some crystalline materials may exhibit special electrical properties such as the piezoelectric effect. Additionally, refracted or bent in different directions, producing an array of colors; crystal optics is the study of these effects. In periodic dielectric structures a range of unique optical properties can be expected as seen in photonic crystals.

Crystallography is the scientific study of crystals and crystal formation.
