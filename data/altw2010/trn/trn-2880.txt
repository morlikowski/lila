'''Dru Hill''' is an American singing group, most popular during the late 1990s, whose repertoire included R&B, soul, and Tamir "Nokio" Ruffin was the group's founder and leader; his bandmates included main lead singer Mark "Sisqó" Andrews, James "Woody Rock" Green. Signing to Island Records through Haqq Islam's University Records imprint, Dru Hill released two successful LPs before separating for a period from late 1999 to 2002, during which time Sisqó and Woody released solo albums. While Woody's ''Soul Music'' LP was a moderate success in the gospel music industry, Sisqó's ''Unleash the Dragon'' LP and its hit single "Thong Song" were major pop successes, and established Sisqó as a household name outside of Dru Hill.

In 2002, by then part of the Def Soul record label, the group reunited and added fifth member Rufus "Scola" Waller to the lineup for their third LP, ''Dru World Order''.

==History==
===Formation===
All four original members of Dru Hill were natives of Baltimore, Maryland. Mark Andrews and James Green met each other in middle school, and both later became acquaintances of Tamir Ruffin when all three began pursuing careers in the music industry. Ruffin, nicknamed "Nokio" (an acronym for "Nasty on Key in Octave") enlisted Andrews and Green (whose respective nicknames of "Sisqó" and "Woody" came from their childhood) to form a singing group. The trio added Larry "Jazz" Anthony, an opera student, to complete their lineup. The group was named after Druid Hill Park, a popular park on the West side of Baltimore, the name of which is pronounced "Dru Hill" in the local accent.

The quartet made a name for itself by getting jobs at a local fudge factory, "The Fudgery," at the Inner Harbor, where they sang to entertain guests while making the candy. Most of their early repertoire was made up of gospel music; the group eventually switched to the more commercially viable genre of R&B.

===Big break and ''Dru Hill''===
left|thumb|200px|Dru Hill's 1996 eponymous debut, ''[[Dru Hill (album)|Dru Hill''.]]
Dru Hill's big break came in 1996, when Dru Hill'' album was released on gold-selling album. The group's first single, "Tell Me", was featured on the soundtrack to the Whoopi Goldberg film ''Eddie'', and was a Top 5 R&B hit in the United States.

Stylistically, Dru Hill was the middle-ground between the smooth, gentlemen-like Boyz II Men and the self-proclaimed "bad boys of R&B", Jodeci. Dru Hill received a lot of criticism, especially from the members of Jodeci, for what was perceived was a direct appropriation of Jodeci's style, particularly in frontman Sisqó's K-Ci Hailey-esque lead vocals. Other major influences for the group included Stevie Wonder and 1980s boy band New Edition.

Both the group themselves and producers such as Daryl Simmons and Keith Sweat wrote the songs for the ''Dru Hill'' album, with the group themselves writing the single "5 Steps". Nokio also did some co-production, and would become the group's main producer by 1998.

All four members took turns singing lead, with Sisqó making the biggest impression on audiences with his dancing style, child molestation.

===Soundtracks, protégés, and controversy===
Between their first and second albums, Dru Hill contributed "We're Not Making Love No More", a #2 R&B and #13 Pop hit, to the ''Soul Food'' soundtrack. "We're Not Making Love No More" was written and produced by star producer Foxy Brown recorded "Big Bad Mama", a remake of Carl Carlton's 1981 hit "She's a Bad Mama Jama (She's Built, She's Stacked)", which was the main single for the soundtrack to the 1998 Mya, whose first two singles "It's All About Me" and "Movin' On", were co-written by Sisqó, who also performs guest vocals on "It's All About Me".

In 1997, Dru Hill filed a lawsuit against Island Records, seeking a release from its contract, after an Island employee hit the group's manager, Keith Ingram, over the head with a pool cue. <ref>Brown, Ann (March 1998).

At an October 1997 deposition hearing, Eric Kronfeld, president and chief operating officer of Island's parent company PolyGram, was asked why he had hired such an individual.

===''Enter the Dru''===
right|thumb|200px|Dru Hill's second album, ''[[Enter the Dru''.]]
Dru Hill's second Top 5 pop hit came in the form of 1998's "How Deep is Your Love" (Pop #3), a hip hop styled track which was included on the soundtrack to the Rush Hour''. The single,"This Is What We Do" featuring a guest rap from Method Man, set the tone for the group's second LP, ''Enter the Dru''. The album featured several other mid-tempo tracks in the vein of "How Deep", as well as the R&B Top 5 single "These are the Times" (Pop #21), co-written and co-produced by Babyface.

''Enter the Dru'' eventually sold two million copies by 1999.<ref name="RIAA-certification" /> That year, Dru Hill recorded a version of "Enchantment Passing Through" for the soundtrack to the Broadway musical ''Aida''.

===The Dru World Order project===
Among the press and the public, Sisqó was singled out as a de-facto solo act, and the other three members were regarded as sidemen. When Dru Hill made a high-profile guest appearance on Wild Wild West", the lead single from the soundtrack to Smith's 1999 film of the same name, it made a star out of Sisqó alone. Both the song and its video prominently featured Sisqó alongside Smith, with the other three members relegated to the background.

During the "Wild Wild West" video shoot in April 1999, Woody quit the group, feeling a need to return to his gospel music roots. At first, Island decided to keep Dru Hill a trio, and shot a video for a hip-hop-styled remix of ''Enter the Dru's'' "You are Everything" with only Sisqó, Jazz, and Nokio, who performs a rap with Def Jam artist Case was subsequently enlisted to sing backgrounds on a remix of "Beauty" from ''Enter the Dru'', whose video was shot but not released.

After Island merged with Def Jam to become Def Soul, creating what was termed the "Dru World Order" project. Between November 1999 and November 2000, each member would release a solo album: Sisqó a pop album, Jazz a traditional R&B/soul album, Nokio a hip hop album, and Woody a gospel album. All four members would then reunite and record ''Dru World Order'', a new Dru Hill album to be released in November 2000.

Sisqó released his debut ''novelty record entitled "Incomplete", became a number-one hit during the fall. As a result, the Dru World Order project schedule was continually pushed back, and, by November 2000, none of the other solo albums had been released.

In the early fall of 2000, Def Soul had Dru Hill re-enter the studio to record the ''Dru World Order'' album, and the song "Without Me" was chosen as the lead single. However, the time the group had spent apart created tension and conflict: Sisqó walked out of a November 2000 Dru Hill photo shoot for ''VIBE'' magazine, and the group broke apart completely shortly afterward.

''Dru World Order'' was placed on indefinite hold, and Sisqó began work on a second solo LP, ''Return of Dragon''. "Without You" was issued as an album track on ''Return of Dragon'', which performed below expectations after its June 2001 release. By the end of the year, Sisqó and Nokio had begun plans to reassemble Dru Hill, enlisting Baltimore associate Rufus Waller, who performed under the name "Scola", as a fifth member.
