'''Camp Randall Stadium''' is an outdoor stadium in Madison, collegiate athletics. It is the oldest and fourth largest stadium in the Big Ten Conference.

The stadium received its name because it lies on the grounds of Camp Randall, a former Union Army training camp during the American Civil War. The camp was named after Governor Alexander Randall, who was also a United States Postmaster General.

Originally, the stadium consisted of a horseshoe opening to the south, with a running track around the field.  The stadium was renovated at various points to raise the size of the horseshoe by nearly doubling the number of rows around the stadium in stages, placing south stands in front of the Wisconsin Field House (built in 1930), the removal of the track and addition of nearly 11,000 seats in 1958, the addition of the upper deck in 1966, and finally the 2005 addition of boxes along the eastern rim of the stadium.

The field was originally natural grass, and was one of the first in the United States to convert to artificial turf, in 1968.  A new AstroTurf field was installed in 1990.  An artificial grass field, FieldTurf, was installed for the 2003 season.

The stadium also houses athletic offices of the university. In 2002, a large-scale reconstruction project commenced, which added luxury boxes, a five-story office building, separate football program offices, and expanded seating. In addition, concessions, restrooms and other infrastructure items were upgraded, the walkway around the field was removed, and new scoreboards were installed. The construction was completed prior to the start of the 2005 season. The football team continued to play at the stadium throughout the construction.

The numbers of Wisconsin's two Heisman Trophy winners, Alan Ameche and Ron Dayne, are displayed on the upper deck façade.  Both of their numbers (35 and 33, respectively) are retired;  The retired numbers of Elroy Hirsch (40), Dave Schreiner (80), Allan Schafer (83), and Pat Richter (88) were added during the 2006 football season.

At Barry Alvarez's final game as head coach in 2005, plans were announced to place a statue of him in the Stadium's Kellner Plaza.  The bronze statue was unveiled on 13 October 2006.  On 17 November, it was joined by a similar statue of former UW athlete and athletic director Pat Richter. [http://www.uwbadgers.com/sport_news/gs/headlines/story.html?sportid=200&storyid=9382]

=="The Camp Randall Crush"==
On Michigan Wolverines 13-10.  As the final gun sounded, students began to charge the field to celebrate, but were blocked by the guardrails surrounding the field.  The crowd in the back, not fully aware of what was going on at the front, continued to move forward, now being aided by gravity.  As a result, those up front got caught and were pressed against the rails, and then were trampled as the throng spilled onto the field.  73 students were injured, six of them critically.  Several Badgers football players assisted with removing the injured from the tangle. Per Mar Security (stadium security) and the University of Wisconsin were later found liable for this situation. 

As a result, design changes were made in the stadium which increased the size and strength of the fences.

==Off the Field Traditions==
The Badger Football events at Camp Randall Stadium are more than a Game: There are numerous traditions that were founded here and have become staples to Badger fans around the world.

'''The Fifth Quarter'''

In 1969, The Badgers had lost 24 straight games, and Wisconsin Marching Band.  Working with Athletic director, Elroy Hirsch, Leckrone and the Band created a fan event that would take place after the game, the "Fifth Quarter".  

Normally played during the Fifth Quarter are songs such as "Tequila", "Hey Baby", and much more.  Thousands of spectators remain in the stands for fifteen minutes after the game in order to enjoy the performance.

At the end of the Fifth Quarter, the band lines up once more to play "Varsity", as the spectators sing.  The band then exits the field to the north entrance to perform a little more and sing "It's Hard to Be Humble", after which the band marches to the Humanities building, where they are dismissed.

The Fifth Quarter was officially named in 1978, and its traditions have been passed down through the last three decades. About 10 years ago, according to Leckrone, any freshman who didn't know the rituals before they entered the university, were indoctrinated with them at a special orientation run by Leckrone before the first game.   Now almost everyone learns quickly from their friends who grew up with the Badgers.

'''The Wave'''

Badger stadium has taken the traditional Wave to a whole new level.   This goes beyond standing up and raising your hands in the air.
