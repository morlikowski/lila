A '''spear''' is a pole weapon used for hunting and war, consisting of a shaft, usually of wood, with a sharpened head. The head may be simply the sharpened end of the shaft itself, as is the case with bamboo spears, or it may be of another material fastened to the shaft, such as obsidian or bronze. The most common design is of a metal spearhead, shaped like a triangle or a leaf.

Spears were one of the most common personal weapons from the late Bronze Age until the advent of pike. One of the earliest weapons fashioned by human beings and their ancestors, it is still used for hunting and fishing, and its influences can still be seen in contemporary military arsenals as the rifle-mounted bayonet.

Spears can be used as both melee and ballistic weapons. Spears used primarily for thrusting tend to have heavier and sturdier designs than those intended exclusively for throwing. Two of the most noted throwing spears are the javelin thrown by the ancient Greeks and the Romans.

== History ==
Spear manufacture and use is also practiced by the ''Pan troglodytes verus'' subspecies of the Common Chimpanzee.  Chimpanzees near Kédougou, Senegal were observed to create spears by breaking straight limbs off of trees, stripping them of their bark and side branches, and sharpening one end with their teeth. They then used the weapons to hunt galagos sleeping in hollows.<ref name=Pruetz1>Jill D.

Archeological evidence documents that wooden spears were used for hunting 400,000 years ago.<ref>Lower Palaeolithic hunting spears from Germany. Hartmut Thieme. Letters to Nature. Nature 385, 807 - 810 (27 February 1997); doi:10.1038/385807a0 [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v385/n6619/abs/385807a0.html]</ref> However, wood does not preserve well.  Craig Stanford, a primatologist and professor of anthropology at the University of Southern California, has suggested that the discovery of spear use by chimpanzees probably means that early humans used wooden spears as well, perhaps five million years ago.<ref>Rick Weiss, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/22/AR2007022201007.html "Chimps Observed Making Their Own Weapons"], ''The Washington Post'', February 22, 2007</ref>

By 250,000 years ago wooden spears were made with fire-hardened points. From 80,000 years ago humans began to make complex stone blades, which were used as spear points. By 50,000 years ago there was a revolution in human culture, leading to more complex hunting techniques.

== Usefulness ==
The utility and longevity of the spear as a universal personal weapon rises from several factors, including versatility, cost efficiency, ease of use and effect.

A spear was a relatively low cost weapon or tool compared to other weapons available in pre-industrial societies.  In this period, when metals and the ability to work them were expensive, the spear was seen as "cost effective".  The steel required for a sword, for example, would be sufficient to make several spear heads.  A spear not only takes less metal, but does not require the same quality of material, the same amount of time, or the same level of skill to manufacture; the result is still a weapon of potentially lethal effect. 

A spear is relatively easy to use. Again, in comparison with other weapons in the periods of the spear's widest use, a spear requires less training and practice to wield effectively (though not necessarily expertly), notably for formation use since its thrusting techniques minimize disruption to teammates on either side. Modern experiments by reenactors have shown that a group of people can be trained to use spears in an effective shield wall as militia in a few weeks of part-time training. 

Spears vary greatly in function depending upon the length of the shaft, weight of the point, and location of the grip. Short spears, like those developed by the Zulu, were used for single combat in close proximity. Most short and mid-length spears were also used for throwing; in fact, the Roman pilum was specifically built to stick in and foul a target's shield. Greek long pikes, on the other hand, were used in large battle formations, called phalanges (sg. phalanx), to keep the opponent at a distance. With the rise of heavily armored knights in the medieval age, spear shafts began to be reinforced to be planted against the ground and halt charging cavalry. The lance, a form of spear gripped at the base and wielded with one hand, was also developed to be used from horseback. Though cavalry spears had been used before, the lance was made popular by the medieval sport of jousting.

In addition to being a cheap, relatively easy to wield weapon that could be quickly manufactured and used in large numbers, often at a considerable distance from the target, a spear in experienced hands is fast and lethal.

== Spear Handling ==
Spears, although apparently simple weapons, have a remarkable variety of wielding methods.  Some are listed here from most passive to most active motions.
#Holding the spear or bracing it against the ground, the enemy impales himself.
#The spear is thrust out with the arms alone.
#The spear is held stiffly, and the thrust is delivered by stepping forward.
#The spear is thrust out with the arms while stepping forward with one or both feet.
#The front hand releases as the back hand and back foot move forward to perform a long thrust.
#The spear is slid through the front hand, propelled by the back hand.  The forward foot steps forward and the back circles the body out of the line of thrust.
#The spear is thrown, often at a run, releasing when the opposite foot to the throwing arm is forward.
#The spear is held couched under one arm, allowing a swinging motion as well as a powerful thrust.
#The spear is swung, causing the tip of the blade to slice open the foe's flesh. The spear can then be brought around in a stabbing motion.

This versatility led to the continued use of spears, in the form of pikes, for many years even after the invention of firearms.

== Symbolism ==

More than a weapon, a spear may be a Chinese spear (Qiang 槍) is popularly known as the "king of weapons". In submitting to an enemy.  The Celts would symbolically destroy a dead warrior's spear to prevent their use by another.

swords, while the elite triarii who formed the final line fought with spears. 

ashwood, made from the "World-Tree" Yggdrasil, and it may be remarkable that Chiron's wedding-gift to Peleus when he married the nymph Thetis at a wedding attended by all the Olympians, was an ashen spear (although this could be coincidental, as the nature of ashwood with its straight grain made it an ideal choice of wood for a spear). 

Also in Greek Mythology Zeus' bolts of lightning can be interpreted as a symbolic spear, and some would carry that into the spear that is frequently associated with Athena, interpreting her spear as a symbolic connection to some of Zeus' power beyond the Aegis.

Another spear of religious significance was the Spear of Destiny, an artifact believed by some to have vast mystical powers.

Sir James George Frazer in ''The Golden Bough'' noted the phallic nature of the spear and suggested that in the Arthurian Legends the spear or lance functioned as a symbol of male fertility, paired with the Grail (as a symbol of female fertility).

Der '''Speer''' (auch Wurfspieß) ist eine zu den Wurf- und Stichwaffe und eine der ältesten der von Menschen verwendeten Waffen. An einer Stange, dem Schaft, ist eine Spitze (oft zweischneidige Klinge) aus unterschiedlichen Materialien (angespitzte Steine, Knochen, Eisen, Stahl) angebracht. Speere waren üblicherweise als Wurfwaffen gedacht oder als Mehrzweckwaffen, die sowohl im Fern- als auch im Nahkampf eingesetzt wurden. Sie sind normalerweise kürzer und leichter als Spieße welche nicht geworfen werden. 

Heute ist der Speer, von wenigen Ausnahmen abgesehen, in erster Linie ein Sportgerät, bei Naturvölkern jedoch immer noch eine wichtige Jagdwaffe. 

Eine Verbesserung von Reichweite, Durchschlagskraft und Zielgenauigkeit des Speeres wird durch die Speerschleuder erreicht, diese ist seit ca. 13.000 Jahren belegt. 

Um zielgenau geworfen zu werden, muss der Speer ausbalancierter sein, damit er immer mit der Spitze voraus im Ziel aufkommt. Nachdem unter Berücksichtigung der Wurfbahn auf ein Ziel gezielt wurde, wird der Speer geworfen. Beim Wurf ins Wasser, etwa zum Fischfang, ist die Lichtbrechung mit zu berücksichtigen. Mit modernen Sportspeeren lassen sich Wurfweiten von 100 Meter erreichen, aber die effektive Reichtweite von Jagd- und Kriegsspeeren lag unter 20 Metern.

Manche Speere, wie das römische Schilden gezogen werden, und machten diesen unbrauchbar. Zudem wurde die Gefahr des Zurückwerfens des Speeres unterbunden.

==Geschichte==
Die ältesten Speere, die bis jetzt weltweit gefunden wurden, die sog. Schöninger Speere, sind nach neuesten Erwägungen wohl um die 270.000 Jahre alt <ref>O.

Ausstellungskatalog Blaubeuren (2005), S. 47-70.</ref>, wobei ihre Zuordnung zu einer bestimmten Menschenform noch unklar ist.

Die Waffe wurde durchgehend bis zum Erscheinen der Griechen durch Römern als Frame, Ger.

Im Mittelalter ging der Einsatz des Speeres zurück, weil die neuen Entwicklungen Langbogen und Armbrust eine ähnliche Rolle erfüllten.

Noch im 19. Jahrhundert setzten die Zulu in Südafrika Wurfspeere ein, den so genannten ''assegai''. Napoléon Eugène Louis Bonaparte wurde im Zulukrieg in Südafrika am 1. Juni 1879 durch diese Waffe getötet.
