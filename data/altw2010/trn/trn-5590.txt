Alors qu'elle n'a que deux ans, son père et sa mère décident d'émigrer aux États-Unis. Ils s'installent alors dans le quartier du Bronx à New York.

Ensemble, ils créent un premier album en 1991, puis un second, recueil de poèmes chantés en 1993, qui la rend célèbre en Israël.
Peu de temps après, Achinoam Nini et Gil Dor rencontrent le célèbre guitariste Pat Metheny qui co-produit l'album '''Noa'''. C'est le premier album diffusé dans le monde entier. C'est le début de la carrière internationale d'Achinoam Nini.
En 1997, l'auteur Luc Plamondon et le compositeur Richard Cocciante lui demandent de tenir le rôle de la bohémienne Esmeralda dans leur nouvelle comédie musicale adaptée de l’œuvre de Notre-Dame de Paris. Elle accepte et interprètera 3 chansons sur l'album studio original vendu à plus de 2 millions d'exemplaires en France et devenant ainsi le 13 album le plus vendu en France. Mais malgré l'immense succès de l'album, Noa ne pourra pas interpréter le rôle sur scène au Palais des Congrès et sera donc remplacée par Hélène Ségara.

Très engagée dans la lutte contre la faim, elle devient ambassadrice de l'ONU contre la faim.
