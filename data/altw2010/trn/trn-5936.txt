'''''"Heroes"''''' (the quotation marks are part of the title, for reasons of irony)<ref></ref> is an album by Low'' and ''Lodger'') ''"Heroes"'' developed the sound of ''Low'' in a more positive direction.<ref> </ref> Of the three albums, it was the most befitting of the appellation "Berlin", being the only one wholly recorded there. The title track remains one of Bowie's best known, a classic story of two lovers who meet at the ''NME'' Album of the Year. 

== Production and style ==
Recorded at NEU! '75'' by the German band Trans-Europe Express''. The cover photo was inspired by The Idiot'', one of Bowie's collaborations with Iggy Pop that was released the same year.<ref></ref>

Though ''"Heroes"'' included a number of dark and atmospheric instrumentals such as "Blackout", after the melancholy and inward-looking ''Low'' it was regarded as a highly passionate and positive artistic statement.<ref name="Strange Fascination"/><ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/> This was evident not only through "Heroes" the song but in the rocking opener "Beauty and the Beast" (released as the second single in January 1978), the raucous "Joe the Lion" and the light-hearted closer "The Secret Life of Arabia". The lyrics for "Joe the Lion", written and recorded at the microphone "in less than an hour" according to Visconti, typified the improvisational nature of the recording.<ref></ref>

== Release and aftermath ==
''"Heroes"'' was marketed by RCA with the catch phrase, "There’s Old Wave. There’s New Wave. And there's David Bowie..."<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"></ref> It enjoyed a positive critical reception on release in late 1977,<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/> ''Melody Maker'' and ''NME'' both naming it 'Album of the Year'.<ref name="Loving the Alien"/><ref></ref> It made #3 in the UK and stayed in the charts for 26 weeks, but was less successful in the U.S. where it peaked at #35.

A number of the album's tracks were played live at Bowie's concerts the following year, captured on record as ''Stage'' (1978). classical suite, ''"Heroes" Symphony'', based on this album, a companion to his earlier ''Low Symphony''. The title track has been covered by numerous artists, and has been frequently used as an encore by recent incarnations of British Electric Foundation LP ''Music of Quality and Distinction''.
