'''''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial''''' is a 1982 Dee Wallace and alien, dubbed "E.T.", who is stranded on Earth. Elliott and his siblings help the alien return home while attempting to keep it hidden from their mother and the government.

The concept for ''E.T.'' came from an imaginary friend Spielberg created after his parents' divorce. When work on ''Night Skies'' stalled, Spielberg met screenwriter Melissa Mathison, whom he hired to pen the script for ''E.T.'' The film was shot from September to December 1981 in California on a budget of US $10.5 million. Unlike most motion pictures, the film was shot in roughly chronological order, to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast.

Released by  blockbuster, surpassing ''Star Wars'' to become the most financially successful film released to that point. Critics acclaimed it as a timeless story of friendship, ranking it as best science fiction film ever made in a ''Rotten Tomatoes'' poll. The alien became the subject of analogies for Jesus. The film was rereleased in 1985, and in 2002 with altered special effects and additional scenes. Spielberg believes ''E.T.'' epitomizes his work.<ref></ref> 

==Plot==
The film opens in a alien botanists collect vegetation samples. U.S. government agents appear and the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving one of their own behind in their haste. The scene shifts to a suburban California home, where a boy named Elliott plays servant to his older brother, Michael, and his friends. As he fetches pizza, Elliott discovers the stranded alien, who promptly flees. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves Reese's Pieces candy in the forest to lure it into his bedroom. Before he goes to bed, Elliott notices the alien imitating his movements. 

Elliott feigns illness the next morning to avoid school so he can play with the alien. That afternoon, Michael and their younger sister, Gertie, meet the alien. Their mother, Mary, hears the noise and comes upstairs. Michael, Gertie, and the alien hide in the closet while Elliott reassures her everything is all right. Michael and Gertie promise to keep the alien a secret from their mother. Deciding to keep the alien, the children begin to ask it about its origin. It answers by levitating balls to represent its Coors beer and he begins freeing all the frogs from a dissection class. As the alien watches John Wayne kiss Maureen O'Hara in ''The Quiet Man'', Elliott's psychic link causes him to kiss a girl he likes in the same manner.

The alien learns to speak English by repeating what Gertie says in response to her watching ''Speak & Spell. Michael starts to notice that E.T.'s health is declining and that Elliott is referring to himself as "we". On Halloween, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so they can sneak it out of the house. Elliott and E.T. ride a bicycle to the forest, where E.T. makes a successful call home. The next morning, Elliott wakes up to find E.T. gone, and returns home to his distressed family. Michael finds E.T. dying in the forest, and takes him to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, before government agents invade the house.

Scientists set up a medical facility in the house, quarantining Elliott and E.T. The link between E.T. and Elliott disappears as E.T. appears to die. Elliott is left alone with the motionless alien when he notices a dead flower, the plant E.T. had previous revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that its people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining Elliott and E.T.'s bicycled evasion of the authorities. Suddenly facing a dead-end, they escape as E.T.'s telekinesis lifts them into the air and toward the forest. E.T. stands near the spaceship, his heart glowing as he readies to return home. Mary, Gertie and Keys, a government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, and before entering the spaceship, tells Elliott "I'll be right here," pointing its glowing finger to Elliott's forehead.

After his parents' divorce in 1960, Spielberg filled the void with an imaginary alien companion.

The project was set aside because of delays on ''1941'', but the concept of making a small autobiographical film about childhood would stay with Spielberg.<ref name=brode></ref> He also thought about a follow-up to ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', and began to develop a darker project he had planned with John Sayles called ''Night Skies'' in which malevolent aliens terrorize a family.<ref name=brode/>

''E.T.'' began shooting in September 1981.<ref name="exceptional"></ref> The project was filmed under the title ''A Boy's Life'' to keep production a secret, as Spielberg did not want anyone to discover and plagiarize the plot. The actors had to read the script behind closed doors, and everyone on set had to wear an ID card.<ref name="starry"/> The shoot began with two days at a high school in Northridge and Tujunga.<ref name=brode/> The next forty-two days were spent at Laird International Studios in Culver City, for the interiors of Elliott's home. The crew shot at a redwood forest near Crescent City for the last six days of production.<ref name=brode/><ref name="mcbride"/> Spielberg shot the film in roughly chronological order to achieve convincingly emotional performances from his cast. In the scene when Michael first encounters the alien, the creature's appearance caused MacNaughton to jump back and knock down the shelves behind him. The chronological shoot gave the young actors an emotional experience as they bonded with E.T., making the hospital sequences more moving.<ref name="reunion"/> Spielberg ensured the puppeteers kept away from the set to maintain the illusion of a real alien.

Longtime Spielberg collaborator score for ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial''. Williams described his challenge on this project as creating a score that would create sympathy for an odd-looking creature like E.T. As with their previous collaborations, Spielberg liked every theme Williams composed and had it included. Spielberg loved the music for the final chase so much that he edited the sequence to suit it.<ref></ref>

==Themes==
Spielberg drew the story of ''E.T.'' from the divorce of his own parents;<ref name="salon">Charles Taylor. [http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/feature/2002/03/22/et/index.html "You can go home again."] Salon.com (March 22, 2002).</ref> Gary Arnold of the ''Washington Post'' called the film "essentially a spiritual autobiography, a portrait of the filmmaker as a typical suburban kid set apart by an uncommonly fervent, mystical imagination."<ref name="arnold">Gary Arnold. "E.T. Steven Spielberg's Joyful Excursion, Back to Childhood, Forward to the Unknown." ''Washington Post'' (June 6, 1982), G1.</ref> Reflections of Steven Spielberg's childhood are seen throughout: Elliott feigns illness by holding his thermometer to a light bulb while covering his face with a heating pad, which was a trick frequently employed by the young Spielberg.<ref></ref> Michael's picking on Elliott echoes Spielberg's teasing of his younger sisters,<ref name="20edition"/> and Michael's evolution from tormentor to protector reflects how Spielberg had to take care of his sisters after their father left.<ref name="reunion"/>

Critics have focused on the parallels between the life of E.T. and Elliott, who is "alienated" by the loss of his father.<ref name="sebeok">Thomas A. Sebeok. "Enter Textuality: Echoes from the Extra-Terrestrial." In ''Poetics Today'' (1985), Porter Institute for Poetics and Semiotics. Published by Duke University Press.</ref><ref name="back">Ilsa J. Beck, "The Look Back in E.T.," ''Cinema Journal'' 31(4) (1992): 25-41, 33.</ref>  ''New York Times'' film critic A.O. Scott wrote that while E.T. "is the more obvious and desperate foundling," Elliott "suffers in his own way from the want of a home."<ref name="aoscott"></ref> At the film's heart is the theme of growing up. Critic Henry Sheehan described the film as a retelling of Peter Pan from the perspective of a Lost Boy (Elliott).<ref name="sheehan"></ref> E.T. cannot survive physically on Earth, as Pan could not survive emotionally in Neverland; Neverland’s pirates are replaced by government scientists.<ref name="sheehan"/> Some critics have suggested that Spielberg's portrayal of suburbia is very dark, contrary to popular belief. A.O. Scott said, "The suburban milieu, with its unsupervised children and unhappy parents, its broken toys and brand-name junk food, could have come out of a Raymond Carver story",<ref name="aoscott"/> and Charles Taylor of Salon.com said, "Spielberg's movies, despite the way they're often characterized, are not Hollywood idealizations of families and the suburbs. The homes here bear what the cultural critic Karal Ann Marling called 'the marks of hard use.'"<ref name="salon"/>

thumb|190px|Spielberg admitted this scene triggered speculation as to whether the film was a religious parable.<ref name="take 22"></ref>
Other critics found religious parallels between E.T. and Jesus Christ.<ref></ref><ref>Anton Karl Kozlovic.

"Tidings of comfort and joy." ''Financial Times'' (December 10, 1982), I11</ref> According to Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride, Universal Studios appealed directly to the Christian market, with a poster reminiscent of Michelangelo's ''Creation of Adam'' and a logo reading "Peace".<ref name="mcbride"/> Spielberg answered that he did not intend the film to be a religious parable, joking, "If I ever went to my mother and said, 'Mom, I've made this movie that's a Christian parable,' what do you think she'd say? She has a kosher restaurant on Pico and Doheny in Los Angeles."<ref name="take 22"/>

As a substantial body of film criticism has built up around ''E.T.'', numerous writers have analyzed the film in other ways as well.  E.T. has been analyzed as a modern fairy tale<ref name="gordon"/> and in psychoanalytic terms.<ref name="gordon">Andrew Gordon. "E.T. as a Fairy Tale," ''Science Fiction Studies'' 10 (1983): 298-305.</ref><ref name="back"/> Producer Kathleen Kennedy noted that an important theme of ''E.T.'' is tolerance, which would be central to future Spielberg films such as ''Schindler's List''.<ref name="20edition"/> Having been a loner as a teenager, Spielberg described the film as "a minority story".<ref></ref> Spielberg's common theme of communication is partnered with the ideal of common understanding as represented in his depiction of humans and aliens: he asks that if an alien and a human can become friends, so too can many enemies who live close to one another on Earth.<ref></ref>
