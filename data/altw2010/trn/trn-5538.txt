'''Alu Dadaschewitsch Alchanow''' (kyrillisch ''Алу Дадашевич Алханов''; * Russischen Föderation.

Alchanows Eltern wurden, wie alle anderen Tschetschenen von Stalin 1944 brutal aus Chruschtschow kehrte die Familie zurück nach Tschetschenien und siedelte in Urus-Matan an.

Alchanow war früher Polizeioffizier, dann Polizeigeneral und bis zum Tode des ermordeten Präsidenten Achmed Kadyrow seit April 2004 Innenminister. Als russische Truppen 1995 die Hauptstadt Grosny von den tschetschenischen Separatisten eroberten, übernahm Alchanow die Leitung der Bahnpolizei. Beim Gegenangriff der Rebellen 1996 verteidigte er mit seinen Leuten den Bahnhof von Grosny – eine „Heldentat“, die von russischen Medien oft erzählt wird. 

Im August 2004 wird er mit rund 74 Prozent der Stimmen zum Präsidenten des Landes gewählt. Internationale Wahlbeobachter bezeichnen die Wahl als undemokratisch. Alchanow ist, im Gegensatz zu anderen Politikern des Landes, immer auf Seiten Moskaus gewesen.

Angeblich trug Alchanow immer seine Dienstpistole bei sich, selbst im Gespräch mit Delegierten des Europarates. Insgesamt zwölf Anschläge wurden in den vergangenen vier Jahren auf den jeweiligen Präsidenten Tschetscheniens verübt.

'''Alu Dadashevich Alkhanov''' was the president of Russia's Chechen Republic. 

Alkhanov is a career police officer who fought within the ranks of the Russian army during the First Chechen War. He was elected president on August 30, 2004, under controversial circumstances. On February 15, 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Alkhanov as the Chechen President and appointed him a Deputy Justice Minister of Russia. 

==Biography==
Born in Kazakhstan on January 20, 1957, Alkhanov joined the Soviet Army on leaving school. He joined the Soviet Militsiya service in[1983, graduating from the transport police school in Mogilev (now Mahilyow in Belarus). He went onto the High Police School in Rostov-on-Don before becoming Deputy Head of the North Caucasus Transport Department of the former Chechen-Ingushetia government in Grozny in 1992. He was later promoted to head the department, a post which he held until 1997. 

When the First Chechen War broke out in 1994, Alkhanov supported the Russian side against the separatists. He was decorated with the Order of Courage for his actions during the separatists' assault on Grozny in 1996. In April 2003, he was appointed Interior Minister of Chechnya in the government of Akhmad Kadyrov and was made a Major General of the Chechen police. When Kadyrov was assassinated on May 9, 2004, Akhnanov became the favoured candidate of the Russian government.

On June 1, 2006, Alkhanov said he would prefer his republic be governed by Sharia law and suggested adapting the Islamic code. ''"If Chechnya were run by Sharia law, it would not look as it does today. If you look at what Sharia means for women's rights, for example, you'd be surprised,"'' he said in Paris after inconclusive talks with the Council of Europe.

He is widely seen to be conflicted with Ramzan Kadyrov, a former rebel fighter and Chechen Republic's Prime Minister with presidential ambitions. Kadyrov eventually replaced Alkhanov as President in February 2007, following by placing his own people in all the leading positions.

Alu Alkhanov is married, with three children.

== Election controversy ==

Alu Alkhanov's election in August 2004 was controversial from the outset. The election of his predecessor had been marred by allegations of ballot stuffing, voter intimidation by Russian soldiers and the exclusion of possible separatist candidates. As a career bureaucrat, Alkhanov had no obvious popular base and was seen by many observers as the placeman of the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Critics of Russian policy in Chechnya claimed that the government would not permit Alkhanov to be defeated, and that the outcome of the vote had been predetermined well in advance. 

Alkhanov faced seven challengers. The most serious of these, Malik Saidullayev, a Moscow-based Chechen businessman, was barred from standing on the technicality of failing to fill his application correctly. The other six challengers had little recognition within Chechnya and several had ties with the government.<!--which one? Chechen or Russian?--> They were:
