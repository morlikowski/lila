'''William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton''' (born '''William Jefferson Blythe III''' on third-youngest president, older only than Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Clinton was described as a New Democrat and was largely known for the Third Way philosophy of governance that came to epitomize his two terms as president.<ref>Joe Klein, 'The Natural': The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton, 2003, ISBN 0-7679-1412-0</ref>  His policies, on issues such as the health care reform with a Democratic Congress, Republicans won control of the House of Representatives for the first time in forty years.<ref>[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=2154881707717 H-net Online Book Review:] Benjamin Ginsberg and Alan Stone, eds.

== Early life ==

William Jefferson Clinton was born in Hope, Virginia Dell Cassidy (1923-1994), traveled to racially segregated, Clinton's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all racial groups.<ref>[http://immigration.about.com/library/blbillclinton.htm About.com article]</ref>   In 1950, Clinton's mother returned from nursing school and shortly thereafter married Roger Clinton, who together with his brother owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas.<ref name="My Life">My Life, Bill Clinton, Random House, 2004, ISBN 0-375-41457-6</ref>  The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.

Although he assumed use of it, it was not until Billy (as he was known then) turned fourteen that he formally adopted his stepfather's surname of Clinton. Clinton says he remembers his stepfather as a alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and, at times, his half-brother, Roger, Jr.<ref name="My Life" /><ref name="First In His Class">First In His Class : A Biography Of Bill Clinton, David Maraniss, Random House, 1996, ISBN 978-0684818900</ref>

== Education ==
In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and Hot Springs High School - where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first =

In 1963, two influential moments in Clinton's life contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit to the Martin Luther King's 1963 ''I Have a Dream'' speech (he memorized Dr. King's words).<ref></ref>
right|upright|thumb|Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at [[Georgetown University in Washington D.C., receiving a degree in 1968, during which he ran for President of the Student Council.]]

With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (B.S.F.S.) degree in 1968. He spent the summer of 1967, the summer before his senior year, working as an Senator DeMolay, but he never actually became a Freemason.<ref></ref> He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi's National Honorary Band Fraternity, Inc.

Upon graduation he won a protests, including organizing an October 1969 Moratorium event.<ref name="My Life" /> In later life he admitted to smoking cannabis at the university, but claimed that he "never inhaled".<ref name="First In His Class" />

After Oxford, Clinton attended Hillary Rodham who was a year ahead of him. They married in 1975 and their only child, Chelsea, was born in 1980.

== Early political career ==
===Leader of Texas McGovern Presidential Campaign of 1972===
During Yale, Clinton took a job with the McGovern campaign and was assigned to lead McGovern's effort in Texas.  He spent considerable time in Dallas, Texas, at the McGovern campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue where he had an office.  There, Clinton worked with Ron Kirk, who was later elected mayor of Dallas twice, future governor of Texas Ann Richards, and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) Steven Spielberg.

===Governor of Arkansas===
After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a professor at the House of Representatives in 1974. The incumbent, John Paul Hammerschmidt, defeated Clinton by a 52% to 48% margin. Without opposition in the general election, Clinton was elected Arkansas Attorney General in 1976.<ref name="First In His Class" />

thumb|left|Clinton, as the newly elected [[Governor of Arkansas meeting with President Jimmy Carter in 1978.]]

Clinton was elected Kingsland in Cleveland County, polled 31% of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat in the general election that year by Republican challenger Frank D. White. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.<ref name="First In His Class" />

Clinton joined friend's Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) were a branch of the Democratic Party that called for welfare reform and smaller government, a policy supported by both Democrats and Republicans. He served as Chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.<ref name="First In His Class" />

Clinton made economic growth, job creation and educational improvement high priorities. For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medicine and increased the home property tax exemption. Clinton was responsible for some state educational improvement programs, notably more spending for schools, rising opportunities for gifted children, an increase in vocational education, and raising of teachers' salaries.<ref name="First In His Class" /><ref name="The Natural" />

Clinton's Governorship answered conservative criticism, but personal and business transactions made by the Clintons during this period became the basis of the Whitewater investigation, which dogged his later presidential administration.<ref name="Clinton Wars">The Clinton Wars, ISBN 0-374-12502-3, 2003, ISBN ISBN 0-374-12502-3</ref> After very extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.<ref name="First In His Class" /><ref name="The Survivor">''The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House'', John F. Harris , 2005, ISBN 0-375-50847-3</ref>

===Democratic Presidential Primaries of 1988===
In 1987 there was media speculation Clinton would enter the race after then-New York Governor Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. However, he gave the opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, which was nationally-televised, but it was criticized for length.<ref></ref> Presenting himself as a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.<ref name="The Natural">Joe Klein, ''The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton'' (<!--Publisher, etc.?-->2003; ISBN 0-7679-1412-0).</ref><ref name="The Choie">Bob Woodward, ''The Choice: How Clinton Won'' (<!--Publisher, etc.?-->1996; ISBN 0-684-81308-4).</ref>

====Democratic Presidential Primaries of 1992====

Due to his youthful appearance he was often called the ''"Boy Governor."''  In the first contest, the Iowa caucus, he finished a very distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. During the campaign for the New Hampshire Primary reports of an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers surfaced. As Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls,<ref name="First In His Class" /> following the Super Bowl, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on ''60 Minutes''  to refute the charges.

===="The Comeback Kid"====
Their television appearance was a calculated risk but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. On election night, Clinton labeled himself "''The Comeback Kid''." He ended leading New Hampshire by a large percentage. However, Tsongas picked up little or no momentum from his victory.<ref name="First In His Class" />

Winning the big prizes of Southern primaries gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside of his native South.<ref name="First In His Class" /><ref name="The Choie" />

With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted the New York primary, which contained a large number of delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City and won, shedding his image as a regional candidate.<ref name="The Choie" /> Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.<ref name="First In His Class" />

===Presidential Election===
thumb|right|Bill Clinton with H. [[Ross Perot, Independent, and President Republican, in a national debate.]]

Clinton won the 1992 presidential election (43.0% of the vote) against Republican incumbent populist H. Ross Perot, who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote) on a platform focusing on domestic issues; a significant part of Clinton's success was Bush's steep decline in public approval. Because Bush's Persian Gulf conflict, he was described as "unbeatable."  However, when Bush compromised with Democrats in an attempt to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes, hurting his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.<ref name="The Choie">''The choice: how Clinton won'', Bob Woodward, 1996, ISBN 0-684-81308-4</ref> By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to slightly over 40%.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-presapp0605-31.html WSJ.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="The Choice">''The choice: how Clinton won,'' Bob Woodward,1996, ISBN 0-684-81308-4</ref> Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes 
at the Republican National Convention, with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform, many moderates were alienated.<ref></ref> Clinton then pointed to his moderate, "New Democrat" record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious.<ref></ref> Many Democrats who supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their allegiance to Clinton.<ref></ref>

His election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House, and twenty of the previous twenty four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress.<ref name="whitehouse.gov bio"/> Clinton was the first president to enjoy this windfall since Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s. 

However, during the campaign questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose.<ref></ref> Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that voters would be getting two presidents "for the price of one".<ref></ref>

===First term, 1993&ndash;1997===
Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. In his inaugural address he declared:

====Legislative agenda====
Shortly after taking office, Clinton signed the homosexual men and women to serve in the armed forces garnered criticism from the left (for being too tentative in promoting gay rights) and from the right (for being too insensitive to military life). After much debate, Congress implemented the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, stating as long as homosexuals keep their sexuality secret, they may serve in the military. Some gay rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n11_v28/ai_18855826 Stranger Among Friends. - book reviews] - John Cloud, ''Washington Monthly'', November 1996</ref><ref>[http://www.gaymilitary.ucsb.edu/PressClips/03_0110_WashingtonBladeEd.htm Washington Blade Editorial: Bush Has Mandate to Let Gays Serve] - Kevin Naff, Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military, 2003-01-10</ref> These advocates feel Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting President Harry Truman used executive order to  racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argue an executive order might have prompted the Democratic Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.<ref name="The Natural" /> Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton said he did not think any serious person could say the way the policy was being implemented was not "out of whack."<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/1999/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/11/clinton.gays.military/index.html President seeks better implementation of 'do not ask, do not tell'] - CNN, 1999-12-11 </ref> 

The Clinton administration launched the first official White House website on October 21, 1994.<ref></ref><ref></ref> It was followed by three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, "Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On 17 July 1996, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13011 - Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to fully utilize information technology to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public."<ref></ref>

Also in 1993, Clinton controversially supported ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement by the U.S. Senate. Clinton, along with most of his Democratic Leadership Committee allies, strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong intra-party disagreement. Opposition chiefly came from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor, 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the President on 1 January 1994.<ref>Livingston, C. Don, Kenneth A. Wink; "The Passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the U.S. House of Representatives: Presidential Leadership or Presidential Luck?" Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 27, 1997</ref>

Clinton signed the Brady Bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low income workers.<ref name="The Survivor" />

One of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda was the result of a taskforce headed by a health care reform plan aimed at achieving universal coverage via a national healthcare plan. Though initially well-received in political circles, it was ultimately doomed by well-organized opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, John F. Harris, a biographer of Clinton's, states the program failed because of a lack of co-ordination within the White House.<ref name="The Survivor" /> Despite his party holding a majority in Congress, the effort to create a national healthcare system ultimately died under heavy public pressure. It was the first major legislative defeat of Clinton's administration.<ref name="The Natural" /><ref name="The Survivor" />

Two months later, after two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.

Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 in August 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for fifteen million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90% of small businesses,<ref></ref> and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2% of taxpayers.<ref></ref> Additionally, through the implementation of spending restraints, it mandated the budget be balanced over a number of years.

====Travelgate controversy====

When several longtime employees of the White House Travel Office were fired, the White House travel office controversy began on May 19, 1993. A whistleblower's letter, written during the previous administration, triggered an FBI investigation, which revealed evidence of financial malfeasance. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr investigated the firings and found no evidence of wrongdoing on the Clintons' part.<ref>Howard Kurtz, The Washington Post, 1998-11-23</ref>

The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose around improper access to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations. In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity. Ray's report further stated "there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved" in seeking the files.<ref></ref>

====Death penalty====

The application of the federal death penalty was expanded to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise by Clinton’s 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, "''My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.''"<ref></ref>

While campaigning for U.S. President, then-Governor Clinton returned to Arkansas to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but didn't understand the concept of death. According to Arkansas state and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the claim of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in a New York Times article as a possible political move to counter "soft on crime" accusations.<ref></ref><ref name = "mbsrgd">George Stephanopoulos, ''All Too Human: A Political Education'', 1999</ref>

According to some sources Clinton during his earlier years was a death penalty opponent, who switched positions.<ref name = "mbsrgd"/> During Clinton's Governorship Arkansas preformed first executions since 1964 (death penalty was re-enacted on March 23, 1973<ref>[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state/ Death Penalty Information Center]</ref> Totally he oversaw four executions (one by electric chair and three by lethal injection). However, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death row inmate since the federal death penalty was reintroduced in 1988.<ref>[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=126&scid=13 Clemency<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Federal executions were resumed under his successor George W. Bush.

===Second term, 1997&ndash;2001===
thumb|250px|Clinton receiving the 2000 [[Charlemagne Prize for his work toward European integration.]]

In the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2% of the popular vote over Republican Reform candidate Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.

====Lewinsky scandal====

The media and prominent Republicans<ref></ref> raised controversy over Clinton's relationship with a 22 year old White House intern named lame duck session after the 1998 elections, for the belief Clinton lied about his relationship with Lewinsky in a sworn voted to impeach Clinton in 1998, making him the second U.S. president to be impeached after Andrew Johnson.  

=====Impeachment and trial in the Senate=====

The House held no serious impeachment hearings before the mid-term elections. Though the mid-term elections held in November 1998 were at the 6-year point in an 8-year presidency (a time in the electoral cycle where the party holding the White House usually loses Congressional seats) the Democratic Party gained several seats.<ref name="The Survivor">''The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House,'' John F. Harris , 2005, ISBN 0-375-50847-3</ref> To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame duck session in December 1998.

While the House Judiciary Committee hearings were perfunctory and ended in a straight party line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely on the basis of Republican support but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony about his relationship to Monica Lewinsky during a sexual harassment lawsuit (later dismissed, appealed and settled for $850,000)<ref></ref> brought by former Arkansas-state employee Paula Jones. The obstruction charge was based on his actions during the subsequent investigation of that testimony. The Senate later voted to acquit Clinton on both charges.<ref>"CNN-Clinton_aquiter"</ref> The Senate refused to convene to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly.

The Senate concluded a twenty-one day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote on both counts falling short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an office holder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty. Some Republicans voted not guilty for both charges. On the perjury charge, fifty five senators voted to acquit, including ten Republicans, and forty five voted to convict; on the obstruction charge the Senate voted 50-50.<ref></ref>

====Digital Millennium Copyright Act====

Clinton enacted the Copyright Act since 1976. The DMCA extended the protection of sound recording copyright owners and recording artists to seek public performance royalties under statute, which proved to be a landmark achievement for the recording industry.<ref></ref>

====Military and foreign events====
Three notable military events occurred during Clinton's second term. In Clinton's Saddam Hussein's pursuit of nuclear weapons:

</ref></blockquote>}}

To weaken Saddam Hussein's grip of power, Clinton signed H.R. 4655 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of "regime change" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not speak to the use of American military forces.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4655.ENR: Iraq Liberation Act of 1998], H.R.4655, One Hundred Fifth Congress of United States of America at Second Session; Library of Congress</ref><ref>[http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/libera.htm The Iraq Liberation Act, Statement by the President], Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release, October 31, 1998</ref> The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox, lasting from December 16 to December 19, 1998. 

The Battle of Mogadishu also occurred in tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines.  This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner.  There were many more Somali casualties.  Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets and broadcasted on television news programs.  In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with less soldiers on the ground.

After initial successes such as the negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful.<ref name="The Survivor" /> The situation broke down completely with the start of the Second Intifada.

Clinton became the first president to visit Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam War
in November 2000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1025169.stm Clinton's Vietnam Visit, BBC News 2000]</ref> Clinton remained popular with the public throughout his two terms as President, ending his presidential career with a 65% approval rating, the highest end-of-term approval rating of any President since Dwight D. Eisenhower.<ref></ref> Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.<ref></ref>

====Whitewater controversy====

=====Law license suspension=====
In a separate case, Clinton was ordered to pay $25,000 in fines to Arkansas state's bar officials and his Arkansas law license was suspended for five years. <ref></ref> The agreement came on the condition that Whitewater prosecutors would not pursue federal perjury charges against him.<ref></ref> Clinton was suspended by the Supreme Court in October 2001, and, facing disbarment from that court, Clinton resigned from the Supreme Court bar in November.<ref></ref>

====Pardons and campaign finance====

Clinton issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.<ref name="The Survivor" /><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010120/aponline135239_000.htm "Clinton Pardon's List"], ''Associated Press via The Washington Post'', 2001-01-20</ref> Most of the controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons.<ref></ref> Some of Clinton's pardons remain a point of controversy.<ref>Curl, Joseph, [http://washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070706/NATION/107060099/1001 "Clintons hit over Libby criticism"], ''Washington Post''</ref>

Les disputes entre le président et le Congrès à majorité républicaine se traduisent par des retards dans le vote du budget et le gouvernement se trouve dans l’obligation de fermer tous les ministères pendant plusieurs jours. En 1996, Clinton réussit toutefois à se faire réélire, bien que la majorité du Congrès reste républicaine. Ce dernier l’obligera à adopter un budget en équilibre pour la première fois depuis 1969, du temps du président Nixon. -->
