In the history of Christianity this condition has been characterized in many ways ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a "sin nature," to something as drastic as total depravity or  automatic guilt by all humans through collective guilt.

Western Christian tradition regards original sin as the general condition of sinfulness (lack of holiness) into which human beings are born, distinct from any actual sins that a person may or may not commit later. Different views exist as to whether a person bears real guilt or personal responsibility only for actual sins that they personally commit, while being tempted by original sin, or whether they bear actual guilt for the sins of ancestors.

Eastern Christian tradition too identifies original sin as physical and spiritual death, the spiritual death being the loss of "the grace of God, which quickened (the soul) with the higher and spiritual life"<ref>[http://www.pravoslavieto.com/docs/eng/Orthodox_Catechism_of_Philaret.htm Catechism of St. Philaret], questions 166, 167, 168</ref> Others see original sin also as the cause of Matthew 7:17, NIV), although, in this view, original and actual sin may be difficult to distinguish.<ref>Johann Gerhard, <cite>Loci theologici</cite>, 5.17, quoted by Henri Blocher, <cite>Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle</cite>, (Grand Rapids: William B.

==The Fall of Man==
300px|thumb|left|[[Michelangelo's painting of the sin of Adam and Eve (the Fall)]]
Original sin is said to result from the Fall of Man, when Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit of a particular tree in the Garden of Eden. This first sin ("''the'' original sin"), an ''action'' of the first human beings, is traditionally understood to be the cause of "original sin", the fallen ''state'' from which human beings can be saved only by God's grace.

For more on this cause of original or ancestral sin, see Fall of Man.

==History of the doctrine of original sin==

The Apostolic Fathers and the Apologists mostly dealt with topics other than original sin.<ref name ="ODCC"/> The doctrine of original sin was first developed in second-century Bishop of Lyon Irenaeus's struggle against Gnosticism.<ref name ="ODCC"/> The Greek Fathers emphasized the cosmic dimension of the Fall, namely that since Adam human beings are born into a fallen world, but held fast to belief that man, though fallen, is free.<ref name ="ODCC"/> It was in the West that precise definition of the doctrine arose.<ref name ="ODCC"/>

In the struggle against Second Council of Orange in 529.<ref name="ODCC"/> Some of the followers of Augustine identified original sin with concupiscence, but this identification was challenged by the eleventh-century Saint Anselm of Canterbury , who defined original sin as "privation of the righteousness that every man ought to possess", thus separating it from concupiscence. In the twelfth century the identification of original sin with concupiscence was supported  by Peter Lombard and others, but was rejected by the leading theologians in the next century , chief of whom was Thomas Aquinas.  He distinguished the supernatural gifts of Adam before the Fall from what was merely natural, and said that what it was the former that were lost, privileges that enabled man to keep his inferior powers in submission to reason and directed to his supernatural end. Even after the fall, man thus kept his natural abilities of reason, will and passions. Rigorous Augustine-inspired views persisted among the Franciscans, though the most prominent Franciscan theologians, such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham, eliminated the element of concupiscence.

Reformers  Martin Luther and John Calvin equated original sin with concupiscence, affirming that it persisted even after baptism and completely destroyed freedom.<ref name="ODCC"/>

The Council of Trent, while not pronouncing on points disputed among Catholic theologians, condemned the teaching that in baptism the whole of what belongs to the essence of sin is not taken away, but is only cancelled or not imputed, and declared that the concupiscence that remains after baptism not truly and properly sin in the baptized, but can only be called sin in the sense that it is of sin and inclines to sin.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/councils/trent5.htm Decree 5 concerning original sin]</ref>

In 1567, soon after the close of the Council of Trent, Pope Pius V went beyond Trent by sanctioning the Aquinas's distinction between nature and supernature in Adam's state before the Fall, condemned the identification of original sin with concupiscence, and approved the view that the unbaptized could have right use of will.<ref name ="ODCC"/>

From about the 18th century, belief about original sin has tended to become softened, but has persisted in some form as in Immanuel Kant's idea of "radical evil".<ref name ="ODCC"/>

==Original sin and the fate of unbaptized infants==
However, given Augustine's belief that the only definitive destinations of souls are heaven and hell, he concluded that unbaptized infants go to hell<ref>"''Infernum''", literally "underworld," later identified as limbo.</ref><ref>"Limbo: Past Catholic statements on the fate of unbaptized infants, etc. who have died"[http://www.religioustolerance.org/limbo2.htm]</ref> because of original sin. The Latin limbo of infants".<ref>[http://www.catholicculture.org/library/view.cfm?recnum=7529 Study by International Theological Commission, 19 January 2007], 22-25</ref> The [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm#VI ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1261] declares: "As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused him to say: 'Let the children come to me, do not hinder them,'<ref>; cf. </ref> allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism." But the theory of Limbo, while it "never entered into the dogmatic definitions of the Magisterium ... remains ... a possible theological hypothesis".<ref>[http://www.catholicculture.org/library/view.cfm?recnum=7529 Study by International Theological Commission, 19 January 2007], secondary preliminary paragraph; cf. paragraph 41.</ref> 

Augustine's formulation of original sin was popular among Protestant reformers, such as Jansenist movement, but this movement was declared heretical by the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08285a.htm  "Jansenius and Jansenism" in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'']</ref>

Like other traditional church doctrines, original sin has been denied or reinterpreted by various modern Christian denominations (such as the Matthew Fox). Under such different views, Augustine's example of newborn babies would suffer the temptation to sin from their nature, but would not bear any guilt because of not actually committing sins of their own.

==Disputes concerning original sin==
The doctrine of original sin has received considerable scrutiny and debate among Christians throughout the ages, beginning with divergent opinions about how to define it.

While perhaps, in the Protestant tradition, the dominant view of original sin  assigns actual guilt to an individual from original sin,<ref>The position of the [[Roman Catholic Church is that "original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 405])</ref>  an equally important view defines original sin as a predisposition or tendency toward sin, which does not assign actual guilt to anyone. This tendency towards sin is referred to as a "sin nature." Under this view, it would be possible, but unlikely, for a person to resist the temptation to sin and live a sinless life free from guilt.  This view claims support from the Bible's admonition in Ezekiel 18:20 that 

<blockquote>
"The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him."
</blockquote>

As a result, a significant dispute centres over the emotional argument of whether an apparently innocent baby can be deemed subject to sin and death. The dispute centres around distinctions between personal sin (i.e. freely willed, conscious and understood) and original sin (not the result of free will). The Augustinian tradition makes a clear distinction between sin which is the result of freely and consciously chosen actions, and the impersonal nature of original sin; namely the unchosen context and situations into which the child is born and which surrounds the baby, and into which the child might be educated and formed. Effectively, the Augustinian teaching says that even though the baby has not made any conscious choice, it is nevertheless personally affected by—and subject to—sin, and that God's grace is essential to give hope and salvation. The Augustinian view is seen by some scholars as a negative view of human nature, since Augustine of Hippo believed that the human race, without God's help, is depraved.

Original sin, from the Augustinian perspective, is not a free and individual choice by a baby; but rather the effect of the sum total of "world sin", taught analogously through the story of the sin of Adam and Eve. The Augustinian doctrine of original sin teaches that every individual is born into a broken world where sin is already active; that they are inevitably influenced personally by the actions of others and the consequences of choices made by others. The Augustinian effectively believes that human nature—and hence every individual person—is flawed. The Augustinian remedy for original sin is baptism; the ritual washing away of the unchosen but inevitable condition of birth sin; and a vigorous declaration by Christians that sin shall not prevail, but that God's grace can overpower it with our free cooperation.

Some individuals challenge the entire doctrine of original sin as unbiblical, understanding  that the children should not be punished for the sins of the fathers. Ezekiel 18:20, as mentioned above, states that children are not to be punished for their parents' sins. On the other hand, Exodus 20:5 says, "I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me."

Those who understand original sin as personal guilt and sin, rather than as sin in an analogous sense, are confronted with a yet graver difficulty, particularly if they conceive of sin as a matter of a person's soul as such, rather than of the ensouled body, or enfleshed soul, that is the person. Sin, they say, is an issue of the soul, but, if we inherit our bodies from our parents and our souls from God, then original sin, which is inherited with human nature from our parents, must be a matter of the body; or, if it is a matter of the soul, original sin must come from God.

Judaism rejects the concept of the original sin altogether and stresses free will and men's responsibility of their actions rather than religious obedience or faith. Why, they ask, would God, who is, by dogma, universal unconditional Love, create sentient and sapient beings, then intentionally let them become corrupt—and then punish them from generation to generation with eternal torture for simply just being born in the world and for nothing else—and judge people not on their actions but by their faith or its lack—and then by whim save the beings from nothing else but from his very own wrath. 

Christian churches that deny original sin have differing explanations for the ancient Christian practice of conferring on infants what the Nicene Creed calls the "one baptism for the forgiveness of sins". Several denominations (following anabaptist traditions) reject infant baptism and insist that only persons who have reached the "age of accountability" should be baptized.

==Original sin (Christian doctrine)==

There are wide-ranging disagreements among Christian groups as to the exact understanding of the doctrine about a state of sinfulness or absence of holiness affecting all human beings, even children, with some Christian groups denying it altogether.

===Original sin in the New Testament===
The scriptural basis for the doctrine is found in two New Testament books by Paul the Apostle, Romans 5:12-21 and 1 Corinthians 15:22, in which he identifies Adam as the one man through whom death came into the world.<ref name="ODCC"/>
<ref>''Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned''—for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come. —Romans 5:12-14, ESV "Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. For ''as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous''. Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." —Rom. 5:18-21, ESV</ref>

===Original sin in Roman Catholicism===
The ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' says:

<blockquote>
By his sin Adam, as the first man, lost the original holiness and justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all human beings.

Adam and Eve transmitted to their descendants human nature wounded by their own first sin and hence deprived of original holiness and justice; this deprivation is called "original sin".

As a result of original sin, human nature is weakened in its powers, subject to ignorance, suffering and the domination of death, and inclined to sin (this inclination is called "concupiscence").

[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p7.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 416-418]
</blockquote>

''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' explains that in "yielding to the tempter, Adam and Eve committed a ''personal sin'', but this sin affected ''the human nature'' that they would then transmit in a ''fallen state'' … original sin is called "sin" only in an analogical sense: it is a sin "contracted" and not "committed"—a state and not an act" (404). This "state of deprivation of the original holiness and justice … transmitted to the descendants of Adam along with human nature" (''Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 76) involves no personal responsibility or personal guilt on their part (cf. ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 405).  Personal responsibility and guilt were Adam's, who because of his sin, was unable to pass on to his descendants a human nature with the holiness with which it would otherwise have been endowed, in this way implicating them in his sin.

thumb|400px|De Erfzonde
De '''erfzonde''' is een christelijk dogma dat inhoudt dat eenieder zondig geboren zou worden. Men zou die zondige natuur van de ouders 'erven'. Het is volgens de christelijke leer de toestand waarin de gehele mensheid zou verkeren. Deze situatie zou zijn ontstaan door de Augustinus.

Om voor de christenen te kunnen begrijpen waarom de kruisiging van Jezus Christus binnen het christendom noodzakelijk is, is het concept van de erfzonde essentieel. Het offer van Jezus Christus, die zich liet kruisigen zou de basis zijn voor de bevrijding van zowel de erfzonde als van de zelf begane zonden. Volgens deze christelijke verzoeningsleer moet men zich dan wel bekeren tot gehoorzaamheid aan God (volgens de christelijke interpretatie) en dit offer persoonlijk aanvaarden.

De erfzonde zou vanaf het begin der mensheid door ieder mens overgeërfd worden. Volgens de Maria, de moeder van Jezus (leer van de onbevlekte ontvangenis). Eveneens wordt volgens de Rooms-katholieke Kerk de erfzonde door het doopsel weggewassen. Protestantse christenen erkennen de leer van de onbevlekte ontvangenis niet en ook niet de opvatting dat de erfzonde automatisch door het doopsel wordt weggewassen.

In de loop der tijd zijn er meerdere discussies geweest over het concept van de erfzonde. Grote verdediger ervan was Augustinus uit Pelagius de erfzonde juist geheel ontkende. Er wordt wel beweerd door tegenstanders van het concept van de erfzonde dat het berust op een specifieke interpretatie van de Bijbel, in combinatie met inzichten uit de Plato en zijn opvolgers. Een twintigste-eeuwse aanhanger van het concept "erfzonde", die zich aan de hand van het Bijbelboek "Romeinen" vooral richtte op het verlost worden van deze erfzonde, was de Chinees Watchman Nee. 

Als gevolg van de erfzonde-doctrine werden tot de Tweede Wereldoorlog doodgeboren en dus ongedoopte kinderen begraven op ongewijde aarde. Begin 21e eeuw werden op sommige kerkhoven deze graven alsnog gewijd. Ook was er sprake van "nooddopingen" bij baby's die dreigden te sterven.
