'''カール・ヤストレムスキー'''（'''Carl Michael Yastrzemski''', メジャーリーグの三冠王として知られる。　

サウザンプトンにてポーランド系の家庭に生まれる。愛称「Yaz」の名で親しまれた。1961年にメジャーリーグデビューを果たし、1963年に打率.321で初の首位打者に輝く。1967年に打率.326、44本塁打、126打点で三冠王を獲得。それ以来2007年まで40年に渡り、メジャーリーグにおいて打撃三冠王はいまだに登場していない。

1967年のレッドソックスは前年のアメリカンリーグ9位から一気に一位に躍り出ることに成功し、「インポッシブル・ドリーム」と称された。しかしワールドシリーズにおいてセントルイス・カージナルスに3勝4敗で敗れ、1918年以来のシリーズ制覇はならなかった。　　

1968年に打率.301で、メジャーリーグ史上最も低い打率での首位打者となる。タイトルを獲得できなかったシーズンでも、多くの部門で常にトップ10につける確実な活躍を見せつづけた。

1975年に再びワールドシリーズに駒を進めるが、シンシナティ・レッズに再び3勝4敗で敗れる。

40歳を越えても、懸命なトレーニングを行うなどして、現役生活は1983年まで続いた。1チームに23年所属した選手は他に例を見ない。通算成績は3308試合出場（史上2位、1位はピート・ローズ）、452本塁打、1844打点、打率.285、1845四球（史上6位）。引退した1983年当時ではアメリカンリーグでの在籍のみで3000本安打と400本塁打を記録した唯一の選手となる（2006年現在ではカル・リプケンもこの記録を達成している）。

オールスター出場18回を記録し、ゴールドグラブ賞（左翼手）を7回受賞する。1989年に有資格1年目でアメリカ野球殿堂入りを果たし、現役時代に変わらずつけていた背番号'''8'''はレッドソックスの永久欠番となっている。

'''Carl Michael Yastrzemski''' (, i.e. with the "z" silent), (born American first base and as a all-star, the possessor of seven Gold Gloves, a member of the pennant for the first time in over two decades, in that season being voted the American League MVP, and being the last winner of the triple crown in the major leagues. 
 
==Early life==
Yastrzemski was born in Notre Dame briefly before embarking on his baseball career, signing with the Red Sox organization, which sent him to the minor-league Raleigh Capitals in , where he led the league with a .377 batting average,<ref name=yazbio></ref> then moved him to the Minneapolis Millers for the post-season and the  season.<ref name=millers></ref> Yastrzemski, who had studied business at Notre Dame, fulfilled a promise to his parents by finishing his degree at Merrimack College in North Andover, Mass., in 1966.<ref></ref>

==Major League career==
===Early career===
Yastrzemski began his major-league career in . From the beginning, there was tremendous pressure on him to perform, as he succeeded to the position of Sox legend Ted Williams. He would prove to be a worthy successor at the plate, and a far superior defensive player with a strong arm, expert in playing off the 'Green Monster', Fenway Park's left field wall. In 12 years as a left fielder, Yastrzemski won seven Gold Gloves and led in assists seven times. <ref></ref>

While his first two years were viewed as solid but unspectacular, he emerged as a rising star in , winning the Most Valuable Player voting.

===1967===
Yastrzemski enjoyed his best season in , when he won the Triple Crown with a .326 RBIs. He is the last hitter to have won the Triple Crown as of the  season (six different pitchers have since won the pitchers' version). He was voted Most Valuable Player almost unanimously (one voter chose Twins).

 was the season of the "Impossible Dream" for the Red Sox (referring to the hit song from the musical play ''World Series four games to three to the St. Louis Cardinals, losing three times to Bob Gibson. In that season, Yastrzemski also won the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year and ''Sports Illustrated'' magazine's "Sportsman of the Year" Award.

In an article he co-wrote for the November 1967 issue of SPORT Magazine, Yastrzemski credited Boston's remarkable season to manager Dick Williams and an infusion of youth, including Rico Petrocelli and Tony Conigliaro. Referring to Williams, Yastrzemski wrote: "He got rid of all the individuality, made us into a team, gave us an incentive, and made us want to win."<ref></ref>

===Later career===
In  Yastrzemski again won the batting championship. Because of the competitive advantages pitchers enjoyed between 1963 and 1968 (prior to the lowering of the pitcher's mound), Yastrzemski's .301 mark in "The Year of the Pitcher" is the lowest average of any batting champion in major league history; however, he was the '''only''' hitter in the American League to hit .300 for that season against such formidable pitching, as well as leading the league in on-base percentage and walks. He had many more strong seasons, consistently finishing in the top ten in the league in many statistical categories.

In , he hit the first of two straight 40 home run seasons as he led the Red Sox to third-place finishes that year and the next. Yaz got four hits and won the All-Star Game MVP in , although the American League lost. His .329 batting average that season was his career high, but finished behind Alex Johnson for the 1970 AL batting championship by less than .001. In 1970 he led the league in slugging and on-base percentage, finishing third in home runs.  

Although he hit but 61 homers over the next four years (1971 through 1974) as the Red Sox finished second twice and third twice, he finished in the top 10 in batting, and top three in on base percentage and walks in 1973 and 1974, and led the league in runs scored in 1974. 

In the 1975 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Yastrzemski was called to pinch-hit in the sixth inning, with two men on base and the American League down 3-0. Without wearing a batting helmet, Yastrzemski hit Tom Seaver's first pitch for a home run to tie the score. The 3-run homer was the only scoring the American League did that night as they lost 6-3.

Yastrzemski and the Red Sox would suffer another World Series loss in , losing four games to three to the Cincinnati Reds. Yaz made the final out in Game 7 on a fly out to center, trailing by one run. Coincidentally, he also made the final out of the  American League East division one-game playoff with a foul pop to third base. This game featured Bucky Dent's famous homer (although Reggie Jackson's home run was the eventual winning run). Earlier in the game, however, Yastrzemski began the scoring with a home run off left-handed pitcher Ron Guidry, who was having a career year (25 wins, 3 loses and a 1.74 ERA). It was the only homer the Cy Young Award winner allowed to a left-hander all season. 

In 1978 Yastrzemski, then 39, was one of the five oldest players in the league.  In 1982, playing primarily as a designated hitter, an early season hitting streak placed him among the league's leading hitters and saw him featured on the cover of the Sporting News and played in that year's All-Star game.

Yastrzemski retired in  at the age of 44. No player has had a longer career with only one team, 23 seasons, a record which he shares with walks in his career, (sixth all-time), and 1,157 extra base hits (ninth all-time). Yaz was the first player to ever collect over 3,000 hits and 400 home runs solely in the American League; the feat has since been accomplished by All-Star, 18 times.

Yaz was well-known for his batting stance, holding his bat exceptionally high, giving his swing a large, dramatic arc, and more power at the plate. However, in his later years, he adjusted his stance and held the bat lower. He was also known for modifying his batting helmets by enlarging the right ear hole (for comfort) and removing part of the right ear flap (for better vision of the ball as it was being pitched).
