'''Erich Alfred "Bubi" Hartmann'''<ref>Przez przyjaciół nazywany ''Blondwłosym Rycerzem Niemiec'', a przez wrogów - ''Czarnym Diabłem''</ref> (19 kwietnia, 1922 - 20 września, 1993) - najbardziej skuteczny as myśliwski w historii lotnictwa. Zgłosił 352 zwycięstwa nad samolotami wroga (z czego 345 stanowiły maszyny radzieckie). Odbył 825 lotów bojowych dla niemieckiej Luftwaffe, rozbijając się przy tym 14 razy.

==Młodość==
Hartmann urodził się w Wirtembergii. Większość swojego dzieciństwa spędził na Dalekim Wschodzie wraz ze swoim ojcem, który jako lekarz pracował w Chinach. Do Niemiec wrócił w szybowcowych. Licencję pilota zdobył w 1939 r., w końcu 1940 r. rozpoczął edukację lotniczą w ''Luftkriegsschule II'' (Szkole Lotnictwa Wojennego).

==Służba w Luftwaffe==
thumb|280px|Messerchmitt Bf-109G - na takim myśliwcu Hartmann osiągał swoje największe sukcesy
W październiku Messerschmitt Bf-109G.

Dowódca ''III./JG 52'' major Hubertus von Bonin przydzielił Hartmanna do doświadczonego pilota ''Oberfeldwebla'' Alfreda Grislawskiego. Po kilku dniach pozorowanych starć powietrznych i lotach praktycznych Grislawski przyznał, że jego podopieczny musi się jeszcze dużo nauczyć z zakresu taktyki walki, ale jest całkiem utalentowanym pilotem.

Następnie Hartmann został przypisany do 7. Eskadry (''Staffel'') JG 52, gdzie był skrzydłowym słynnego asa Luftwaffe Waltera Krupinskiego , który został jego mentorem i przyjacielem. Pierwszy radziecki samolot zestrzelił 5 listopada 1942 r., był to Ił-2 z ''7 GShAP''. Do końca roku miał na swym koncie jeszcze jedno zestrzelenie i tak jak wielu innych czołowych asów potrzebował czasu na wdrożenie się do roli pilota myśliwskiego.

Bitwy pod Kurskiem). W sierpniu 1943 r. miał na swym koncie 50 zestrzeleń, w tym samym miesiącu zgłosił 48 dalszych maszyn wroga. Wtedy też został awansowany do stopnia kapitana (''Staffelkapitän'') i objął dwowodzenie nad jednostką '' 9./JG52'' we wrześniu 1943 r. W końcu sierpnia 1943 r. po zaliczeniu 90 zwycięstw powietrznych został strącony i wzięty do niewoli, z której udało się mu w końcu zbiec i dotrzeć do linii niemieckich. W październiku 1943 r. zgłosił kolejne 33 strącenia. Za to osiągnięcie 29 października 1943 r. przyznano mu ''Krzyż Rycerski Żelaznego Krzyża'' (''Ritterkreuz''), miał wówczas na swym koncie 148 zestrzeleń. Pod koniec tego roku osiągnął liczbę 159 maszyn wroga.

Rok 1944 był jeszcze bardziej owocny dla Hartmanna. Jego niesamowite osiągnięcia zaczęły budzić zdziwienie nawet w Najwyższym Dowództwie Luftwaffe. Jego zgłoszenia sprawdzano nawet dwukrotnie albo trzykrotnie, przydzielono mu nawet do formacji, w której latał, człowieka, którego zadaniem było tylko obserwowanie wyczynów Hartmanna. W marcu miał już 202 strącenia. W tym czasie radzieccy piloci zaznajomili się już z jego sygnałem radiowym - ''Karaja Jeden'', a sowieckie dowództwo wyznaczyło za jego głowę nagrodę. Hartmann dodał wówczas znak rozpoznawczy na swój myśliwiec, którym był Czarny Tulipan. Od tego momentu jego przeciwnicy, którzy spostrzegli ten kwiat, zniechęcali się i często oddalali bez podejmowania walki. Dlatego też samolot z tym znakiem był przydzielany nowicjuszom, którzy latali dzięki temu we względnym bezpieczeństwie.

Trzechsetną maszynę Hartmann zestrzelił Hermanna Göringa, który obawiał się negatywnego wpływu na morale Niemców w razie ewentualnego zestrzelenia ich czołowego asa. Jednak Hartmannowi udało się uzyskać zezwolenie na powrót do jednostki bojowej. Za zniszczenie 300 maszyn sowieckich Hartmann stał się jednym z 27 żołnierzy, którzy zostali odznaczeni "Diamentowym Krzyżem Rycerskim".

W ciągu 1944 r. zgłosił 172 zwycięstwa powietrzne, co było niepobitym rekordem dla jednego roku walki. W czerwcu miał okazję po raz pierwszy zmierzyć się z Amerykanami, zestrzelił wówczas cztery Mustangi P-51 nad Rumunią, ale w następnym miesiącu został zmuszony do przymusowego lądowania, gdy w czasie walki zabrakło mu paliwa.

Na początku Me-262. Hartmann jednak odmówił i został w macierzystej ''JG 52''.

'''Erich Alfred "Bubi" Hartmann''' (German fighter pilot and still is the highest scoring fighter ace in the history of aerial combat. He scored 352 aerial victories (of which 345 were won against the Soviet Air Force, and 260 of which were fighters) in 1,404 combat missions and engaging in aerial combat 825 times while serving with the ''Luftwaffe'' in World War II. During the course of his career, Hartmann was forced to crash land his damaged fighter 14 times. This was due to damage received from parts of enemy aircraft he had just shot down, or mechanical failure. Hartmann was never shot down or forced to land due to enemy fire.<ref>Toliver & Constable 1986, p. 12.</ref>

Hartmann, a pre-war Eastern front and was fortunate to be placed under the supervision of some of the Luftwaffe's most experienced fighter pilots. Under their guidance Hartmann steadily developed his tactics which would earn him the coveted  Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds on 25 August 1944 for claiming 301 aerial victories.

He scored his 352nd and last aerial victory on 8 May 1945. He and the remainder of JG 52 surrendered to United States Army forces and were turned over to the Red Army. Convicted of false "War Crimes" and sentenced to 25 years of hard labour, Hartmann would spend 10 years in various Soviet prison camps and gulags until he was released in 1955. In 1956, Hartmann joined the newly established West German Luftwaffe and became the first ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of ''Jagdgeschwader 71'' "Richthofen". Hartmann resigned early from the Bundeswehr in 1970, largely due to his opposition to the F-104 Starfighter deployment in the ''Bundesluftwaffe'' and the resulting clashes with his superiors over this issue. Erich Hartmann died in 1993.<ref name="Berger p107">Berger 1999, p. 107.</ref>

==Early life==
Erich Hartmann was born in prisoner, and spent four years in British captivity).  Most of the boys' childhood was spent in doctor who wanted to escape the economic depression which German suffered after the First World War:  with help from his cousin, German consul in Shanghai, Dr. Hartmann went to China and found work in Changsha.  Erich and his family were forced to return to Germany in 1928 because of the Chinese Civil War.<ref>Toliver and Constable 1986, pp. 15, 16.</ref>

Erich attended the Gymnasium in Gymnasium in Korntal, which he attended from April, 1937, until April, 1940, and where he his wife-to-be.  Ursula "Usch" Paetsch was only 15 years old at the time and initially her parents were unhappy about her friendship with Erich Hartmann, but they came to accept it.<ref name="personal data">Toliver and Constable 1986, p. 296.</ref>

Young Hartmann joined the Nazis came to power in 1933, gliding was encouraged by the German government.  Elisabeth Hartmann helped set up a flying school at Weil im Schönbuch in 1936, and fourteen--year-old Erich became an instructor in it.<ref>Kaplan 2007, p. 89.</ref>

==Military career==
Hartmann got his pilot's license in 1939 and started his military training on Neukuhren and from Berlin-Gatow. 
His first flight with an instructor took place on 5 March 1941, and flew as a solo pilot on 24 March. Hartmann completed his basic training in October 1941. 
His next stop on Lachen-Speyerdorf. This advanced pilot training was completed on 31 January 1942. He learned to fly the Messerschmitt Bf 109 at the ''Jagdfliegerschule 2'' in Zerbst/Anhalt, beginning on 1 March 1942 until 20 August 1942. By this time he was qualified to fly 17 different types of powered aircraft. His next posting, lasting from 21 August 1942 to 10 October 1942, was ''Jagdergänzungsgruppe Ost'' (Fighter Supply Group, East) in Gleiwitz in Upper Silesia.<ref name="personal data"/><ref>Kaplan 2007, p. 90.</ref>

Hartmann's military career may have ended before it began. On 31 March 1942, Erich was flying a Bf 109 during gunnery training. He took the opportunity to break the rules by doing Aerobatics over the Zerbst airfield. Hartmann was immediately confined to quarters and fined two-thirds of his pay, for a three month period. Hartmann recalled that the incident saved his life:

<blockquote>That week confined to my room actually saved my life. I had been scheduled to go up on a gunnery flight the afternoon that I was confined. My roommate took the flight instead of me, in an aircraft I had been scheduled to fly. Shortly after he took off, while on his way to the gunnery range, he developed engine trouble and had to crash-land near the Hindenburg-Kattowitz railroad. He was killed in the crash.<ref>Kaplan 2007, p. 90.</ref><ref>Toliver and Constable 1986, p. 31. </ref></blockquote>

Hartmann continued to practice hard. During a gunnery practice session in June 1942, Erich hit a target drogue with 24 of the alloted 50 rounds of machine gun fire.<ref>Kaplan 2007, p. 90.</ref>

===Into the Luftwaffe===
Hartmann got his "wings" in 1941 and was assigned to the fighter wing ''Eastern Front in the Messerschmitt Bf 109G. ''JG 52'' were based at Maykop, but Hartmann and several other pilots were to ferry several Junkers Ju 87 ''Stukas'' down to Mariupol, as there were not any replacement Bf 109s needed by ''JG 52''. Hartmann's first flight in the ''Stuka'' ended in a crash due to brake failure. The Junkers went straight into the controller's hut, destroying it.<ref>Toliver and Constable 1986, pp. 32-33.</ref>

The commander of ''III./JG 52'', Edmund "Paule" Roßmann, but Hartmann also flew with such experienced pilots as Alfred Grislawski,  Hans Dammers and Josef Zwernemann. After a few days of intensive mock combats and practice flights, Grislawski admitted that, although Hartmann had much to learn regarding combat tactics, he was a quite talented pilot. But it was Paule Rossmann that taught him the fundamentals of the surprise attack, a tactic, which would lead to Hartmann's "See – Decide – Attack – Reverse" style of aerial combat.<ref name="See-Decide-Attack-Reverse">Toliver and Constable 1986, pp. 46–47, 54, 61, 84.</ref>

Hartmann flew his first combat mission on Il-2 from ''7 GShAP'' (7th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Regiment). By the end of the year he had added only one more kill and, as with many top aces, took some time to establish himself as a consistently scoring fighter pilot.<ref>Deac 1998, p. 30.</ref>

Hartmann was assigned to ''7./JG 52'' to serve as wingman to the ace LaGG-5 then collided with a second Soviet fighter while climbing into position for a second attack. Hartmann regained control of his damaged aircraft without crashing.<ref>Kurowski 1996, p. 177.</ref> 

On 7 July 1943, he shot down seven enemy aircraft in a single day, during the massive dogfights that occurred during the Battle of Kursk. He had reached 50 victories by August 1943, and in that month claimed another 48 kills. He was then appointed ''Staffelkapitän'' of ''9./JG 52'' in September 1943. 

Hartmann accorded the Russian pilots a distinct lack of respect in the first year of his service. Hartmann recalled that most Soviet fighters did not have proper gunsights, and that Soviet pilots resorted to drawing hand-painted sights on the windshield.
Hartman said that while he considered the P-39 Airacobra, Curtiss P-40 and Hawker Hurricane inferior to the Fw 190 and Bf 109, they provided the Soviets with valuable gunsight technology:

<blockquote>In the early days, incredible as it may seem, there was no reason for you to feel fear if the Russian fighter was behind you. With their hand-painted "gunsights" they couldn't pull the lead properly or hit you<ref>Kaplan 2007, p. 93.</ref></blockquote>

However, Hartmann and JG 52 soon found himself learning various "techniques" from captured Soviet pilots.
The German pilots and ground crew suffered chronic problems with the Russian winter. A captured Soviet airman offered to help. Hartmann and his ground crew watched in horror as the Russian poured fuel into the aircraft's oil sump. Expecting the Bf 109 to blow up, the engine started at the first time of asking, and ran "smoothly". The Russian explained that frozen oil prevented aero engines from starting, but the fuel liquefied the oil, and then evaporated in the heat.
Another Russian pilot "proudly", showed Hartmann another way. Pouring fuel into a tray he ignited it and put it under the engine. The Germans were convinced it would ruin the electrical systems. It did not, and the engine started straight away.<ref>Kaplan 2007, p. 104.</ref>
Hartmann would find this useful. From now the fighter unit could take off in extreme temperatures during the harsh winter months.

====Behind enemy lines====
By late August of 1943, Hartmann had ninety aerial victories, but on August 19th, in combat with Il-2s, his aircraft was damaged by debris and he was forced to land behind Soviet lines. ''Stukas in a counter attack.  The situation had changed, and the flight of eight fighters engaged Russians Yaks and Laggs that were supporting Il-2 Sturmoviks on a ground-attack mission.  Hartmann shot down two enemy aircraft before his fighter was hit by debris and he was forced to make an emergency landing.  He then, in accordance with Luftwaffe regulations, attempted to recover the precision board clock.  As he was doing so, Soviet ground troops approached.  Realising that capture was unavoidable, he faked internal injuries.  Hartmann's acting so convinced the Soviets that they put him on a stretcher and placed him on a truck.<ref>Kaplan 2007, p. 102.</ref> 

Hartmann patiently waited for the right moment, then jumped the single guard just as Stukas began an attack.  He "bailed out" the back of the truck and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers; evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall.  In the dark, Hartmann followed a Russian patrol heading west to the front.  As he approached the German position, a sentry challenged him and fired a shot which passed through Hartmann's trousers. When Hartmann's Crew Chief, Heinz "Bimmel" Mertens, heard what had happened, he took a rifle and went to search for Hartmann.<ref>Toliver and Constable 1986, pp. 64–77.</ref> 

In October of 1943, Hartmann claimed another 33 kills and was awarded the ''Ritterkreuz'' on October 29, 1943, after a total of 148 kills. At the end of the year his toll stood at 159.<ref>Deac 1998, p. 34.</ref>

====The Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross====
left|thumbnail|Erich Hartmann
In January &ndash; February 1944, Hartmann claimed 50 kills in 60 days. Throughout 1944, Hartmann claimed 172 victories, a total surpassed only by his friend Luftwaffe High Command; his claims were double- and triple-checked, and his performance closely monitored by an observer flying in his formation. On 2 March, he reached 202 kills.<ref>Weal 2001, p. 73.</ref> By this time the Soviet pilots were familiar with Hartmann's radio call-sign of ''Karaya 1'' and the Soviet Command had put a price of 10,000 engine cowling near the spinner of his aircraft, so Soviet personnel consequently nicknamed him ''Cherniye Chort'' ("Black Devil"). However, Hartmann's opponents were often reluctant to stay and fight if they noticed his personal design. As a result, this aircraft was often allocated to novices, who could fly it in relative safety. On 21 March, Hartmann scored ''JG 52''s 3,500th kill of the war.<ref>Weal 2003a, p.74.</ref> Adversely, the reluctance of the Soviet airmen to fight, caused Hartmann's kill rate to drop. Hartmann then had the tulip design removed, and his aircraft painted just like the rest of his unit. In the following two months, Hartmann amassed over 50 kills.<ref>Kaplan 2007, pp. 104-105.</ref> 

In March 1944, Erich Hartmann, Berghof in Berchtesgaden. Barkhorn was to be honoured with the Swords while Hartmann, Krupinski and Wiese were to receive the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross. On the train all four of them got drunk on cognac and champagne. Supporting each other and unable to stand they arrived at Berchtesgarden. Major  Nicolaus von Below, Hitler's Luftwaffe adjutant, was shocked. After some time of sobering out, Hartmann was still intoxicated from the alcohol. Hartmann took a German officer hat from a stand and put it on, but it was too large. Von Below became upset and told Hartmann it was Hitler’s and ordered him to put it back.<ref>Toliver and Constable 1986, pp. 9–11.</ref>

====Defense of the Reich: Fighting the United States Army Air Forces====
On 21 May 1944, Hartmann engaged United States Army Air Force aircraft for the first time. While flying "top cover" for another ''Schwarm'', Hartmann bounced a flight of four P-51 Mustangs over Bucharest, Romania, downing two  while the other two P-51s fell victim to his fellow pilots.<ref name="Kaplan p115">Kaplan 2007, p. 115.</ref> On June 1, 1944 Hartmann shot down four Mustangs in a single mission over the Ploieşti oil fields.<ref>Toliver and Constable 1985, pp. 177–182, 339 </ref> Later that month, during his fifth combat with American pilots he shot down two more Mustangs before being forced to bail out, when eight other Mustangs ran his Messerschmitt out of fuel. During the intense manoeuvring, Hartmann managed to line-up one of the Mustangs at close range, but heard only a "clank" when he fired, as he had run out of ammunition.<ref name="Kaplan p115"/><ref>Toliver and Constable 1986, pp. 165–169.</ref> Whilst hanging in his parachute, the Mustangs circled above him, and Erich wondered if they would take this opportunity to kill him. One of the Mustangs broke away and headed straight for him, only to bank away from him at the last moment, waving at Erich as he went by.<ref>Kaplan 2007, p. 116.</ref>

On 17 August 1944, Hartmann became the top scoring fighter ace, surpassing fellow ''JG 52'' pilot Gerhard Barkhorn, with his 274th kill.

====The Diamonds to the Knight's Cross====
On Knight's Cross.<ref>Weal 2003a, p. 71.</ref>

Hartmann was summoned to the ''Führerhauptquartier Wolfsschanze'', Rastenburg'', to receive the coveted award from Hitler personally. On arrival he was asked to surrender his assassination attempt on 20 July 1944. Hartmann refused and threatened to decline the Diamonds if he were not trusted to carry his pistol. After consulting Oberst Nicolaus von Below, Hitler's Luftwaffe adjutant, Hartmann was allowed to keep his side arm and accepted the Diamonds.<ref>Toliver and Constable 1986, pp. 142–143.</ref>

During Hartmann's meeting with Hitler, Hartmann discussed at length the shortcommings of fighter pilot training. Hitler revealed to Hartmann that he believed that, "militarily, the war is lost", and that he wished the ''Luftwaffe'' had "more like him and Rudel".<ref>Weal 2001, p. 79.</ref>

The Diamonds to the Knight's Cross also earned him a ten day leave. On his way to his vacation, Hartmann was ordered by ''Berlin-Gatow. Galland wanted to transfer Hartmann to the Messerschmitt Me 262 test program. Hartmann requested that the transfer be cancelled on the grounds of his deep attachment to JG 52. Galland, valuing comradeship and seeing the merit in Hartmann's request, cancelled the transfer to the jet squadron and rescinded the order that had taken him off combat operations. Galland then ordered Hartmann to the ''Jagdfliegerheim'' (vacation resort for fighter pilots) in Bad Wiessee.<ref>Toliver and Constable 1985, p. 148.</ref> It is here that on 10 September 1944, Hartmann married his long-time teenage love, Ursula "Usch" Paetsch. Witnesses to the wedding included his friends Barkhorn and Batz.<ref>Hartman and Jäger 1992, pp. 139–145.</ref>

====Fighting technique====
thumb|250px|Hartmann flew a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 Fighter]]
Unlike Hans-Joachim Marseille who was a marksman and expert in the art of deflection shooting, Hartmann was a master of stalk-and-ambush tactics. By his own account he was convinced that 80% of the pilots he downed did not even realize what hit them. He relied on the powerful engine of his Messerschmitt Bf-109 for high-power sweeps and quick approaches, occasionally diving through entire enemy formations to take advantage of the confusion that followed in order to disengage. His favourite method of attack was to hold fire until extremely close (60ft/20m or less), then unleash a short burst at point-blank range – a technique he learned while flying as wingman of his former commander, Walter Krupinski, who favoured this approach. This technique, as opposed to long-range shooting, allowed him to:<ref>Spick 1996, p. 201.</ref><ref name="See-Decide-Attack-Reverse"/>

* reveal his position only at the last possible moment
* compensate for the low muzzle velocity of the slower firing 30 mm MK 108 cannon equipping some of the later Bf 109 models, (though most of his victories were claimed with Messerschmitts equipped with the high velocity MG 151 cannon) 
* place his shots accurately with minimum waste of ammunition
* prevent the adversary from taking evasive actions

However, firing at close range ran the risk of having to fly through the debris of a damaged or exploding aircraft, thereby damaging his own fighter in the process (much of the damage Hartmann sustained in combat was caused by collision with flying debris). If it was dangerous to dog-fight further he would break off and content himself with one victory. His careful approach was described by himself by the line "See &ndash; Decide &ndash; Attack &ndash; Break": observe the enemy, decide how to proceed with the attack, make the attack, and then disengage to re-evaluate the situation.<ref name="See-Decide-Attack-Reverse"/>

Hartmann once famously described dog-fighting as "a waste of time".

====Surrender====
From February 1st to February 14, 1945, Hartmann briefly led I./JG 53 as acting ''Gruppenkommandeur'' until he was replaced by Helmut Lipfert.  In March of 1945, Hartmann, his score now standing at 336 aerial victories, was asked a second time by General Adolf Galland to join the Me-262 units forming to fly the new jet fighter.  Hartmann attended the jet conversion program led by Heinrich Bär.  Galland also intended Hartmann to fly with JV 44.  Hartmann declined the offer, preferring to remain with ''JG 52''. Some sources report that Hartmann's decision to stay with his unit was due to a request via telegram made by ''Oberstleutnant'' Hermann Graf.<ref>Weal 2003a, p.82.</ref> Now ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of ''I./JG 52'', Erich Hartmann claimed his 350th aerial victory on April 17, 1945, in the vicinity of Chrudim.  The last wartime photograph of Hartmann known was taken in connection with this victory.<ref>Weal 2004, p. 119.</ref>
