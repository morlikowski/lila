320px|thumb|right|Leaving some small change on a restaurant table is a common way of giving a tip to the serving staff.

A tip (also called a '''gratuity''') is a payment made to certain custom.
Tipping varies among cultures and by service industry. Though by definition a tip is never legally required, and its amount is at the discretion of the person being served, in some circumstances failing to give an adequate tip when one is expected would be considered very miserly, a violation of etiquette, or unethical. In some other cultures or situations, giving a tip is not expected and offering one would be considered condescending or demeaning. In some circumstances (such as tipping government workers), tipping is illegal. 

==Etymology==
The word originates from the 16th century verb ''tip'', which meant "to give unexpectedly", and was derived from the German word ''tippen'', meaning "to tap." The modern German version would instead be ''Trinkgeld'', literally meaning "Drink Gold", or "Money to Drink"<ref name="autogenerated1">http://www.michigan.gov/cis/0,1607,7-154-10555_12902_13118-34612--,00.html</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=tip&searchmode=none] See "Tip (version 2)" and "Tip (version 3)"</ref> 

The notion of a ''stock tip'' is from the same slang, and the expression ''hot tip'', as in a sure winner in a horse race, also comes from the act of tapping. In the old days, during card games, gamblers would have an accomplice in the room. This accomplice would signal the player regarding the contents of an opponent's hand by "tipping the wink" - that is, by "tapping" out a code with his eyelid.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The Oxford English Dictionary states that ''tip'' is derived from the English thieves (which may be taken to mean "gambler") slang word ''tip'', meaning "to pass from one to another" (cf. "to give unexpectedly.")

The word "tip" is often inaccurately claimed to be an acronym for terms such as "to insure prompt service", "to insure proper service", "to improve performance", and "to insure promptness". However, this etymology contradicts the Oxford English Dictionary<ref>''The Compact Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993. ISBN 0-19-861258-3.</ref> and is probably an example of a backronym.  Moreover, all of these backronyms incorrectly require the word "insure" instead of the correct "ensure".

Some claim the origin for this term is a concept from Judaism, in that it was a ''chiyuv'' (obligation) for a seller to "tip the scales" in favor of the customer. The Torah says, "''Nosen lo girumov'' (Give to him a tip)." For example, if your customer has asked for three pounds of onions, you should measure out the three pounds plus one extra onion, tipping the scale in his favor.<ref>"[http://www.torah.org/learning/honesty/question85.html Question 85: Extra Food in a Restaurant]." ''Honesty'', ''torah.org''.</ref>

==Circumstances of tipping==
In countries where tipping is the rule (for example United States), complicated social rules and etiquette have developed over the exact percentage to tip, and what should and should not be included in this calculation. In other cultures where tipping exists it is more flexible and no specific assumptions of the tip amount exist.
 
Some establishments pool tips and divide them to include employees who lack customer contact.
At some restaurants, agreements among the staff require the servers to '''tip out''' members of the support staff (kitchen, bartender, and busser) at the end of their shift;<ref>Internal Revenue Service. "[http://www.irs.gov/faqs/faq4-12.html 4.12: Tips]". ''Frequently Asked Questions''.</ref>; this means that servers pay a certain fixed percentage of their sales (most often a portion less than 15 percent of total sales) to the other staff. Thus when a patron leaves a small tip, it results in the server having to receive less from the tipping pool than other staff. <ref>"[http://tip20.com/div/con/index.html Tipping Standards (United States)]", ''Tip20! Service Industry Resource''.</ref>

Tipping is not expected when a fee is explicitly charged for the service. For example, a corruption are sometimes disguised as tipping. In some places, police officers and other civil servants openly solicit tips, gifts and dubious fees using a variety of local euphemisms. For example, a traffic policeman in Mexico might ask a commuter to buy him a "refresco" (soft drink), while a Nigerian officer might expect "a little something for the weekend."<ref></ref>

===Tax and labor-law treatment===
In some jurisdictions, tipped workers qualify for a lower statutory minimum wage from the employer, and therefore may supplement deficient pay with tips. For example, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires restaurant employers to ensure that the total tip income reported to them during any pay period is at least eight percent of their total receipts for that period. If the reported total is below eight percent, employers must allocate as income the difference between the actual tip income reported and eight percent of gross receipts.<ref>Internal Revenue Service. "[http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/industries/article/0,,id=98401,00.html Reporting Tip Income]." ''Restaurant Tax Tips''.</ref> Therefore the IRS is implicitly assuming the average tip to be eight percent.

Legally, tips should be reported as income for tax purposes by the recipient,<ref>Internal Revenue Service. Publication 1872. "[http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1872.pdf Tips on Tips: A Guide to Tip Income Reporting for Employees in the Food and Beverage Industry]."</ref> 

A '''tronc''' is an arrangement for the pooling and distribution to employees of tips, gratuities and/or service charges in the hotel and catering trade. The person who distributes monies from the tronc is known as the troncmaster. When a tronc exists in the UK, responsibility for operating PAYE on the distribution may lie with the troncmaster rather than the employer.<ref>http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/echmanual/ech13010.htm Tronc Schemes</ref> (The word 'tronc' has its origins in the French for collecting box.)

==Tipping by Continent==
===Africa===
====Egypt====
Tipping in Egypt can be tricky. Most public bathrooms are staffed, and visitors are expected to tip the attendant. Some restroom attendants, especially at tourist sites, will dole out toilet paper based on the tip they receive. Some locals have been known to attempt to demand baksheesh for minor services, such as assisting people out of their cars or helping people up if they trip in the street. Foreigners may be especially susceptible to this, and although some locals ask or demand tips, they are often not warranted. There is no rule for what is considered tip-worthy, so one must be ready to hand out an Egyptian pound or two just in case to use the bathroom or to get into some buildings. For services such as tour guides or translators, a tip of 20% or more is generally accepted. Taxis don't run on meters, just on agreed upon prices, so there is no additional tip to give, although some drivers may ask for extra. Tips are expected at restaurants, and can range from a few pounds to 15%.

====South Africa====
In petrol station attendants for additional services, such as cleaning one's windscreen. Toilet cleaners at service stations along major road routes are sometimes tipped when they provide good service and keep the facilities clean. "Car guards", who claim to "look after" one's parked car are often given a small tip if they are in uniform and authorized; however those without uniforms are usually regarded as a nuisance, and tipping them is not compulsory, despite the fact that they often harass motorists looking for payment.

====Ethiopia====
In Ethiopia tipping is common in hotels, restaurants and bars. One is also expected to tip parking lot attendants whether officially hired by institutions or self assigned. In some restaurants it is customary to tip any dancers, and this is usually done by sticking the paper money bill on the forehead of the dancer.

===Asia===

Tipping is frowned upon in Asia and shows anger at the low prices, although there are regional variations.

====China====
In Mandarin, the term used is 小費 (''xiǎo fèi'', lit. "small change") or 打賞 (''Da shang'', lit. "give awards"). In Cantonese, the term used is ''tip''屎 (''tip si''), transliterated from the word 'tips'.

=====Hong Kong=====
Tipping in Hong Kong is customary in some situations, but it can create legal issues due to some Hong Kong specific ordinances prohibiting tipping for certain services such as public utilities. Waiters, who have already receive a compulsory 10% service charge, may occasionally be given an additional gratuity. 

* Restaurants: 10% is usually included in the bill presented to the customer. 
* Bars: tipping is not a normal occurrence, though some may round the bill.
* Hotels: service charge is always included, but bell-boys may expect a small gratuity.
* Taxis: the driver customarily rounds the bill. No matter how long the trip is, extra tipping is not expected.

====India====
In India there has traditionally been little or no tipping. Tips in India are never a percentage of the total value and many traditional restaurants in India do not expect a tip. However, this attitude has begun to change. While some people many leave as little as 5% or less of the total bill, people in major cities such as Bombay usually leave an amount that is about 10% of the value of the bill. Some restaurants have also have started placing jars at the cashier for people to drop in some change if they feel so, but this is a rather rare phenomenon. Most clubs in India have a complete ban on its members from tipping.  Usually no service industry except the food services industry expects a tip. In India, it is illegal for taxi or rickshaw drivers to charge anything above the meter.

====Japan====
Tipping is not the common custom in Japan and it is almost never done at casual restaurants, as it is considered rude, implying that servers must be paid extra to ensure they do their job. When tipping occurs, the term used is チップ (''chippu'', from English "tip"), or 心付け (''kokorozuke'', lit. "pay from the heart").

====Malaysia====
Tipping is not customarily done in Malaysia. Service charge of 10% is included in total bill in most air conditioned restaurants.

====Singapore====
Tipping is not required in Singapore; however it is common for restaurants to levy a 10% service charge before GST.

====South Korea====
Tipping is not the custom in South Korea and it is almost never expected. Many hotels and a few tourist restaurants add 10% service charge on their checks. However, it is deemed customary (although not mandatory) to tip porters and maids in international hotels, and it is always considered a generous gesture to ask taxi drivers to keep the change.

====Taiwan====
In Taiwan tipping is rare except when a customer uses a porter at an airport, which is usually 50 new Taiwan dollars per luggage, or wants to show appreciation for exceptional service. Many restaurants and hotels already add 10% service charges.<ref>Taiwan Government Information Office."[http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/20Tourism.htm Chapter 20: Tourism]". ''Taiwan Yearbook 2006''.</ref> Taxi drivers may not wilfully refuse to make change or ask for tips.

=== Oceania ===
====Australia====
In garbage dump, rather than having anything to do with gratuities.  

When paying for a transaction with cash, it is acceptable to offer to a seller “keep the loose change” and avoid a pocket filled with coins. More common is the gesture to drop these coins into a charity tin kept near the cash register to raise money for the service club or charity. A tip is not expected when using a credit card as the total would include a service charge. 

The tipping practice of American tourists is increasingly common at some hospitality establishments in larger cities for exceptional service. In recent decades, tip jars have been sighted in some urban areas although it is still regarded by locals as a personal and optional choice.

Casinos in Australia generally prohibit tipping of gaming staff, as it is considered bribery. (For example, in the state of Tasmania, the Gaming Control Act 1993 states in section 56 (4): "it is a condition of every special employee's licence that the special employee must not solicit or accept any gratuity, consideration or other benefit from a patron in a gaming area." <ref>[http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;doc_id=94%2B%2B1993%2BAT%40EN%2B20070406010000 Tasmanian Gaming Control Act 1993]</ref>)

====New Zealand====
Tipping is not part of New Zealand culture and is often treated with suspicion or actively frowned upon, as many people view it as a largely American custom that over-compensates certain workers while others are left out; additionally there is a feeling that tipping is paying twice for one service. Despite this, some forms of tipping are common, such as rounding up a taxi fare. It is almost as likely, however, that the taxi driver will round the fare down to the nearest dollar. Some cafés keep a jar on the counter marked "tips for staff" in which customers can leave small change. Occasionally tips are given in a restaurant for exceptional service; particularly in the larger cities like Wellington or Auckland. Others may feel that the people who do this are being ostentatious and showing off their wealth. New Zealanders traveling overseas often find the custom difficult and confusing.

However, many New Zealanders travel and live in other countries, often returning to New Zealand; bringing the tipping habit back with them.

In general, people who perform a service in New Zealand, such as waiters and hairdressers, are tipped with a smile and a thank you. This is considered reasonable because their average wage is substantially larger than their American counterparts.

===Europe===
In general, in the European Union and other parts of Europe, tipping is uncommon, although there are regional variations.

==== Austria ====
In Austria, tipping is common and, although legally not mandatory, often considered as socially obligatory. Giving 5% to 10% of the total amount is common; more signals exceptionally good service. Paying a multiple of a Euro is usual, for low sums the amount paid is often a multiple of 50 cents (i.e. a bill of 7.80 can be paid as 8 or 8.50).

Tipping is not practised when the goods are exchanged over the counter (i.e. in fast-food restaurants or at street stalls). Traditionally, the owner of a restaurant (known as "Wirt" in German) does not receive a tip. A tip is known in the German language as ''Trinkgeld'', which literally translates as 'money for drink'. In similar fashion, the French expression is ''pourboire''. It is also common practice to tip other service employees, like taxi drivers or hair dressers.

==== Bulgaria ====

Tipping, called бакшиш (''bakshish'') in Bulgarian, is not the custom in Bulgaria, although one can leave a tip as a sign of appreciation.

==== Croatia ====
Tipping is not particularly common, although it may occur in restaurants and bars. Prices are usually already adjusted upwards, and labour laws ensure a minimum wage for all workers, therefore tipping is usually not expected.

A unique practice of tipping exists among the pensioners who receive their pension via mail in rural settlements. They may leave any coinage to the postman who delivers it as a sign of appreciation.

====Czech Republic====
Although it is customary to tip in the Czech Republic, it has very little to do with the size of the bill, and more to do with a sign of appreciation.

====Denmark, Sweden and Norway====
The service charge is not separated from the bill, but adjusted for in the  salary of the person.  Traditionally, the tip has not been common, but is being introduced by outside influence. Tipping should only be given as a token of real appreciation for the service.  Be aware that the tips will most often be split between the waiters and the kitchen. If you want to thank a specific person, make sure to tell them it is a personal gift Taxi drivers do not expect tips, any extra service (such as carrying bags) will be listed on the receipt according to rate. In this region, tipping is sometimes referred to as ''driks'' (Norwegian) but usually just ''tips'', ''drikkepenge'' (Danish) or ''dricks'' (Swedish), meaning ''for drinks''. 

====Finland====
In Finland tipping, known as ''tippi'' ("tips") or ''juomaraha'' (literally "drink money") is entirely optional. Coat checkers generally have a compulsory service fee. Tips are preferred in cash instead of credit cards, because of avoiding sharing with the employer and with the tax office. For clerks, police, etc. tipping is not allowed, and could lead to legal problems.

====France====
In France, service charge is always included, and so tipping, or ''le pourboire'' (lit. "for a drink"), is not expected. It is however not at all uncommon to leave some small change on the table.

====Germany====
In Germany, tips (''das Trinkgeld'', lit. "drink money") are expected in many situations. In bars, restaurants (except fast food places without table service), guided tours, taxicabs and sometimes barber shops, tips are expected to be about 5 - 10% of the total amount if the guest was satisfied with the service. The owner of the business was usually not tipped even if he served his customers personally, but this is changing. When the bill is presented, pay any multiple of 0.50 Euro, because very poor tips are considered rude. If the customer does not want to give an appropriate amount, he should rather give no tip at all. However, it is acceptable to leave cents in change money behind adding ''"Stimmt so!"'' (pronounced: ''shtimt zo''; meaning: ''I'm OK with this'').

Public toilet ("WC" in German) attendants are often tipped €0.30 to €0.50, usually by leaving the money on a plate by the door.

It is customary to give a relatively large tip around Christmas time to such people as house cleaners, postmen, garbage collectors, and the newspaper delivery men.

====Greece====

In Greece tip is known as ''filodorima'' (meaning ''gift for a friend''). Tipping traditionally is not based on a predetermined percentage. Customers usually leave a tip to the 'maitre',waiters,valets and bell boys, varying from few coins to large amounts of money, according to how satisfied they are by the service. In some cases, waiters gain more money from tips than their wage. Tipping to taxi drivers is uncommon.

====Hungary====

Tips are given in Hungary for some services: in restaurants, in bars, to cab drivers, to hairdressers, and often to people that fix things around the house, like plumbers and electricians. Tips are called ''borravaló'', "a little something for wine", in Hungarian.

Although not legally required, social norms encourage that tips are given. The amount varies by profession: in restaurants the normal amount is around 5% to 10% of the total bill, but hairdressers can expect 25% or more in tips, since they are expected to make more money in tips than in wages.

Additionally there is the custom of ''hálapénz'' (gratitude money) that may be classified as a tipping system in Hungarian doctors and nurses can often expect to receive fairly substantial sums of money or goods from their patients.

====Iceland====
In Iceland tipping (''þjórfé'', lit. "drink money") is rare. Service charges are generally included in the bill.<ref name="DHL">DHL. "[http://www.dhl-usa.com/IntlSvcs/Cultural/CulturalTips.asp?nav=InternationalSeunrvice/CultTips Cultural Tips]." ''How to Ship Internationally''.</ref>

====Ireland====
In the Republic of Ireland, tipping has not been established as a custom, though has become much more commonplace in the period of increased wealth through the Celtic Tiger. Many people working in the service industry, particularly in restaurants, would expect a tip. It is increasingly common to tip hairdressers/barbers and for a taxi ride; the fare would normally be rounded up. It is not customary to tip bar staff, or any 'over the counter' server, though often waiters in pubs (known as lounge staff) are tipped a token amount. It is not usual to tip in a restaurant when a service charge is included (which is the norm for large groups), except in the case of exceptional service. Where no service charge is indicated, a tip of about 10% to 12% is appropriate for good service.

====Italy====
Tips (''la mancia'') are customary in Italy, but not essential. The tradition of the tip remains impervious to change, even though café or restaurant prices now more and more often include both cover charge and service. On paying the bill, if it is paid in cash it is a matter of leaving a few notes from the change, or saying to the waiter "va bene così" ("it's all right"), when the difference between the amount paid and the actual bill automatically becomes the tip. When using a credit card, there are two possibilities: if the total on the credit card slip is the same as the bill, again leave some notes as a tip; but if the amount or the total are blank, simply round up the total to include the tip when signing the credit card slip.. Tipping in bars and discotheques is not expected and very rare.

====The Netherlands====

In Dutch, are common in restaurants. Tips are expected to be around 5% to 10% of the total amount (depending on the quality of service), unless the service has been poor. Tips are generally not expected in bars, but are not uncommon. In addition, in the holiday season, it is customary for the newspaper delivery person to receive a tip of around 2.50 to 5.

====Romania====
The tip is usually 10% of the bill and is expected in restaurants, coffee shops, taxi, hair dresser. Many other shops not frequented by westerners refuse tips, perceiving them as a form of bribery.

====Russia====
In Russian) is not necessary. Still, it is necessary to pay about 10% tips in restaurants, especially in Moscow. Some restaurants may include service into the amount, but it's very rare. Tipping is not considered customary for taxis.

====Serbia====
Tipping is known as ''напојница''/''napojnica'' or, more colloquially, ''бакшиш''/''bakšiš'' (''Serbian. Tips are not considered a strict social obligation, however leaving a tip (10-15%) is usually expected in restaurants if the customer is not dissatisfied with the service. Tips are also accepted in bars and taxi cabs (usually by rounding up the amount paid).

Un '''pourboire''' est une somme d'argent ou une libéralité versée à une personne en remerciement d'un service ou de la qualité de celui-ci. Les pourboires ne sont pas vus de la même manière selon les secteurs d'activité, les pays et les personnes.

== Europe ==
=== Allemagne ===
En Allemagne, on a habitude de donner un pourboire (allemand: ''Trinkgeld'') entre 5% et 10% du montant payé. On fait ainsi dans les restaurants, les estaminets et parfois chez le coiffeur. On ne donne pas de pourboire dans des snack-bars ou quand on est servi par le patron lui-même. Des pourboires minimaux sont considérés comme injurieux ; il vaut même mieux de ne pas en donner du tout. Au contraire de la France, en Allemagne le pourboire n'est normalement pas laissé à la table, mais on le donne directement au serveur.

=== Autriche ===
===Danemark, Suède et Norvège===
=== Espagne ===
===Finlande===
=== France ===
En France, le pourboire est peu répandu, le service étant inclus dans le prix. Néanmoins, il est d'usage d'arrondir par excès le prix lorsqu'on est satisfait du service, par exemple en laissant un peu de monnaie sur la table.

=== Islande ===
===Irlande===

=== Italie ===
Il est déconseillé de donner un pourboire à un serveur en Italie. Ce geste, comme au Japon, est considéré comme une insulte : vous faites comprendre que le gérant ne paie pas assez ses employés.

===République tchèque===
=== Royaume-Uni ===
===Slovénie===
=== Suisse ===

== Asie ==
=== Chine ===
===Corée du Sud===
=== Japon ===
Le pourboire est généralement déconseillé au Japon car il pourrait être considéré comme une insulte au serveur.

=== Malaisie ===
===Taïwan===
== Autres pays ==

=== Maroc ===
Au maroc, on donne un pourboire souvent aux serveurs dans un café ou un restaurant et aux chauffeurs des taxis (que les petits taxis lol). En général, c'est entre -10% ^^ et 20% ou même 30% à 40% (lorsque le montant est de quelques dirhams ).

=== Afrique du Sud ===
En Afrique du Sud, il est précisé sur les menus et les notes des restaurants (tout particulièrement dans les endroits touristiques) que le service n'est pas inclus dans le prix et qu'il est d'usage de laisser un pourboire de 10% à 15% du montant de la note. Il y a d'ailleurs un endroit où renseigner le montant laissé comme pourboire, la somme note + pourboire étant alors calculée par le serveur et pouvant être payés en une transaction, éventuellement même par carte bleue. Ces pourboires, généralement supérieurs à la moyenne, sont remboursables car figurant sur la note de frais.
