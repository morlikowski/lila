'''Hizb ut-Tahrir''' (; ) is a internationalist Sunni, anti-nationalist, pan-Islamist vanguard<ref></ref> political party whose goal is to unite all Muslim countries in a unitary Islamic state or caliphate, ruled by Islamic law and headed by an elected head of state ''(caliph)''.<ref>[http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.info/english/constitution.htm Draft Constitution] Article 16</ref> 

west, particularly in the United Kingdom. 

The party promotes "an elaborate and detailed program for instituting an Islamist state"<ref>[http://users.dickinson.edu/~commins/TaqiAl-dinAl-Nabhani.pdf Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani and the HT Party]</ref> which will "establish the laws of the Islamic Shariah and to carry the Da'wah of Islam to the world."<ref>[http://www.khilafah.com/kcom/the-khilafah/issues/ The Re-establishment of the Khilafah is an obligation upon all Muslims]</ref> It believes this "comprehensive solution" will provide "sincere leadership that cares for and protects its citizens from the colonial foreign policies of Bush and Blair" and bring an end to "US interventions, energy inspired wars, puppet (Muslim) governments and western values forced by the barrel of a gun."<ref>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/htb-national-events/htb-demonstration-to-the-us-embassy.html HT Demonstration to the U.S. Embassy]</ref> HT is strongly anti-Zionist and calls for "the dismantling of the illegal entity of Israel," whose leadership "has never concealed its hatred of Muslims and have been calling for the destruction of Muslims since the very beginning."<ref>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/resources/issues-explained/the-zionist-hatred.html HT article: The Zionist Hatred]</ref> HT believes a caliphate "will provide stability and security to all the people of the region, Muslims and Non-Muslims".<ref>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/resources/issues-explained/israels-attacks-are-uniting-muslims-throughout-the-world.html HT article: Israeli aggression is the root cause of this disaster]</ref>

Observers differ as to whether HT is a victim of unjust and untrue allegations of connections to terrorism, <ref>[http://icssa.org/article_detail_parse.php?a_id=1150&rel=1144,1136,1129 Pakistan’s Tableeghi Jamaat and Hizb-ut-Tahrir in Central Asia]</ref> or is only opposed to "the use of violence now," not to "violence as such."<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/hizb-ut-tahrir.htm Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami] on Global Security.org</ref>

==Aims and methods==
The stated aim of Hizb ut-Tahrir is to unite all Muslim nations in a unitary Islamic state or caliphate, headed by an elected caliph.<ref>[http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.info/english/constitution.htm Draft Constitution] Article 16</ref> This it holds is a religious duty, "an obligation that Allah has decreed for the Muslims and commanded them to fulfill. He warned of the punishment awaiting those who neglect this duty."<ref>[http://www.khilafat.pk/28rajab/books/the_islamic_state.pdf The Islamic State, p.9] </ref>
According to the BBC, the group "professes non-violence and calls for the return in Muslim majority countries to the caliphate which oversaw the golden age of Islam before European imperialism colonized the Middle East."<ref name=BBCAPOLOGISM>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2006/03/14/kurt_met_police_trust_feature.shtml Who's Listening to Whom?]</ref> According to GlobalSecurity.org, Hizb ut-Tahrir is a "secretive sectarian group," that is "not against violence as such. It is just against the use of violence now."<ref>[www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/hizb-ut-tahrir.htm Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami (Islamic Party of Liberation)]</ref> 

Although ''hizb'' means party in Arabic, according to Zeyno Baran of the Washington based Nixon Center think tank, HT doesn't register as a political party or attempt to elect candidates to political office in the countries where it is active.<ref>"Fighting the War of Ideas", Zeyno Baran. Foreign Affairs. New York: Nov/Dec 2005.Vol.84, Iss. 6; pg. 79</ref> Nor does it engage in charitable or social service projects like the Muslim Brotherhood.<ref name="allahandthecaliphate" /> Hizb ut-Tahrir's focus is on "ideological struggle" to establish its vision of the caliphate in the minds of Muslims.

This is not true in all countries or throughout HT history, however as HT has been involved in aid to needy Muslims in Indonesia and other countries.<ref>[http://www.indonesia-relief.org/mod.php?mod=bank&op=infobank&bankid=163 Tsunami Relief Database - Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  When it was first founded, HT ''did'' register as a public political organisation and stood for parliamentary seats in Jordan in the 1950s, according to Suha Taji-Farouki. The group was banned by the regime at the time and its 'legal' status did not resume until the organisation was legalised in Lebanon in May 2006.<ref>http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2479</ref> 
Kyrgyz Hizb ut-Tahrir members campaigned unsuccessfully for an affiliated candidate in Kyrgyzstan's national presidential election in July 2005,<ref name=KYRGYZSTAN/> and have participated in municipal elections where their followers have won in a number of regions<ref>"Evolution of political regimes in Central Asia: ways and opportunities" Ferghana. Ru Information Agency [http://enews.ferghana.ru/article.php?id=1862]</ref>

Hizb ut-Tahrir has set out a three-stage plan of action to achieve its goals:
#Establish a community of HuT members who work together in the same way as the companions of Muhammad. Members should accept the goals and methods of the organization as their own and be ready to work to fulfill these goals.<ref name=SAHABA>[http://www.risala.org/books/1.Hizb-ut-Tahrir-new.pdf Untitled] Hizb ut-Tahrir</ref>
#Build public opinion among the Muslim masses for the caliphate and the other Islamic concepts that will lead to a revival of Islamic thought.<ref name=SAHABA/>
#Once public opinion is achieved in a target country through debate and persuasion, the group hopes to obtain support from army generals, leaders, and other influential figures or bodies to facilitate the change of the government. The government would be replaced by one that implements Islam "generally and comprehensively", carrying Islamic thought to people throughout the world.<ref name=SAHABA/>
A less sympathetic description of HuT plan by Dosym Satpayev, director of a Kazakh think tank  Assessment Risks Group, is that HuT <blockquote>"plans its development in three stages... First they convert new members. Secondly, they establish a network of secret cells, and finally, they try to infiltrate the government to work to legalize their party and its aims."<ref name=KYRGYZSTAN>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4531848.stm Central Asia's Islamic militancy] BBC News</ref> </blockquote> 

Talking to the BBC, an Indonesian party member described the "method used in Hizb ut-Tahrir" as "a change in thought patterns. We call it 'thought revolution'. When someone is given Islamic teaching - given the brilliant thinking of Islam - then they'll naturally undergo a thought revolution ... " According to the BBC, "unlike many other Islamist movements here, Hizb ut-Tahrir seems less interested in a broad mass following than a smaller more committed core of members, many of them drawn from Indonesia's educated middle classes."<ref>[http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6943070.stm BBC: Stadium crowd pushes for Islamist dream]</ref>

Hizb ut-Tahrir's organisation is said to be strongly centralized with its central leadership based in Palestine. Underneath its center are "national organisations or wilayas, usually headed by a group of 12, control networks of local committees and cells." New members "spend at least two years studying party literature, under the guidance of mentors," before taking an oath of loyalty to the party. "A parallel, separate structure exists for women, who are encouraged to become fully active members."<ref name="allahandthecaliphate" />

The basic unit of the party is a cell of five members, the leader of which is called a ''mushrif.'' At least in areas where the party is illegal, such as Central Asia, only the ''mushrif'' knows the names of members of other cells.<ref>Abou Zahab, Mariam; Roy, Olivier, ''Islamist Networks, Columbia University Press, (2004), p.9-10</ref>

==Leadership==
Founder Taqiuddin al-Nabhani died in 1977 and was succeeded by Abd al-Qadim Zallum who was succeeded in turn by Ata Khalil Abu-Rashta when Zallum died in 2003.

==Policies==
===Rights or freedoms===
Hizb ut-Tahrir rejects the notion of absolute freedom in religion or capitalism. Article 7 of its Draft Constitution declares that Muslims who "have by themselves renounced Islam ... are guilty of apostasy (murtad) from Islam [and] are to be executed." 
Professor David Commins of Department of History at Dickinson College, writes that according to Hizb ut-Tahrir, "individuals do not have absolute freedom as in capitalism: Apostasy, adultery, alcohol, and certain economic practices are forbidden. But within well-recognized bounds, the Muslim enjoys much freedom.<ref>[http://users.dickinson.edu/~commins/TaqiAl-dinAl-Nabhani.pdf Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani ...]</ref>

The Hizb ut-Tahrir party's draft constitution argues that "there is no such thing as a no person shall be punished without a court sentence" and that "torture is absolutely forbidden and whoever inflicts torture on anyone shall be punished." Article 7 of the constitution institutes capital punishment for ''ridda'' (see ridda article for various definitions).  It maintains that under the caliphate, "Arabic is the language of Islam and the sole language of the state." 

The only sources of legislation to be considered divine & statutory, and therefore to be accepted without debate, according to Article 12, are those based upon fair interpretations of the Qur'an, the Sunnah, consensus ''(ijma)'', and legitimate analogies (Qiyas) from the previous three.

===Democracy===
Hizb ut-tahrir rejects democracy as western and unislamic. Hizb ut-tahrir argues democracy is 
<BLOCKQUOTE>the rule of people, for the people, by the people.  The basis of the democratic system is that people possess the right of sovereignty, choice and implementation. ... it is a Kufr system because it is laid down by man and it is not from the Shari'ah Laws.</BLOCKQUOTE>
However as a Sunni Muslim organization, HT believes the Caliph, i.e the head of the Caliphate state, should not be inherited through blood lines or imposed on Muslims, but elected by them. Muslims should then pledge their loyalty to the Caliph. The Caliph 
<blockquote> "is the head of state in the Khilafah. He is not a king or dictator but an elected leader whose authority to rule must be given willingly by the Muslims through a special ruling contact called baya. Without this baya he cannot be the head of state. This is completely opposite to a king or dictator who imposes his authority through coercion and force. The tyrant kings and dictators in the Muslim world are ample examples of this, imprisoning and torturing the Muslims and stealing their wealth and resources."[http://www.khilafah.com/kcom/the-khilafah/issues/what-is-the-khilafah-caliphate.html]</blockquote>
HT favor a system of elections for Muslims to chose the Caliph and other ruling officials.

Also part of the HT proposed draft constitution is a Majlis al-Umma for the Caliph to consult. 

The founder of Hizb ut-Tahrir, Taqiuddin an-Nabhani, is careful to note that Shura differs from Western representative democracy in that while part of the "the ruling structure" of the Islamic caliphate, it's "not one of its pillars." 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is because the shura (consultation) in Islam is for seeking the opinion and not for ruling. This is contrary to the parliamentary system in democracy.<ref>[http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.org/PDF/EN/en_books_pdf/system_of_islam.pdf ''The System of Islam, (Nidham ul Islam)'' by Taqiuddin an-Nabhani], Al-Khilafa Publications, 1423 AH - 2002 CE, p.61</ref></BLOCKQUOTE>

In another book Nabhani takes a somewhat different line, stating that when the Majlis makes a decision on internal issues it is binding on the Caliph to accept the decision; the Caliph's powers outlined in the draft proposed constitution refer only to foreign affairs when in a state of war which he considered existent during his life.<ref>''Nethaam al-Huqm fil-Islam'', Chapter entitled Majlis al-Ummah</ref>

===Women===
The HT draft constitution states, "The primary role of a woman is that of a mother and wife. She is an honour ('ird) that must be protected."<ref>[http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.info/english/constitution.htm Draft Constitution Article 108]</ref>. Unlike some Muslim traditionalists, Hizb ut-Tahrir, advocates women's suffrage or right to vote (i.e. Muslim women, as only Muslims have the right to vote for the Caliph<ref>Hizb ut-Tahrir draft constitution, art. 26</ref>), the right of Muslim women to choose a Muslim partner freely (Muslim women are not allowed to marry non-Muslim men), right to seek employment, have custody of children after divorce even if she is not Muslim<ref>[http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.info/english/constitution.htm Draft Constitution Article 118 states "The custody of children is both a right and duty of the mother, whether Muslim or not, so long as the child is in need of this care. - The latter statement refers to when the child is mature"]</ref>), and run in elections. 

However, under HT rule, women would be barred from the ruling positions such as provincial governor, or mayor. Article 109 of the party's draft constitution prescribes segregation of the sexes in public activities such as school, sporting activities, etc. Muslim women would be required to hide “their charms,”<ref>Hizb ut-Tahrir draft constitution, art. 114</ref> i.e. their body with the exception of hands and face, so dress in accordance with ''khimar'' and ''jilbab,''<ref name=JILBAB>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=544&Itemid=112 Re: 'Of course women have a right to choose. But agreeing to wear a jilbab is no choice at all'] Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain</ref> although not necessarily with the niqab favoured by more fundamentalist movements.<ref>''images of women's section'': [http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&hl=en&lr=&q=hizb+tahrir+women&btnG=Search hizb tahrir women] Google Images</ref><ref>Although HT defends the right of women to choose the wearing of a niqab. [http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=721&Itemid=184 Playing Politics with Communities: A Response from Dr Nazreen Nawaz] Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain</ref>   Article 114 of the constitution specifies that women should not be allowed to be in private with men other than their husband or members of their immediate family (father, brother, son).  Article 116 stipulates that once married a woman is obliged to obey her husband.<ref>Hizb ut-Tahrir draft constitution, art. 116</ref>

While opponents may consider this unequal status, HT maintains <blockquote>Women in the Khilafah are not regarded as inferior or second class citizens. Islam gave women the right to wealth, property rights, rights over marriage and divorce as well as a place in society. Islam established a public dress code for women – the Khimar and Jilbab in order to establish a productive society free from the type of negative and harmful relationships prevalent in the west.<ref>[http://www.khilafah.com/kcom/the-khilafah/issues/what-is-the-khilafah-caliphate.html what is the khilafah caliphate]</ref></blockquote>

===Zionism===
HT strongly opposes Zionism and the current state of Israel. It pledges supports for a "one state solution" for Israel and the Palestinians. However, by the phrase "one state solution" HT does not mean a secular state (see: Binational solution), rather, HT aims for a state where Palestinians and Israelis, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, live together under the caliphate system with statutory Islamic law.<ref> Why Only a One state solution will work by Hizb ut-Tahrir [http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/resources/issues-explained/palestine---why-only-a-one-state-solution-will-work.html] </ref>

===Non-Muslims===
In HuT's draft constitution for an Islamic state, non-Muslims may voice "complaints in respect to unjust acts performed by the rulers or the misapplication of Islam upon them," but may not serve in any of the ruling offices, such as the position of caliph, nor vote for these officials. "Every mature male and female Muslim, who is sane, has the right to participate in the election of the Khaleefah [head of state] and in giving him the pledge (ba'iah). Non-Muslims have no right in this regard." 
Hizb ut-Tahrir has argued that Muslims have a special responsibility to respect the rights of non-Muslims. 
<blockquote>"The rights of Jews and other non-Muslims are enshrined within statuary Islamic Law (Sharia). These were laid down by the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) when he established the first Islamic State in Medina in the 7th century. He (saw) said, "Whoever harms a dhimmi (non-Muslim citizen) has harmed me." ...  "Non-Muslims in the khilafah (caliphate) will have established channels to air any grievances or denial of their rights. All citizens will be empowered with the right to speak out where necessary."<ref name=ABRAHAMIC>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=253&Itemid=140 Minorities in the new Middle East of the Caliphate] Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain</ref></blockquote>
The above statement indicates a distinction between statutory Islamic law, and non-statutory Islamic law regarding the rights of non-Muslims.

In foreign policy association with non-Islamic organizations is forbidden. Article 186 of the draft constitution states: "The State is forbidden to belong to any organisation that is based on something other than Islam ''or'' which applies non-Islamic rules". They also view the Islamic law and being oppressive to the developing world. Article 185 of the draft constitution states: "It is permitted to conclude good neighbouring, economic, commercial, financial, cultural and armistice treaties."

===The West===
HT takes a strong stand against Western influence in the Muslim world. Its founder, Nabhani, has been described as preaching that "British plots in particular and western imperialist conspiracies in general pervade the modern history of the Muslim world and ultimately explain its main lines of political evolution."<ref>[http://users.dickinson.edu/~commins/TaqiAl-dinAl-Nabhani.pdf Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani and the HT Party]</ref> In his book, ''The System of Islam,'' which is studied by all HT members, Nabhani describes the Western culture and its "agents" as the one thing standing in the way of resurgent Caliphate. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>If it was not for influence of the deceptive Western culture and the oppression of its agents which will soon vanish, then the return to the domain of Islam in its ideology and system would be quicker than the blink of an eye.<ref>[http://www.khilafat.pk/28rajab/books/nidham.pdf system of islam] p.64</ref></BLOCKQUOTE>

While some believe the Muslim world lags behind the West or East Asia because of Muslim failure to borrow some political, cultural or social concepts of the West, the book argues that in fact Muslim stagnation 

<BLOCKQUOTE>commenced the day they abandoned this adherence to Islam and ... allowed the foreign culture to enter their lands and the Western concepts to occupy their minds.<ref>[http://www.khilafat.pk/28rajab/books/nidham.pdf system of islam] p.73</ref></BLOCKQUOTE>

===Economy===
The draft constitution also details an economic system which allows private enterprise, but reserves public ownership of utilities, public transport, health care, energy resources such as oil, and unused farm land (similar to moderate forms of Socialism).  It calls for use of the Gold Standard, gold and silver coinage and gives quite specific instructions for the gold and silver weight of the coins, arguing 
<blockquote>... it is the duty of the Khilafah State to make its currency in gold and silver and to work on the basis of gold and silver as it was during the time of the Messenger of Allah  and his Khulafa'a after him...to fix the weight of dinars equal to the Shari'ah dinar or 4.25 grams (of Gold) for one dinar...the dirham has the weight of 2.975 grams (of Silver). The basis of gold and silver as currency is the only way to solve currency related economic problems and the high inflation rates that are common in the world, and to produce currency stability for rates of exchange and progress in international trade. ... Only by taking gold and silver as the standard, can the American control and the control of the dollar as an international currency, be demolished in international trade and world economies.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20040704022600/http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.org/english/books/hizb-ut-tahrir/chapter_09.html The Necessity of money being in Gold and Silver ]</ref></blockquote>

===Defence===
Article 56 of the draft constitution of the proposed state describes conscription as a compulsory individual duty, for all citizens. Muslim males past the age of 15 would be obliged to undergo military conscription on the basis of this being a collective duty. Responsibility for defense in the state would go to the ''Amir al-Jihad.''

==The anti-semitism controversy==
In a 2000 article entitled "The Muslim Ummah will never submit to the Jews", Hizb ut-Tahrir lamented what it saw as the innate behavior of the Jews: Jews

<blockquote>...  insist on expelling more and more of the people of Palestine so that they can bring in more of the world's Jews. They are demolishing homes, confiscating land and property, imprisoning people, torturing them, breaking their bones and killing them...They violate agreements and are disloyal to the treaties they have signed. They violate the airspace and waters of Lebanon every day and with their arms they bomb its cities and villages. They have occupied the lands of Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, and they increase daily in their provocation and defiance to all the Arabs and Muslims.... In origin, no one likes the American people do not like the Jews nor do the Europeans, because the Jews by their very nature do not like anyone else. Rather they look at other people as wild animals which have to be tamed to serve them. So, how can we imagine it being possible for any Arab or Muslim to like the Jews whose character is such? ... Know that the Jews and their usurping state in Palestine will, by the Help and Mercy of Allah, be destroyed "until the stones and trees will say: O Muslim, O Slave of Allah. Here is a Jew behind me so come and kill him."<ref name=NOJEWS>[http://archive.bibalex.org/web/20010305125154/hizb-ut-tahrir.org/english/leaflets/palestine31199.htm The Muslim Ummah will never submit to the Jews] Hizb ut-Tahrir</ref></blockquote>

In October 2002, a court in Denmark handed down a 60-day suspended sentence to Fadi Abdelatif, Hizb ut-Tahrir's spokesman in Denmark, after he was found guilty of distributing racist propaganda. The title of a leaflet he distributed was a quote from Muhammad: "And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out." The hadith refers to the situation at the time the Antichrist (dajjal) has descended and the Muslims stand united fighting the Jews, who will take the Antichrist to be their God and Saviour. With the help of Isa, even the stones and rocks will call out and say, "There is a Jew standing behind me, come and kill this Jew"<ref name=DENMARK>[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,15935,1543732,00.html Banned groups with roots in UK appeal to disaffected young Muslims], ''The Guardian''.</ref> The leaflet continues: "The Jews are a people of slander ... a treacherous people ... they fabricate lies and twist words from their right context." 

In January 2003, Hizb ut-Tahrir was barred in Germany from public activity on charges of spreading antisemitic propaganda and of being "hate preachers." Membership in the party is still permitted. German Interior Minister Otto Schily ruled that the group was "spreading hate and violence," and had called for the killing of Jews.<ref name=Lambroschini>Lambroschini, Sophie. [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/10/a9e085a9-a771-4e5c-b41d-16b3d7d1258f.html "Germany: Court Appeal By Hizb Ut-Tahrir Highlights Balancing Act Between Actions, Intentions"], Radio Free Europe, October 26, 2004.</ref> The charges originate from a conference at the Technical University of Berlin, organized by a student society allegedly affiliated with Hizb ut-Tahrir. The furore was caused because the conference was attended by members of the neo-nazi National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) sparking fears about an alliance between neo-Nazi groups and Islamists. Schily banned Hizb ut-Tahrir three months later for going "against the concept of international understanding" contained in the German constitution, a charge that has been used in the past against neo-Nazi groups.

In July 2005 Dilpazier Aslam, a 27-year-old British Muslim and trainee journalist with ''The Guardian'', lost his position with the newspaper when it was exposed he was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir. Citing the antisemitic statement discovered on the party's website, ''Guardian'' executives decided that membership of Hizb ut-Tahrir was not compatible with membership of the newspaper's trainee scheme. Aslam refused to leave the group, saying he was not an antisemite and did not consider Hizb ut-Tahrir's website to be antisemitic.<ref name=GuardianAslam/> Dilpazier later sued for unfair dismissal and there was an out-of-court settlement.<ref name=GuardianAslam/>

After allegations that party members had spread antisemitic propaganda, in 2004 the British National Union of Students imposed a No Platform order.<ref>[http://www.nusonline.co.uk/news/270231.aspx "NUS representative addresses government committee on campus incitement"], NUS Online.</ref> The party then resumed recruiting at British universities under the name "Stop Islamophobia."<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1827988,00.html "'Stealth' Islamists recruit students"] ''The Sunday Times'', 16 October 2005.</ref> However, at a recent NUS Policy conference, motion 804, the conference believed that:

<blockquote> 
*24. A motion passed at 2004's NUS annual conference falsely accused the Islamic political party Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT) of being racist and extremist.  During the debate at conference, HT was wrongly accused of organising an event to celebrate the attacks in New York.
*26. Contrary to allegations of sexism and racism, HT has members from both sexes and different races and who came from Christian, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish and Atheist backgrounds.
...Conference resolved:
*25. To remove Hizb ut-Tahrir from NUS's no platform policy.<ref> NUS passed Policy: http://resource.nusonline.co.uk/media/resource/policy%20passed.doc </ref>
</blockquote>

===Response===
In response, Hizb ut-Tahrir stated:

<blockquote>We reject decisively the charge of anti-Semitism ... at the same time we decisively reject Zionism represented in the form of Israel...The state of Israel is founded upon a land that it took by force, after it drove out its people, both Muslim and Christian. This is injustice, which we will never accept from an Islamic perspective, regardless of the race of the perpetrators. In Palestine, Islam is in conflict with Israelis — not in their capacity as Jews who historically had lived alongside Muslims in peace and security for centuries — but in their capacity as occupiers and aggressors.</blockquote>

On August 15, 2005 British executive committee member Abdul-Wahid explained why the material was removed from the party's websites:

<blockquote>Some who do challenge our political views often resort to partial understandings of individual texts that are detached from context — either of the Muslim world or of global history in general. For example, the war rhetoric prevalent in Europe fifty years ago was full of derogatory epithets and proud declarations, but these are no longer seen as appropriate.

==Position on terrorism==

According to the New York Times, HT "explicitly condemns violence".<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/world/europe/12britain.html New York Times]</ref> On the other hand, both the BBC and the Guardian have cited the activities of Fadi Abdelatif in Denmark as evidence that HT members view Palestinian suicide bombings in Israel legitimate acts of resistance.<ref name=BBCmartyrdom>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/3182271.stm "Hizb ut Tahrir"], BBC News, August 27 2003.</ref><ref>[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,,1978581,00.html PM shelves Islamic group ban </ref>  Senior members of HT in Palestine have recently been quoted condemning Hamas, saying that an offensive against Israeli and its occupation of Palestinian lands should be wait for a united Caliphate and the combined armies of Islam, rather than sending poorly-armed Palestinians against the Israeli army in "fruitless" fighting.<ref> Muslim movement offers alternative to Hamas [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070822.whizb22/BNStory/International/home]</ref>

Critics have suggested that although HT opposes violence, its indoctrination creates an "environment" friendly to violent jihad, or that its opposition to violence is temporary, not general, and that it will support violence when a more favorable opportunity arises.  In another New Statesman article, Ziauddin Sardar claims that that while HT "has not, strictly speaking, advocated violence ... it certainly preaches engagement with violence,"<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/200511140010 Ziauddin Sardar explains the long history of violence behind Hizb ut-Tahrir]</ref>. Authors from some conservative American think-tanks (Zeyno Baran of the Nixon Centre, and Ariel Cohen of the Heritage Foundation<ref name="allahandthecaliphate" />) have argued that although HT may not promote or engage in violence, it acts as a "conveyor belt" for young Muslims, using its legal status to indoctrinate them before they leave HT to join more extreme groups which may advocate violence.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070822.whizb22/BNStory/International/home Globe and Mail: Muslim movement offers alternative to Hamas ]</ref> Shiv Malik says Hizb ut-Tahrir "has never been directly implicated in an act of violence"<ref name="allahandthecaliphate" /> but he argues the idea that HT members may leave the party and move on to violent organizations "is not without foundation." He quotes unnamed intelligence sources saying, "Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaeda's man in Iraq, is a former member of the Jordanian branch of Hizb. ... the al-Qaeda commander Khalid Sheikh Mohammed also spent time with the party." 

According to author Olivier Roy, "the Hizb ut-Tahrir position against the launching of jihad is purely tactical. The organization believes that the time has not yet come for jihad, but that it is a compulsory duty for any Muslim." <Ref>''Globalized Islam : the Search for a New Ummah,'' by Olivier Roy, Columbia University Press, 2004 p.256</ref>  Globalsecurity.org says much the same thing, calling HT "one of the most secretive fundamentalist Islamic organizations, it remains a radical organization. Hizb ut-Tahrir is not against violence as such. It is just against the use of violence now. But they still think jihad [holy war] is a positive concept."<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/hizb-ut-tahrir.htm Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami]</ref>

The Terrorism Research Centre complains that the initial response to the London 7/7 bombings by the website HT 1924.org was not to condemn the killing of civilians, "but to urge British Muslims to be strong in the face of an anticipated backlash.   The letter [on 1924.org] accuses [G-8] world leaders of taking advantage of the London attacks "to justify their ‘war on terror.'"<ref>[http://www.terrorism.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Intel&file=index&view=649 Hizb ut-Tahrir]</ref> The full statement quoted below however does show a condemnation of the terrorist attacks.

Accounts differ over whether there was any connection at all between HT and an attempted 2003 suicide bomber in Israel by British-born Omar Sharif.  An article by Shiv Malik in the New Statesman magazine quotes an old friend of Sharif who described him as "heavily attending all, absolutely all, HT-organised circles" in the first semester of University in 1994. It also reports that his E-mail inbox contained an HT mailshot with the words "' ... destroy the hegemony of the colonialist powers...". HT flatly denies that Sharif had any "affiliation whatsoever with Hizb ut-Tahrir," and says that, "despite extensive investigations by the police and security services, including legal proceedings against members of the Sharif family, no link to Hizb ut-Tahrir has ever been proven."<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/200604240017 NS Profile Omar Sharif]</ref> 

===Response===
Defenders say HT's use of the word jihad is not limited to violence. According to Jean-François Mayer of the University of Fribourg writing for the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs; ''"Hizb ut-Tahrir insists that Islam ‘obliges the Muslims to oppose the rulers with opinion [only] and to account them for their actions’, quoting the Messenger of Allah, who is reported to have said that ‘The best jihad is the word of truth spoken to a tyrant ruler’. This is exactly what Hizb ut-Tahrir has been doing in various parts of the world,"<ref name=AQLINK>[http://hei.unige.ch/psio/fichiers/Meyer%20Al%20Qaida.pdf Hizb ut-Tahrir – The Next Al-Qaida, Really ?] PSIO</ref>'' Mayer ridicules the insinuation that HT could turn violent in his paper ''"Hizb ut-Tahrir – The Next Al-Qaida, Really ?"''.

Noman Hanif concludes in one of his papers; ''"Attempts by US think tanks to insinuate a link between HT and terrorism in order to frame it under the war on terror have conclusively failed."<ref>"Pakistan’s Tableeghi Jamaat and Hizb-ut-Tahrir in Central Asia"'' [http://icssa.org/article_detail_parse.php?a_id=1150&rel=1144,1136,1129]</ref> 
 
===Russia and Central Asia government positions===
HT has been accused by the governments of Central Asia of terrorist activity or illegal importation of arms in the former Soviet Union. In 1999, HT "was blamed for a series of bomb attacks in the Uzbekistan capital, Tashkent," according to globalsecurity.org  HT "is believed by some to clandestinely fund and provide logistical support to a wide range of terrorist operations in Central Asia, and elsewhere, although attacks may be carried out in the names of local groups.".<ref name=MONITORING>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/hizb-ut-tahrir.htm Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami (Islamic Party of Liberation)] Global Security</ref>  The Uzbek government reportedly withdrew that accusation and blamed the IMU for those attacks, nevertheless human rights organizations and a former British Ambassador have accused central Asian governments of torturing HT members and violating international law. [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/03/29/uzbeki8309.htm]

In February 2003, the Russian Supreme Court put "Hizb ut-Tahrir and 14 other groups on a list of banned terrorist organizations."<ref name=MONITORING> The Russian government banned HT not for any terrorist activity, but because their definition of terrorism includes anyone who supports Chechen rebels in their cause for independence from Russia [http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/9142-19.cfm]</ref>  In June 2003 Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) arrested 121 illegal immigrants suspected of having ties with Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami. "Moscow media reports said hand grenades, explosives, and ammunition ... as well as Islamic propaganda leaflets" were found on two of immigrants, Alisher Musayev of Kyrgyzstan and Akram Jalolov of Tajikistan.<ref name=MONITORING>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/hizb-ut-tahrir.htm Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami (Islamic Party of Liberation)] Global Security</ref></blockquote> 

====Response====
However human rights groups and Russian Muslims have complained that authorities are increasingly becoming repressive and have planted evidence on Muslims to justify charges.<ref>[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/9142-19.cfm Johnson's Russia List]</ref>.<ref>[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/08/16/kyrgyz16698.htm kyrgyz]</ref> The Russian governments position has been severely criticized by Russian human rights groups, specifically Memorial [http://www.memo.ru/eng/] who questioned the validity of the ban, and were consequently threatened by the government not to reveal its findings [http://www.memo.ru/eng/memhrc/texts/2006ponomarevriabinina.shtml] 

===U.S. government position===
Global Security has stated that: 
<blockquote>"The United States Government is continuing to monitor Hizb ut-Tahrir. Despite the statements of governments of the region, the United States has found no clear ties between Hizb ut-Tahrir and terrorist activity. Hizb ut-Tahrir has not been proven to have involvement in or direct links to any recent acts of violence or terrorism. Nor has it been proven to give financial support to other groups engaged in terrorism. Because of that, it falls outside the definitions used by the United States and others to designate a terrorist group."<ref name=MONITORING>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/hizb-ut-tahrir.htm Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami (Islamic Party of Liberation)] Global Security</ref></blockquote>

===UK government position===
According to a leaked unpublished government report produced for Tony Blair, revealed to The Guardian Newspaper printed on 8 August 2005, the prime minister has been advised that the party is not involved in violence or terrorism. A paper called ‘Young Muslims and Extremism’, was prepared for Mr Blair on the orders of the home and foreign secretaries. It says: <blockquote>"Most of the structured organisations, e.g. Hizb ut-Tahrir, will not directly advocate violence. Indeed membership or sympathy with such an organisation does not in any way presuppose a move towards terrorism."</blockquote> The document adds that young people attracted to terrorism may shy away from HT because they do not espouse violence, and would be seen as only engaged in ''"pointless pontification and debate"''. UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister Bill Rammell argued that;

'''Hizb ut-Tahrir''' ou le Parti de la Libération (islamiste banni dans la majorité des pays.

L'objectif du ''Hizb ut-Tahrir'' est d'établir un califat islamique. L'organisation a été créée à l'instigation de Cheikh Taqiuddin an-Nabhani, un cadi de Jérusalem en 1953. Le ''Hizb ut-Tahrir'' se présente comme une organisation non-violente et condamne le recours aux attentats sauf en Israël.

Actif surtout en Asie centrale, il y est fortement réprimé par les régimes au pouvoir, comme au Turkménistan ou en Ouzbékistan.

Lors de la crise internationale des caricatures de Mahomet, le 11 février 2006, des membres du ''Hizb ut-Tahrir'' ont manifesté dans la capitale indonésienne Jakarta notamment devant l'ambassade du Danemark. Les 500 manifestants affirmaient que les caricatures s'inscrivaient dans « ''une guerre contre l'Islam''.»<ref>Source : ''Le Nouvel Observateur'' du 11.02.06.</ref> Les slogans étaient du type « ''Massacrez ceux qui insultent l'islam'' » et « ''Europe, ton 11 septembre va venir'' ».

Malgré tout, certains soupçonnent cette organisation de servir les intérêts américains ou britanniques, dans le même esprit qui consiste à constater que les attentats du 11 septembre ont augmenté le pouvoir des États-Unis dans le monde.
