'''''The Real Thing''''' is the third album by  heavy metal, hip hop, soul. The music recording was complete by the time Patton (the singer for experimental/thrash/funk band Mr. Bungle) came on board. Patton wrote the lyrics and recorded them over the already finished music.<ref name="fnm.bio">The biography page on [http://www.fnm.com/band/ fnm.com], retrieved february 22, 2008</ref>

Most known for its tracks "Falling to Pieces," and "Epic," whose video featured a fish flopping about on the ground, the album's "Falling to Pieces" also became popular (its video was a favorite of MTV's ''Beavis and Butthead'').  The video for "Epic" was subject to controversy because of the perceived treatment of the fish, which appears to be dying—it was in fact slow motion footage; the fish was returned to its tank alive.<ref name=faq15>[http://www.fnm.com/faq/#15 Q15] on the fnm.com FAQ, retrieved february 22, 2008</ref> Reportedly, keyboardist Roddy Bottum stole the goldfish from Icelandic singer Björk at a party she was throwing. He returned it to her after the shoot, which lasted mere seconds. Mike Patton claimed during the band's "Live at the Wireless" performance for Australian radio station Triple J, in 1990, that the title track was "Written after my girlfriend left me for Sebastian Bach."

''The Real Thing'' is Faith No More's best selling album, selling 2 million copies in the US alone and around 4 million worldwide. Singles released were "Epic", "From Out Of Nowhere", "Falling To Pieces" and "Edge Of The World" of this album. "Epic" also ranked #30 in VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs in May 2006.

The album also features "War Pigs," a cover of the anti-war protest song by Black Sabbath, as well as "Edge of the World," a jazzy piano ballad about a paedophile. "Surprise! You're Dead!" also had a video that never saw much airplay on TV.

"Epic" is featured in the video games ''Rock Band, Burnout Paradise, and Singstar (PS3)''.

'''''The Real Thing''''', sorti en 1989, est le troisième album du groupe Faith No More, et le premier avec le chanteur Mike Patton.
Plus de deux millions d'exemplaires de l'album se sont vendus aux États Unis.

Mike Patton se trouva dans l'urgence de devoir composer tous les textes de l'album. La publication vit le jour le 7 mars disque de platine), et dont le refrain disait « What is it ? ».

C'est avec ce titre que le triomphe commercial de Faith No More débutera. Leur premier clip sera abondamment diffusé sur « Empty V » (MTV), la chaîne « créatrice de succès », et leur permettra de devenir disque de platine à la fin de l'année 1989.
