'''Гуджаратский погром''' - серия межрелигиозных столкновений между индусами и мусульманами в индийском штате Гуджарат, произошедшие в феврале-марте 2002 года. Наиболее ожесточенные столкновения произошли в Ахмадабаде.

==Повод==
Поводом к погрому стал поджог пассажирского поезда с индуистскими паломниками возле станции Годхра 27 декабря 2002 года. Тогда заживо сгорели 58 человек. В поджоге был обвинен мусульманин, мотивом которого была религиозная неприязнь. Многие паломники были членами праворадикальной организации Вишва Хинду Паришад (ВХП), выступающей за строительство индуистского храма в городе Айодхья на месте разрушенной в 1992 мечети [http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/news/newsid_1846000/1846120.stm]. 
==Жертвы==
В результате погрома погибло около 1000 мусульман. Женщины-мусульманки подвергались групповому изнасилованию [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7196017.stm].

The '''2002 Gujarat violence''' describes a series of communal State of Gujarat between February and May 2002.

According to official figures more than a thousand people were killed in the violence. Independent estimates by rights groups and NGOs place the figure higher, nearer to 2000. More than one hundred and fifty thousand people were displaced.

Organisations such as Indian government for failure to address the resulting humanitarian condition of people, "overwhelming majority of them Muslim," who fled their homes for relief camps in the aftermath of the events. <ref>[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2002/04/30/india3885.htm Gujarat Officials Took Part in Anti-Muslim Violence -Human Rights Watch]</ref> Many of the investigations and prosecution of those accused of violence during the riots have been opened for reinvestigation and prosecution.<ref name=BBC1 /><ref name=BBC2 />

The large-scale, collective violence has been generally been described as riots or inter-communal clashes.<ref>[http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070036747&ch=12/23/2007%2011:14:00%20PM Riot connection fails to upset Modi] NDTV - December 23, 2007; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4536199.stm Gujarat riot death toll revealed] BBC News - May 11, 2005; [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/My_murders_are_better_than_yours/articleshow/2677642.cms  My murders are better than yours] Sangh parivar leaders<ref>, </ref> and the Gujarat government<ref></ref><ref name="BBC-19-Mar-02"></ref><ref name="Punj">[http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?sid=1&fodname=20020527&fname=Column+Balbir+%28F%29 Fiddling with facts as Gujarat Burns],''Outlook India''</ref> maintain that the violence was a spontaneous, uncontrollable, indeed justifiable, reaction to the Godhra train burning. 
Others have termed it a massacre<ref></ref> and an attempted pogrom or genocide<ref></ref> of the Muslim population, emphasizing that the violence was largely directed against defenceless people, indiscriminate with regard to age or sex and alleging that it was pre-planned, organised and aided by the local authorities and political leaders.<ref>Brass (2005), pp. 387</ref>

==Godhra train burning==

On February 27 2002, 58 people, including 25 women and 15 children<ref></ref> were burnt alive in a railway coach in the town of Godhra following an altercation between local Muslims and activists of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (Kar Sevaks) returning by the Sabarmathi express train from Ayodhya.<ref></ref> Initial media reports blamed the local Muslims for setting the coach on fire,<ref>   </ref> in what Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and the VHP leader Giriraj Kishore alleged was a "pre-planned" attack.<ref></ref><ref></ref> 

The bodies of those killed in the train were brought to Ahmedabad, where a procession was held,<ref></ref> a move seen as a major provocation for the ensuing communal violence.<ref>{{cite news | title = Modi wanted Godhra bodies to come to A'bad

==Post Godhra violence==
151 towns and 993 villages<ref name="Oommen-2005">Figure reported by the Gujarat additional director general of police to the Election Commission, </ref> in fifteen to sixteen of the state's 25 districts were affected by the post-Godhra violence, which was particularly severe in about five or six districts. The violence raged largely between February 28 and March 3, and after a drop, restarted on March 15, continuing till mid June.<ref name="Brass-2005"></ref> Northern and central Gujarat, as well as the north-eastern tribal belt where Hindutva mobilisation efforts were strong, were the worst affected while Saurashtra and Kutch remained largely peaceful.<ref name="Oommen-2005" /> 

Attacks by large mobs began in the districts of Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Saberkantha and, for the first time in its history, Gandhinagar on February 28. Violence spread to the largely rural districts of Panchmahals, Mehsana, Kheda, Junagadh, Banaskantha, Patan, Anand and Narmada the next day. Over the next two days, Bharuch and Rajkot and later Surat were hit.<ref name="Jaffrelot-2003"></ref>

The first incidents of attacks on the minority Muslim community started at Ahmedabad, where Hindus began throwing stones at and later burned a Muslim housing complex known as Gulburg Society, and then spread elsewhere.<ref name="Dugger 200">Dugger, Celia W. ''200 Are Dead In 3-Day Riot Of Revenge In West India New York Times''.  New York, N.Y.:2 March 2002.  p. A1</ref> The initial violence was believed to be instigated by unsubstantiated rumours, endorsed by a senior VHP leader, of Muslims having kidnapped three Hindu girls during the Godhra train attack.<ref name="Dugger 200"/> 

Hundreds of mosques and other Muslim shrines were damaged or destroyed and makeshift Hindu temples were installed in their place in some cases. In Ahmedabad, the dargah of the Sufi saint-poet Wali Gujarati in Shahibaug and the 16th century Gumte Masjid mosque in Isanpur were destroyed. The Muhafiz Khan Masjid at Gheekanta was ransacked.<ref>, </ref> Police records list 298 dargahs, 205 mosques, 17 temples and three churches as damaged in the months of March and April.<ref name="TOI-28-Apr-2002"></ref>

===Attacks on Muslims===

In Naroda, according to Human Rights Watch, at least 65 Muslims were killed, many of them women who were sexually assaulted by violent mobs[http://hrw.org/reports/2002/india/India0402-02.htm#P277_48731]. One of the witnesses alleged before the Nanavati commission that that BJP leader Maya Kodnani, Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi and others led mobs on February 28 in the Naroda-Patia area. <ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/html/uncomp/articleshow?msid=210404 Riot witness names MLA]</ref>

A high profile case involved an Ex-Congress MP Ehsan Jafri who was surrounded by Hindu Mobs (including Congress workers) while many other Muslim residents in the area took shelter in his compound. JAfri was believed to have contacted the local police stations, MPs of the area as well as the Chief Minister Modi to save the people from the ever increasing mob. However, no police reinforcement had reached his place and the few policemen present were  ineffective and unwilling to control the violent mob." Eventually he was burnt to death, along with fifty others.<ref>[http://nhrc.nic.in/guj_annex_1.htm National Human Rights Commission report]</ref>

According to HRW in its widely-quoted report, mobs of thousands, dressed in saffron scarves and khaki shorts - the signature uniform of the RSS - and armed with swords, sophisticated explosives, and gas cylinders, were guided by voter lists and printouts of addresses of Muslim-owned properties, information obtained from the local municipal administration.<ref name="Dawn1">[http://www.dawn.com/2002/04/30/top6.htm Police officials led Hindu attackers: HRW report on Muslims’ massacre in Gujarat], ''Dawn'', April 30, 2002</ref> Muslims in Ahmedabad alleged that there were elements of planning in the violence.<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/mar/12train1.htm Rediff.com]</ref>

===Attacks on Hindus===
Attacks on Hindus by Muslim mobs in Danilimda, Modasa, Himmatnagar, Bharuch, Sindhi Market, Bhanderi Pole, and other localities in the city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat were perpetrated by Muslim mobs.<ref name="HRW Hindu attacks">[http://hrw.org/reports/2002/india/India0402-04.htm Attacks on Hindus],''Human Rights Watch''</ref> There was a significant loss of life and property.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/articleshow?art_ID=4007683 Riots hit all classes, people of all faith]</ref><ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/full_story.php?content_id=2401 A home for long now just a death trap]</ref>
Late in March, more than one thousand Hindus in Dariyapur and Kalupur, including 550 dalits, fled their homes to stay in makeshift shelters after being attacked by Muslims mobs.<ref>[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=16851 With no relief, they turn to religious places for shelter],''Indian Express''</ref> 
According to the HRW report, over ten thousand Hindus were made homeless.<ref name="HRW Hindu attacks"/> 

Several Hindu residential areas, including Mahajan No Vando, a fortified enclave in Muslim dominated Jamalpur, were targeted following calls for retaliation. 

<blockquote>In the morning the mosques began announcing that Islam was in danger, that there was poison in the milk. This is their code word. We are the only Hindus here, poison here means us. The rioting lasted between 2:15 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.<ref name="HRW Hindu attacks"/></blockquote>

Residents were unable go to work, fearing attacks. A Hindu temple in the area was destroyed. In Himmatnagar, a young man was killed when he went to a Muslim enclave on business.<ref name="HRW Hindu attacks"/>

==Toll==
According to an official estimate, 1044 people were killed in the violence - 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus including those killed in the Godhra train fire. Another 223 people were reported missing, 2,548 injured, 919 women widowed and 606 children orphaned.<ref>These figures were reported to the Rajya Sabha by the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Sriprakash Jaiswal in May, 2005.   </ref>

Unofficial estimates put the death toll closer to 2000, with Muslims forming a high proportion of those killed.<ref>, , Brass (2005) pp. 388, </ref>

==Economic boycott of Muslims==

The People's Union for Civil Liberties allege that pamphlets were circulated by the Sangh Parivar to incite violence against and call for an economic boycott of the Muslim community.<ref>[http://www.pucl.org/Topics/Religion-communalism/2002/gujarat-nhrc-submission.htm#Details An Interim Report to the National Human Rights commission] People's Union for Civil Liberties</ref>

Shortly after the riots, when most Muslims were still in relief camps, a leaflet campaign "urging Hindus to boycott Muslim-owned shops and other establishments" was widely reported.<ref name="Dawn2"> "[http://www.dawn.com/2002/03/22/int2.htm Drive for boycott of Gujarat Muslims]", ''Dawn, March 22, 2002</ref><ref name="WP1">"Sectarian Violence Haunts Indian City; Hindu Militants Bar Muslims From Work", by Rama Lakshmi, ''Washington Post'', April 8, 2002</ref> The leaflets urged the Hindu reader not to frequent Muslim-owned restaurants, work in Muslim-run offices, hire Muslims or see films starring Muslim actors; they further assured the reader that the boycott would "throttle these elements. It will break their backbone. Then it will be difficult for them to live in any corner of this country."<ref name="Dawn2"/> The economic boycott and "pressure from Hindu radicals" caused fewer employers to re-hire returning Muslims.<ref name="WP1"/> No group claimed direct responsibility for the leaflets but a senior official of Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) was quoted as saying he was "in complete agreement with whatever is propagated through them."<ref name="Dawn2"/>

As a consequence of the leaflet campaign, observers claimed that year<ref>[http://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/india0703/Gujarat-09.htm TITLE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and even two and half years later<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/html/uncomp/articleshow?msid=877252 Muslims still face economic boycott in Pavagadh-Ahmedabad-Cities-The Times of India<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, the economic boycott of Muslims was severe in Pavagadh district. As a consequence of the boycott and continued threats, relief organisations lamented that they were having to build "ghettoes" for the displaced.<ref>[http://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/india0703/Gujarat-09.htm X.

New York Times' Celia Dugger reported that witnesses were "dismayed by the lack of intervention from local police", who often "watched the events taking place and took no action against the attacks on Muslims and their property".<ref name="Dugger 60">Dugger, Celia W. ''Hindu Rioters Kill 60 Muslims in India New York Times''.  New York, N.Y.:1 March 2002.</ref> 

Human Rights Watch reported that in some cases members of the state police force led rioting mobs, "aiming and firing at every Muslim who got in the way", or instead of offering assistance "led the victims directly into the hands of their killers."<ref name="Dawn1"/> Calls for assistance to the police, fire brigades, and even ambulance services generally proved futile.<ref name="Dawn1"/> 

By the end of April, police recorded 170 people as killed in police firing, of whom 93 were  Muslims and 77 were Hindus.<ref name="TOI-28-Apr-2002" />
   
Hindu residents of Mahajan No Vando, part of the Muslim dominated area of Jamalpur, told HRW that on March 1, the police ignored phone calls and left them fend for themselves when a Muslim mob attacked.<ref name="HRW Hindu attacks"/> Numerous calls by Hindus throughout the riots were reportedly ignored by the police.<ref name="HRW Hindu attacks"/>

RB Sreekumar, who served as Gujarat's intelligence chief during the riots, alleged that the state government issued "unconstitutional directives", with officials asking him to kill Muslims involved in rioting or disrupting a Hindu religious event. The Gujarat government denied the allegations, calling them "baseless" and instigated out of malice because Mr. Sreekumar was not promoted.<ref name="BBCUK">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4445107.stm BBC UK Website]</ref>

Defending the Modi administration in the Rajya Sabha against charges of genocide, BJP spokesman V K Malhotra said that the official toll of 254 Hindus, killed mostly in police firing, indicates how the state authorities took effective steps to curb the violence.<ref>[http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=46626 BJP cites govt statistics to defend Modi]</ref>  BJP MP and journalist Balbir Punj disputed allegations of bias against Muslims by the BJP-run state government, pointing out that the majority of those arrested during and after the riots were Hindus.<ref name="punj-mea">[http://mea.gov.in/opinion/2002/04/25o01.htm Truth in Gujarat] by Balbir Punj</ref>

The United States Department of State in its International Religious Freedom Report 2003 stated:

In 2003, A comment by G.T. Nanavati, who leads the official commission investigating the riots, that part of the evidence collected and reviewed till then did not indicate any serious lapse on the part of the government or police in Gujarat<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/may/18guj.htm No police lapse in Gujarat riots: Justice Nanavati]  Rediff - May 18 2003</ref><ref></ref> was criticised as inappropriate by aid and reconciliation activists and other jurists.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

In response to allegations of state involvement, Gujarat government spokesman, Bharat Pandya, told the BBC that the rioting was a spontaneous Hindu backlash fuelled by widespread anger against Muslims. He said "Hindus are frustrated over the role of Muslims in the on-going violence in Indian-administered Kashmir and other parts of India" <ref name="BBC-19-Mar-02" />

The US Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom, John Hanford, expressing concern over religious intolerance in Indian politics, said that while the rioters may have been aided by state and local officials, he did not believe that the BJP-led central government was involved in inciting the riots. <ref></ref>
