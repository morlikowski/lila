==Plot summary==

In the Victorian period, Mowgli is the five-year-old son of a wilderness guide who accompanies his father on a hunting trip in the jungles of their native British girl named Katherine Anne "Kitty" Brydon, whose father, Colonel Geoffrey Brydon, commissioned the hunt. When Shere Khan attacks the camp and kills Mowgli's father, the boy is lost in the confusion and is left to fend for himself. Bagheera finds them and leads Mowgli to the wolf pack. Mowgli is befriended by the animals of the jungle including Baloo the bear cub, and they develop an unspoken bond as the growing boy learns to survive.  While in the wild, he discovers vast treasure in the ruins of an overgrown and lost city, deep in the jungle.

Years later, after growing to adulthood, Mowgli once again encounters Kitty, who still lives in India with her father and her arrogant and deceitful suitor, Captain William Boone. Kitty and Mowgli recognize each other, and while his powers of speech are rusty, Kitty reintroduces Mowgli to civilization with the help of Dr. Julius Plumford. However, after spending most of his life in the jungle, Mowgli does not feel at home among other people. He falls in love with Kitty, but he concedes to his rival for her affections. 

Meanwhile, Captain Boone and his men hatch a plot to force Mowgli to lead them to the treasure.  They fail to capture Mowgli, instead working their way through the jungle on their own.  Mowgli follows to protect Kitty. Boone's men are killed one by one until only Boone, Kitty, and Mowgli are left.  

They finally reach the treasure where Boone starts to pocket all the gold he can find. Guarding the treasure, Kaa strikes again and kills Boone. Shere Khan confronts Mowgli and Kitty as they exit, and Mowgli and the tiger stare at each other a long time before Shere Khan is stared down and leaves in submission. - the fulfillment of a prophecy Mowgli had in a dream in the beginning of the story.  Mowgli is reunited with Kitty and the two kiss underneath a waterfall at the end of the film.
