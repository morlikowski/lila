:''This is about the first "Philadelphia Athletics" baseball team that played from 1860-1876. See Philadelphia Athletics (American Association) for the 1882-1891 AA Athletics and Oakland Athletics for the 1901-1954 American League Athletics.''

'''Athletic of Philadelphia''' (also known as the '''Philadelphia Athletics''') was a prominent professional baseball team that played in the second half of the 19th century. 

==Forming and Success (1860-1875)==
===Early History===
Philadelphia "had been a baseball town from the earliest days of the game", fielding amateur teams since at least the early 1830s. In 1860, Atlantic of Brooklyn for the baseball championship in 1866. A famous Harper's illustration shows the Athletic players in uniforms with the familiar blackletter "A" on front.

When newspapers developed stand-alone game scores and league standings, the club was termed ''Athletic'' (''Base Ball Club'' being dropped in any case). In prose the team was commonly called ''the Athletics'', plural, and later generations have usually called both club and team the "Philadelphia Athletics". ''Athletic of Philadelphia'' is a compromise that contemporary readers would understand as an abbreviation for something like ''Athletic Base Ball Club, of Philadelphia'' in distinction from clubs of the same name in other cities.

=== National Association ===
Athletic turned professional in the late 1860s and helped establish the first league, National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NA), which began play in 1871. It played home games at Jefferson Street Grounds until expulsion from the major leagues in 1876.

The Athletics were one of the most successful National Association teams, winning the first pennant with a record of 21 wins and 7 losses (.750), two games ahead of the Boston Red Stockings and Chicago White Stockings. Actually, the race was much closer: the primary official criterion then was neither games nor winning percentage, but wins, and the three clubs finished in the order given with 21, 20, and 19 victories. The final game of the season, played on October 30 in Brooklyn, saw Athletic defeat Chicago, 4-1, clinching the title. (Nate Berkenstock, a 40-year-old amateur who played right field for Philadelphia that day due to injuries, made his only big-league appearance in that game.) 

While Boston dominated the NA, winning the other four pennants, the Athletics and New York Mutuals also fielded teams every year, with Philadelphia winning a few more games overall but never challenging Boston.<ref>Except for the Mutuals in 1874, shorter-lived clubs finished second. Judged by winning percentage, a later criterion, Athletic in 1875 achieved the sixth best season in NA history behind only the five pennant winners. But the criterion was wins, an incentive for clubs to complete their series. In the five NA seasons Athletic ranked 6-4-6-6-3 in games played, 1-4-5-3-3 in wins. --And the club ranked terminally 7 in games played for 1876.</ref>

captain throughout the NA seasons, which gives him manager credit today. Other star players include Al Reach in the 1860s and Cap Anson who played from 1872 to 1875 (Anson took over as captain near the very end of the 1875 season).

During their five-year existence the Athletics won 165 games and lost only 86 for a manager Dick McBride.

ここでは、ナショナル・アソシエーションとメジャーリーグのナショナルリーグに所属していた'''フィラデルフィア・アスレチックス'''（'''Philadelphia Athletics'''）について記述する。

==球団史==
ナショナル・アソシエーション」が発足すると、アスレチックスもプロの球団として加盟し、リーグ初年度に強豪だったボストンやシカゴを押さえてリーグ優勝を果たす。2年目以降も高い勝率を誇り、ナショナル・アソシエーション5年間の通算勝率は.657にもなる。

ナショナル・アソシエーションが解散した後、アスレチックスは1876年からナショナルリーグに加盟する。しかしチームは前年までの主力選手だったアンソンやマクブライドがシカゴやボストンに移籍してしまった後で、チームは2割台の勝率しか残せなかった。そのうちチームの財政が苦しくなり、遠征費が出せなくなったアスレチックスはシーズン終盤のゲームを消化することを拒否、同じ理由で試合が消化できなかったニューヨーク・ミューチュアルズともども、ナショナルリーグから除名されチームは消滅した。
