'''Mütiilation''' is a french one-man Black Legions. Since parting from the The Black Legions in 1996, Meyhna'ch has continued to create music under the band's name.

==History==
===The Beginning and The Black Legions===
'''Mütiilation''' was formed in Meyhna'ch, Dark Wizzard of Silence and a bassist by the name of David. They recorded some amounts of demos as a trio until 1994, when David left. This was due to Mütiilation joining The Black Legions and his choice to not follow their views. At this time Mütiilation released an EP to honor the circle titled ''Hail Satanas We Are The Black Legions''. 

Shortly after Dark Wizzard of Silence was replaced by Krissagrazabeth, who participated in the recordings up until ''Vampires of Black Imperial Blood''. Once again it was due to disagreeing views. At his departure, Mørdrëd joined in to be the first Mütiilation bassist to be part of The Black Legions. This line-up would be featured in The Black Plague - First Chapter (And Maybe Last One).

===The Reincarnation===
In 1999 a compilation entitled ''Remains of a Ruined, Dead, Cursed Soul'' was released through Drakkar Productions to give fans some of the unreleased material. The album stated that Meyhna'ch was dead due to the trendy black metal scene. However in 2001, Mütiilation came back with the release of ''Black Millenium<!--PLEASE NOTE that "Millenium" is the correct spelling here.--> (Grimly Reborn)'', stating that he was not buried yet. At this point the band had become a solo project, and Meyhna'ch still used the symbols from The Black Legions on some of the releases.

Mütiilation then followed with short tours with acts such as Impiety, Abigail, Judas Iscariot. During this time Noktu, Fureiss and Astrelya from Celestia were used as live members, filling in for double guitars, and drums. 

Since then, Mütiilation has released three more full lengths as well as a compilation best of, and re-released some older albums.
