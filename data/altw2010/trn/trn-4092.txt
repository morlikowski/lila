thumb|Various [[List of symbols#Religious, esoteric, metaphysical and mystical symbols|religious symbols]] '''Religious studies''', or '''Religious education''', is the academic field of multi-disciplinary, religious beliefs, behaviors, and institutions. It describes, compares, interprets, and explains religion, emphasizing systematic, historically-based, and cross-cultural perspectives.

While anthropology, sociology, psychology, philosophy, and history of religion. 

Religious studies originated in late 19th century in Europe, when scholarly and historical analysis of the Bible had flourished, and Hindu and Cornelius P. Tiele, in the Netherlands. Today religious studies is practiced by scholars worldwide. 
'''
In its early years, it was known as Comparative Religion or the '''Science of Religion''' and, in the USA, there are those who today also know the field as the History of Religion (associated with methodological traditions traced to the University of Chicago in general, and in particular Mircea Eliade, from the late 1950s through to the late 1980s). The field is known as ''Religionswissenschaft'' in Germany and ''Sciences de la religion'' in the French-speaking world.

==Religious studies vs. theology==
Western philosophy of religion, as the basic ancestor of modern religious studies, is differentiated from theology and the many Eastern philosophical traditions by generally being written from a third party perspective. The scholar need not be a believer. Theology stands in contrast to the philosophy of religion and religious studies in that, generally, the scholar is first and foremost a believer employing both logic ''and'' scripture as evidence. At least one theologian  has noted that one can study and analyze a symphony to understand it in great detail, but it is the listening that is of greatest significance.

==Intellectual foundation and background==	 
Before religious studies became a field in its own right (e.g., flourishing in the US as of the late-1960s), several key intellectual figures explored religion from a variety of perspectives. One of these figures was the famous pragmatist William James. His 1902 Gifford lectures and book ''The Varieties of Religious Experience'' examined religion from a psychological-philosophical perspective and is still influential today. His essay ''The Will to Believe'' defends the rationality of faith.	 

Max Weber studied religion from an economic perspective in ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' (1904-5), his most famous work. As a major figure in sociology, he has no doubt influenced later sociologists of religion.	 
Protestant and Catholic attitudes and doctrines regarding suicide in his work ''Suicide''. In 1912 he published his most memorable work on religion, ''Elementary Forms of the Religious Life''.

==History of religious studies==	 
thumb|right|Max MüllerInterest in the general study of religion dates back to at least BCE &ndash; ca. 476 BCE) and Persian, Jewish, Christian, and Indian belief and practice. The first history of religion was the ''Treatise on the Religious and Philosophical Sects'' (1127 CE), written by the Muslim scholar Muhammad al-Shahrastani. Peter the Venerable, also working in the twelfth century, studied Islam and made possible a Latin translation of the Qur'an.	 
Notwithstanding the long interest in the study of religion, the academic discipline Religious Studies is relatively new. Dr. Chris Partridge notes that the "first professorships were established as recently as the final quarter of the nineteenth century."[http://www.uccf.org.uk/yourcourse/rtsf/docs/academicstudyofreligion.pdf]	 
In the nineteenth century, the study of religion was done through the eyes of science. Max Müller was the first Professor of Comparative Religion at Oxford University, a chair created especially for him. In his ''Introduction to the Science of Religion'' (1873) he wrote that it is "the duty of those who have devoted their life to the study of the principal religions of the world in their original documents, and who value and reverence it in whatever form it may present itself, to take possession of this new territory in the name of true science."	 

Partridge writes that "by the second half of the twentieth century the study of religion had emerged as a prominent and important field of academic enquiry." He cites the growing distrust of the empiricism of the nineteenth century and the growing interest in non-Christian religions and spirituality coupled with convergence of the work of social scientists and that of scholars of religion as factors involved in the rise of Religious Studies.	 

In the 1960s and 1970s, the term "religious studies" became common and interest in the field increased. New departments were founded and influential journals of religious studies were initiated (for example, ''Religious Studies and Religion''). In the forward to ''Approaches to the Study of Religion'', Ninian Smart wrote that "in the English-speaking world [religious studies] basically dates from the 1960s, although before then there were such fields as 'the comparative study of religion', the 'history of religion', the 'sociology of religion' and so on..."

In the 1980s, in both Britain and America, "the decrease in student applications and diminishing resources in the 1980s led to cut backs affecting religious studies departments." (Partridge) Later in the decade, religious studies began to pick up as a result of integrating religious studies with other disciplines and forming programs of study that mixed the discipline with more utilitarian study.

Philosophy of religion uses philosophical tools to evaluate religious claims and doctrines.  Western philosophy has traditionally been employed by English speaking scholars.  (Some other cultures have their own philosophical traditions including Indian, Muslim, and Jewish.)  Common issues considered by the (Western) philosophy of religion are the existence of cosmology, and logical inferences of logical consistency from sacred texts.

Although philosophy has long been used in evaluation of religious claims (''i.e.'' Augustine and Pelagius's debate concerning original sin), the rise of scholasticism in the 11th century, which represented "the search for order in intellectual life" (Russell, 170), more fully integrated the Western philosophical tradition (with the introduction of translations of Aristotle) in religious study.

There is some amount of overlap between subcategories of religious studies and the discipline itself.  Religious studies seeks to study religious phenomena as a whole, rather than be limited to the approaches of its subcategories.

===Origin of religion===

The "origin of religion" refers to the emergence of religious behavior in prehistory, before written records.

===History of religion===
The history of religions is not concerned with theological claims apart from their historical significance.  Some topics of this discipline are the historicity of religious figures, events, and the evolution of doctrinal matters.

===Sociology of religion===
Sociology of religion is concerned with the social aspects of religion, both in theory and in practice.  Social structure, the relationship between individual practitioner and religious community, and the construction of meaning are a few of the concerns of the sociologist of religions.  Emile Durkheim was the forefather of the sociological study of religion. In 1912 he stated in ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life'' that religion cannot be separated from society, and vice-versa. Durkheim saw religion as a form of social solidarity which helped members of the society to bond together and worship the natural or the supernatural. Simply put, for the sociologist of religions the social conditions in the local form of Heaven or Pantheon mirror the local social conditions on earth, also often the former act to justify the latter.<ref>Gustav Mensching (Rudolf Otto's primary pupil in Germany), 1968. ''Soziologie der Religion'' ("Sociology of religion"), Germany: Bonn, p. 60ff (in German).</ref>

===Psychology of religion===
The psychology of religion is concerned with what psychological principles are operative in religious communities and practitioners.  William James was one of the first academics to bridge the gap between the emerging science of psychology and the study of religion.  A few issues of concern to the psychologist of religions are the psychological nature of religious conversion, the making of religious decisions, and the psychological factors in evaluating religious claims.

===Anthropology of religion===
The anthropology of religion is principally concerned with the common basic needs of man that religion fulfills.

===Cultural anthropology of religion===

The cultural anthropology of religion is principally concerned with the cultural aspects of religion. Of primary concern to the cultural anthropologist of religions are rituals, beliefs, religious art, and practices of piety.

===Literary approaches===
There are many approaches to the study of sacred texts.  One of these approaches is to interpret the text as a literary object.  Metaphor, thematic elements, and the nature and motivations of the characters are of interest in this approach. An example of this approach is ''God: A Biography'', by Jack Miles.

===Neurological approaches===
Recently there has been an interesting meeting between neurology and religion, especially Buddhism.  Also of interest has been the temporal lobe, the "God center" of the brain. (Ramachandran, ch. 9)  

Although not a widely accepted discipline within religious studies, neurological findings in regard to religious experience may very well become of more widespread interest to scholars of religion.  Scientific investigators have used a SPECT scanner to analyze the brain activity of both Christian contemplatives and Buddhist meditators, finding them to be quite similar.<ref>{{cite book

==Methodologies==
A number of methodologies are used in Religious Studies.  Methodologies are hermeneutics, or interpretive models, that provide a structure for the analysis of religious phenomena.

'''宗教学'''（英语Religious Studies或者Study of Religions，德语为Religionswissenschaft），一般指以研究各種宗教形成、发展、变化、成果、理论、著作的一门人文學和社会科学的交叉学科。宗教學與神學都以宗教為研究對象，其差異在於宗教學較由從宗教外部的各種角度來觀察分析宗教，並經常與其他相關學科如社會學、人類學、心理學、歷史學等結合。宗教學相較於神學是較新興的學科，例如在美國約在1950年代才出現宗教學相關科系。

==宗教学的历史==
===宗教学在欧洲===
在人类历史的各个阶段都有关于宗教信仰的研究，当时作为一个现代意义上的学科，宗教学起源于欧洲。最早出现当代意义上宗教学的国家包括英国、荷兰、德国和北欧诸国。
19世纪末，英国牛津大学设立了“比较宗教”（Comparative Religion）教席，马科斯·穆勒（Max Müller）被任命为首任教授。他在1873年所著的《宗教科学引论》（Introduction to the Science of Religion）通常被认为是宗教学的首部著作。
20世纪初，德国大学很多神学专业开始教授基督教之外的其他宗教、信仰的相关内容。在德国的大学系统内，1912年在莱比锡大学出现了第一个独立的宗教学专业。

===宗教学在美国===
===宗教学在汉语世界===

==宗教學分支==
===宗教史學===
'''宗教史學'''(History of Religions)始於19世紀末葉，研究宗教起源、發展及其性質的學科，與考古學、古語學等學科交叉，也可只研究某一特定宗教的歷史（如佛教史），或只研究某一因素的歷史（如宗教觀念史）。

===宗教人類學===
'''Anthropology of Religion)始於19世紀，研究處於無文字階段的原始民族中的宗教信仰及其各種因素、探索遠古時代的原始宗教。與宗教社會學不同的是，它較傾重於原始宗教。隨著西方殖民擴張和傳教活動發展，宗教學家在大洋洲、非洲等地的原始部落中進行實地考察，掌握了大量土著文化及其宗教資料加以整理，令宗教人類學得以迅速發展。宗教人類學著重傳統的田野調查、統計學及象徵體系的比較方法，與民俗學及民族學交叉。代表學說有萬物有靈論、前萬物有靈論、巫術論、原始一神論、功能論及神話結構學說等。

===宗教文化學===

===宗教現象學===
宗教現象學(Phenomenology of religion)為現象學運動的一部分，而其本質和研究目的仍在宗教學者間存在爭議。宗教現象學可概括分為描述性、分門別類式、探求本质，意义和结构為目的之研究。而宗教現象學的方法一直被視為藝術。
