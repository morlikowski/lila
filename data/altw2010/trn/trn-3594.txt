'''Martin Andresen''' (born Norwegian football midfielder.

==Club Career==
Martin Andresen was a regular on many Norwegian national youth teams while playing for Wimbledon in a deal worth £1,8 million. But like many of the other Norwegians in the club, his stay became short and unsuccessful. After a short loan spell at Molde FK, Andresen returned to his motherclub Stabæk in 2001, where he proved himself to be one of the best central midfielders in Norway. 

After a brilliant 2003 season, where Stabæk captured the bronze medals in the Premiership club Adeccoliga, asked to be sold. Many clubs in Norway where interested in the newly appointed national team captain, but the high price scared many away, including the champions Rosenborg BK. Vålerenga looked set to capture Andresen just before Christmas 2004, but Brann, with help from local investors signed the midfielder on December 23 2004.

===Brann===
Martin Andresen became the most expensive transfer in Brann, clearly showing his importance for the club on and off the field. In 2006, Brann had their best season opening ever, much thanks to Andresen directing his teammates from his central midfielder position. He has in recent games been captain of the Norwegian national team, playing in central midfield. In 2007 Brann won the Norwegian League, with Andresen as captain. He was described as the most valuable player by many Norwegian pundits. He was also named in the Team of the Year.

===Vålerenga===
Andresen was announced as the new head coach of Vålerenga on November 6 2007 while still under contract with Brann for the remainder of the year. Brann terminated their working relationship with Andresen the day after. He signed a three year long contract with Vålerenga, and thus became the first player/head coach in the Norwegian Premier League since Kjetil Rekdal in 2002.

==International career==
He made his debut for Norway in an August 2001 friendly match against Turkey and earned 36 caps since, scoring 3 goals.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/noo-recintlp.html Norway - Record International Players] - RSSSF</ref>

==Private life==
