'''Strathfield Municipal Council''' is a Local Government Area of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The Council was formed in 1885 and originally included the suburbs of Redmire, Homebush and Druitt Town.  The name Strathfield was adopted by the new Council in 1885.  The suburb of Redmire was renamed Strathfield at this time. Druitt Town was renamed Strathfield South in the early 1890s. Only Homebush survives as an original location name.

A disastrous attempt in the 1790s by the first settlers to farm the land, resulted in the land being abandoned.  However, by the 1870s, the district commenced development primarily as a residential area.  The central location, halfway between Sydney and Parramatta, the establishment of rail services (from 1855 at Homebush) and availability of land, initially at low costs, attracted many wealthy merchants to build country style mansions within reasonable access to their City based businesses.  Strathfield was also promoted as a healthy environment, away from owercrowded City conditions and diseases.  Early land advertisements speak of the inland location as away from the 'injurious sea conditions'.  With the relocation to Strathfield of many prominent families including the heirs of retailer David Jones, chemist Washington H Soul and many others, Strathfield became an elite and wealthy area.  It's devleopment differed markedly from the more working class areas of surrounding districts like Canterbury, Auburn and Concord.  

The Strathfield Municipality has expanded over time and now includes the suburbs of Strathfield, Homebush, Homebush West, Flemington, Greenacre, Enfield, Strathfield South, Chullora (part) and Belfield (part). Over the years it has become a major Chinese, and Sri Lankan. Strathfield Municipal Council has a population of about 32,000 people and is one of Sydney's medium sized Councils. 

Strathfield Municipal Council has traditionally opposed forced amalgamations with other local government areas, though the current Council itself has been expanded in size and population by incorporating the abolished Homebush Council in 1947 and the West Ward of the former Enfield Council in 1949. 

Strathfield Council was rocked in 2004-05 by allegations of corruption involving rezoning of land use. The two councillors involved resigned following the inquiry by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC).

==History==

Strathfield Municipal Council was proclaimed on June 2, 1885 by the Governor of NSW, Sir Augustus Loftus, after residents of the Redmire area petitioned the New South Wales State government to form local government.  This move was opposed by residents of Homebush and Druitt Town, possibly fearing the dominance of the more affluent and politically connected residents of Redmire.  Despite counter petitions, the Municipality was incorporated in 1885.  

The Council built the current Council Chambers in 1887, between 1885 and 1887 the Council operated from various private homes in Strathfield, pending the building of a permanent Council Chambers. The Strathfield Town was built in 1923. The council annexed the Flemington district in 1892 and in doing so substantially increased the number of residents living in the Municipality as development density was higher in the more working class Flemington than in Strathfield.

Several attempts at amalgamating the council have been made: the first happened with Enfield was added in 1949. In 1974 two reports, one by J.C. Barnett and the other from the Ashfield, Drummoyne, Burwood and Concord should amalgamate with Strathfield. This was energetically opposed by residents and council alderman and this amalgamation also did not come to fruition. In 1992, a section of the northern part of the Municipality was transferred to the Auburn Council area. In return, the area of and between Boundary Creek and the railway line, occupied by the former Ford factory building, was transferred from Auburn to Strathfield Council.

In the 90s Strathfield saw a large influx of Campsie &mdash; which also had experienced an influx of Koreans into the area and a boom in numbers of International Students &mdash; but also because of Strathfield Korean Uniting Church on Homebush Road. There are now numerous Korean restaurants and shops in the area. It is the biggest Korea Town in the Southern hemisphere.

The Municipality has two libraries; the Central Library in Homebush and a Branch library in Strathfield South. The central library, located in Homebush, was demolished in 2002 and a new library was built and opened in 2004. 

A key element of Strathfield is its role as a location for many educational institutions including the Mount St Mary's Campus of Meriden, Trinity Grammar Preparatory School and Strathfield South High School.

From St. Patricks's College, for example have come former State Opposition Leader Bob Simpson also reside in Strathfield.

Whilst not perhaps basking in quite the same popular musical glory as neighbouring Burwood with its links to the formation of the pop.  Strathfield was home during part of the 1960s to The BeeGees (Redmyre Road) and several Australian indie rock and indie pop bands have emerged from Strathfield including Prince Vlad & the Gargoyle Impalers, Lunatic Fringe, The Upbeat, Women of Troy member Paul O'Reilly and The Mexican Spitfires.  Grant McLennan of The Go-Betweens also lived in Carrington Ave., Strathfield for a number of years in the 1990s.  Although no members of the band were Stathfield residents the address in Woodward Ave, Strathfield of one of Radio Birdman's earliest fan club members inspired the lyrics of their mid-1970s pop song "Murder City Nights":

:Cruising down Woodward gotta find me some action
:Looking for a lover with a power reaction.

pop songs about a cemetery.  Written by Stephen McCowage the song featured the chorus:
