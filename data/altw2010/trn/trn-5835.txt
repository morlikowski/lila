right|thumb|300px|'''''am730''''' : Hong Kong's third free newspaper: copy dated [[October 12, 2005]]

'''''am730''''', operated by AM730 Media Limited, is the third free Chinese newspaper in Hong Kong, the prior two being ''Headline Daily'' and ''Metropolis Daily''. Shih Wing-ching, chairman of the ''Centaline Holdings'' property agency, is the founder of the newspaper. Shih introduced the new paper due to the unprecedented success of ''Metropolis Daily'', the pioneer in this market. ''Metropolis Daily'' was founded in 2002, and was so successful that it broke even in only fourteen months.  Realising the profitability of the market, Shih established ''am730'' in late July.

Shih believes free newspapers have become a worldwide trend that will gain more and more market share. He agrees that free newspapers will in the near future become the way people are informed about daily events around the world, as a free newspaper avoids the conflict of interest which exists between the for-pay newspapers and their readers. As the primary income of a free newspaper is the advertisements and the income of those who advertise comes from the readers, this suggests that a newspaper's mostly valuable asset should be its readers; thus, readers should not be charged for the news.

== Overview ==
'''am730''' launched its first circulation volume is around three hundred thousand copies daily. 

The name of the newspaper is intended to suggest a fresh approach towards the methodology of naming newspapers. It does not incorporate the term "daily" because this word reflects the conventional way of naming a news journal. The name literally states the newspaper's aim to distribute the publication during rush hour, which is approximately 7:30am.

According to Shih, the newspaper is tailored to young people. 7:30am is about when the sun rises; it signals vitality, just like the young people who are at the start of a long journey through life. It is a new vision aimed to change the old quality of Hong Kong newspapers. In its first week, ''am730'' sold one hundred thousand copies. Eventually, it aims to increase circulation to three hundred thousand copies, which is similar to the other two free newspapers (''Metropolis Daily'': 300,000; ''Headline Daily'': 400,000)

==Language and style==
''am730'' tends to adopt internet slang and other expressions which are widely used on the Internet and popular among youth. The newspaper official says it is advisable to use internet slang and does not think that colloquial expressions in newspaper articles will affect young people's language proficiency. What is more crucial is using popular language to convey messages.  ''am730'' intends to offer a fresh sensation in news to its readers; it aims to widen the horizon of its readers, both internationally and culturally, and to promote an optimistic outlook on life and hopes for the future.

While being consistent with market regulations, ''am730'' is a real newspaper which offers more attention to journalistic principles. Unlike numerous other newspapers, ''am730'' is against the idea of indecent news as the selling point. It wants to provide a newspaper with accurate, simple news reports targeted to youth who have just begun their careers. The fresh, youthful style of ''am730'' is designed to encourage more young people to read newspapers. Shih hopes that through this free newspaper, young people in Hong Kong will cultivate a greater interest in the news and in the future of Hong Kong.

''Headline Daily'', a newspaper which belongs to ''Sing Tao'', is the primary competition for ''am730''. Shih admits that ''Headline Daily'' has more resources than the privately investigated ''am730'' because of its attachment to ''Sing Tao Daily'', but that dependence on Sing Tao would harm the independence of its organization.

== Contents ==
In many ways, ''am730'' is similar to a traditional newspaper. Like most newspapers, the contents of the paper include local, western view in that they will only report bad things, as if there is no hope in this world, yet hope is what young people mostly need." The design and layout of the paper are colourful and appealing.

The detailed layout of the newspaper is as follows:

*'''Front page'''
The lead story of the day occupies almost the entire page of the paper, filled in with colourful illustrations. The other stories vary from local top stories to China and international news. 

Similar to a traditional newspaper, on the left corner is a column which briefly highlights the news of secondary importance that is available inside the paper. The highlights vary, including local, China, international, entertainment and sport news. At the bottom of the column is a display of the Mark Six results.

Typically, around three to four pages are allocated to the local news section. More important news such as politics and policies are reported in greater length than city news such as accidents and events.
