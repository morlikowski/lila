'''Thomas Anstis''' (d. 1723) was an early 18th century pirate, who served under Captain Howell Davis and then Captain Bartholomew Roberts, before setting up on his own account, raiding shipping on the eastern coast of the American colonies and in the Caribbean during what is often referred to as the "Golden Age of Piracy". 

==Early career== 
Anstis is first recorded as a member of the sloop ''Buck'', which sailed from A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates, p. </ref> 

==Roberts & Fenn & Admiral Flowers==
In May 1721, Roberts' ships headed for Africa, but Anstis and his crew in the ''Good Fortune'' slipped away in the night and continued to operate in the Caribbean.  Between Hispaniola and Jamaica, the ''Good Fortune'' plundered two vessels.  Aboard one, the ''Irwin'', Anstis's crew committed gang rape and murder against a female passenger.  Afterwards they stopped to careen their vessel.

Continuing onward towards HMS ''Morning Star''. After its capture, the ship was outfitted with 32 guns and placed in the command of ships gunner John Fenn, Anstis opting to retain command of the smaller ''Good Fortune'' because of her superior handling. The two ships continued to sail along the southeastern coast of the colonies until fighting began to break out among many of the forced crew members, and they decided to petition George I of Great Britain for a pardon, claiming they had been forced into piracy by Anstis and Roberts. 

Sailing to an island off HMS ''Hector'' and HMS ''Adventure''. Anstis was forced to cut his anchor cable and run, finally making his escape under oars when the fresh wind subsided. Anstis lost more than forty of his men on Grand Cayman, most of these being captured by a landing party from the two Royal Navy vessels, under the command of Flowers.

Anstis and Fenn (who had been rescued from Grand Cayman before the interference of the Royal Navy) now sailed to the Bay of Honduras and careened on an offshore island, capturing three or four prizes en route and augmenting their depleted crew from their captives.  Anstis next sailed for the Bahama Islands in early December, 1722. On the way, he captured a sloop named ''Antelope'', which he added to his squadron, and then a 24-gun ship, which was entrusted to Fenn.

==Final days==
The pirates put in at HMS ''Winchelsey''.  Antis and his men were forced to burn the ship and the sloop and flee into the island's interior, but the ''Winchelsey'''s marines overtook and captured them.  Anstis escaped again in his swift brigantine ''Good Fortune'', but his crew, discouraged by their losses, murdered him as he slept in his hammock, and took prisoner all who remained loyal. The mutineers then surrendered to Dutch authorities in Curaçao, where they received amnesty and their prisoners were hanged.

'''Thomas Anstis''' est un pirate du XVIIIème siècle. Il commence sa carrière de pirate en 1717 et sert sous les ordres du Capitaine Caraïbes.

Thomas Anstis apparaît pour la première fois dans le livre de bord d'un sloop : le ''Buck'', parti du port de Providence (Rhode Island) en 1718. Durant ce voyage, Anstis se mutine avec 6 autres marins, révélant ainsi leur intention de devenir pirates. Howell Davis est élu capitaine. A sa mort, Bartholomew Roberts devient à son tour capitaine et donne à Anstis le commandement d'une brigantine : le ''Good Fortune''.

En mai 1721, Bartholomew Roberts met le cap sur l'Afrique, mais Antsis profite de la nuit pour lui fausser compagnie et emmène le ''Good Fortune'' vers les Caraïbes. Entre Hispaniola et la Jamaïque, il capture et pille deux navires. Sur l'un deux, l'''Irwin'', l'équipage d'Anstis aurait violé puis tué une femme. Ce serait aussi à partir de ce moment qu'ils décident de ne plus caréner leur navire.

Anstis met ensuite le cap sur les Roberts et Anstis à se joindre à l'équipage.

Continuant de naviguer au large de Amiral Sir John Flowers à leur poursuite. Ils se dirigent alors vers l'île de Amiral Flowers. Anstis est contraint de couper le câble de son ancre et et de s'enfuir. Il parvient à échapper à ses poursuivant grâce à un vent qui lui est favorable. Il a tout de même perdu plus de 40 hommes, la plupart ayant été capturés sur le sol de l'île de Amiral Flowers.
