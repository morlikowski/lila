Το '''''συγκρότημα εκτοξεύσεων''''' πυραύλων με τον αριθμό '''''LC-34''''' στο ακρωτήριο Κανάβεραλ είναι διαστημική βάση της Πολεμικής Αεροπορίας στην  περιοχή του νησιού Merritt στην Φλόριντα. 

==Ιστορικό==
Η ανέγερση του συγκροτήματος ξεκίνησε τον Ιούνιο του LC-37 και προορίστηκε για το διαστημικό πρόγραμμα Απόλλων και συγκεκριμένα για τους πυραύλους Κρόνος Ι  και Κρόνος 1B.

Μεταξύ LC-39.

Στις Edward White και Roger Chaffee. 
Εις ανάμνησή τους η βάση αυτή από τον Απρίλιο 1984 ονομάζεται ''ιστορικό ορόσημο'' (αγγλ. ''Historic Landmark'').

'''Apollo Program, to launch Saturn I and IB rockets.

Notably, it was the site of the Apollo 204 (Apollo 1) fire, which claimed the lives of Ed White, and Roger Chaffee, on January 27, 1967.

==History==
===Construction===
Work began on LC-34 in 1960, and it was formally dedicated on June 5, 1961. The complex consisted of a launch platform, umbilical tower, mobile service tower, fueling facilities, and a blockhouse. Two steel flame deflectors were mounted on rails to allow placement beneath the launch platform. The service tower was likewise mounted on rails, and it was towed to a position 185 meters west of the pad before launch. At 95 meters high, it was the tallest structure at LC-34.

The blockhouse, located 320 meters from the pad, was modeled after the domed reinforced concrete structure at LC-20. During a launch, it could accommodate 130 people as well test and instrumentation equipment. Periscopes afforded views outside of the windowless facility.

===Saturn I series===
LC-34 saw its first launch on Saturn I, Block I, mission SA-1, lofted a dummy upper stage on a suborbital trajectory into the Atlantic. The subsequent three Saturn I launches took place at LC-34, ending with SA-4 on LC-37.

===Saturn IB series===
LC-34 was extensively modified to support Saturn IB launches, which began in February 1966. New anchor points were built to fasten the service structure in place during high winds. Access arms on the umbilical tower were rebuilt to match the larger rocket. At the 67-meter level, the swing arm was outfitted with a white room to permit access to the command module at the top of a rocket.

Two Saturn IBs (fire brought Apollo activities at the spaceport to an abrupt halt. After the fire, extinguishing equipment were installed at the top of the umbilical tower, and a slide wire was set up to provide astronauts a quick escape in the event of an emergency.

The first manned Apollo launch—Apollo 7 on LC-37 for the LC-39B was modified to launch Saturn IBs.
