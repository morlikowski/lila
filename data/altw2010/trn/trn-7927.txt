'''Emmerich Danzer''' (born European and World Champion.

==Career==
Emmerich Danzer began to skate at the age of five. He attended a Catholic school in Vienna. Herta Wächter was his coach from 1953.

Between 1965 and 1968 Danzer was European Champion four times and between 1966 and 1968 he was World Champion three times. He was famous for being strong in compulsory figures and in the free program. He also was very charismatic. However, he could not win a medal at the Olympics. He was the favorite for the Olympic Winter Games 1968, but at one compulsory figure he almost stopped and could not execute this figure well enough. He was correctly judged and ended up in 4th place. The best free program did not help. The audience disagreed with this decision heavily. But as opposed to many other skaters, he did not feel unfairly judged. The compulsory figures were simply a part of his sport.

In 1966 and in 1967 Emmerich Danzer was voted Austrian athlete of the year.

In 1968 he turned pro. Until 1975 he participated in shows of the Wiener Eisrevue (Vienna Ice Revue) and Holiday on Ice. Between 1975 and 1989 he worked as a coach in the United States.

Emmerich Danzer has been working for an insurance company in Vienna since 1989 and is in charge of sport insurance activities and sport sponsoring. Between 1995 and 1997 he was president of the Austrian figure skating organization (Österreichischer Eiskunstlaufverband). Since 2000 he has been president of the figure skating club "Wiener Eislaufverein".

Emmerich Danzer is also TV commentator for the Austrian television station ORF. For many years already he has been collaborating with Ingrid Wendl commentating figure skating events there.
