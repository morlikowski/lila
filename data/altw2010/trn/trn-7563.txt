'''Elkhart''' () is a city located about 100 miles due east of Elkhart County, Goshen, located about 10 miles south of Elkhart, is the county seat of Elkhart County.

==History==
thumb|left|250px|The St. Joseph River widens as it flows west through Elkhart.
At the beginning of the 19th Century, the area now known as Elkhart was mainly inhabited by the Ottawa, Chippewa, and Potawatomi Indian Tribes.  In 1829, the Village of Pulaski was established as  Post Office, mill and a few houses on the north side of the St. Joseph River.  Two years later, Dr. Havilah Beardsley moved westward from Ohio and purchased one square mile of land from Pierre Moran, a half French, half Native American Potawatomi Chief to establish a rival town named Elkhart.  In 1839, the Pulaski Post Office was officially changed to Elkhart.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.richarddeantaylor.com/htm/elkhart.htm<History of Elkhart>]</ref>

By the late 19th century and early 20th century, Musical Instrument factories, Miles Medical Company, and numerous mills set up shop and became the base of the economy.  In 1934, the first trailer factory opened up shop in Elkhart.  Similar companies followed suit for the remainder of the decade and growth continued to grow until the rationing of materials in World War II.  After the war, growth picked back up and by 1949, Elkhart was officially dubbed the "Trailer Capital of the World."<ref>[http://www.amishcountry.org/elkhart.county.rv.history]</ref>

===Infrastructure===
In 1851, Michigan Southern & Northern Indiana Railroad Company built the first rail line through the city and by 1952 the first passenger train passed through town.  This, in turn, caused major population growth.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.elkhartindiana.org/egov/docs/1167354894448.htm  City of Elkhart: Origins of Elkhart<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Today, Norfolk Southern has the biggest railroad presence in town.

In 1867, Elkhart Hydraulic Company built the first St. Joseph River and by 1870 it powered the city.<ref name="autogenerated3">[http://www.elkhartindiana.org/egov/docs/1167354162275.htm City of Elkhart: Origins of Elkhart<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Today, the dam still produces electric power and is operated by Indiana Michigan Power, a subsidiary of American Electric Power.

In 1889, the second electric streetcar system in the world began operation on the city's streets.<ref name="autogenerated1" />  It has since been decommissioned.

===Name===
There are several rumors to where the city's name came from.

The first says that the city was named after an Elkhart Indian Tribe, however there is no historical proof of such a tribe.  Another rumor, and the reason given on the city's website, says that the city's Island Park looks like an elk's heart.<ref>http://www.elkhartindiana.org/egov/docs/1167354162275.htm</ref>  However, it is unknown how Beardsley could have known what the Island looked like from above.  Cheif Tecumseh, and father of princess Mishawaka whom neighboring Mishawaka is named after. <ref>[http://www.stjoco.org/history/costly_victory.htm St. Joseph County, MI - County History: Costly Victory<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <ref>[http://www.richarddeantaylor.com/htm/elkhart.htm History of Elkhart<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1884, the Bucklen Opera House opened its doors for the first time with a seating capacity of 1200.  It was common for one performance to take place every week.  Elkhart's location on the railroad made it a good stopping point for shows traveling from New York to Chicago.  In 1896, the first movie was shown in the theater and it was also used as Elkhart High School's auditorium until 1924.<ref>[http://www.richarddeantaylor.com/htm/elkhart.htm<History of Elkhart]</ref>  The Bucklen was demolished in 1986.

The ELCO Performing Arts Center is a small theater located downtown.  After being built in 1924 and undergoing two name changes, it became the ELCO in 1934.  Ownership switched hands several times but the end of the ELCO appeared to be in sight when owner William Miller died in 1987.  In 1990, the city bought the theater to prevent further deterioration from vacancy.  Also that year, a commission was formed by some locals to oversee the restoration.  Funding issues led the city to get involved further in the form of getting a federal grant.  The grant helped with major upgrades and the hiring of a full time staff.<ref>[http://www.elcotheatre.com/history.html ELCO Performing Arts Center<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
