The song "Orgasmatron" was re-recorded in 2000 and was available as an Internet download under the name "Orgasmatron 2000". It was later included on the band's 2003 five-disc box-set ''Stone Deaf Forever!'' 

==Sleeve artwork==
As well as alluding to the original name of the album, Joe Petagno also commented on the concept behind the album cover:
<blockquote>[Lemmy] was living on a houseboat then, and collecting train models. He said, "You know, Joseph, I want a fucking train." It seemed weird to me... [laughs] but, yet again it worked.<ref name="AJP"/></blockquote>
The preliminary sketch had the Orgasmatron train going in the opposite direction, but Petagno "decided to turn it so it was going out of the picture rather than coming into it."<ref name="AJP"/>
<blockquote>It gave me a lot of trouble, because [of] trying to fit the head in front of the train with this cow scoop. But it worked in the end.<ref name="AJP"/></blockquote>
