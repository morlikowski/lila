'''Kimalaiset''' (''Bombus'') ovat mesipistiäisiä. Niillä on kömpelö, karvainen ruumis. Ne muodostavat yhdyskuntia niin kuin kesyt kiven alla. Se laskee toukkia, jotka elävät talven yli. Kimalaiset ovat tärkeimpiä lajia.

A '''bumblebee''' (or '''bumble bee''') is any member of the bee genus ''Bombus'', in the family Apidae; there are over 250 known species primarily occurring in the Northern Hemisphere.

Bumblebees are social insects that are characterized by black and yellow body hairs, often in bands. However, some species have orange or red on their bodies, or may be entirely black<ref></ref>. Another obvious (but not unique) characteristic is the soft nature of that hair (long, branched corbicula; a shiny concave surface that is bare, but surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport pollen (in similar bees, the hind leg is completely hairy, and pollen grains are wedged into the hairs for transport).

Like their relatives the honey bees, bumblebees feed on nectar and gather pollen to feed their young.

The blood or open circulatory system. The body organs, "heart" (dorsal aorta), muscles, etc. are surrounded  in a reservoir of blood. The dorsal aorta does pulse blood through its long tube, though, so there is a circulation of sorts.

In fertilised queens the ovaries are activated and when the queen lays her egg it passes along the oviduct to the vagina. In the vagina there is a container called the spermatheca. This is where the queen stored sperm from her mating. Before she lays the egg she will decide whether to use sperm from the spermatheca to fertilise it or not. Non-fertilised eggs grow into males, and only fertilised eggs grow into females and queens.

As in all animals hormones play a big role in the growth and development of the bumblebee. The hormones that stimulate the development of the ovaries are suppressed in the other female worker bees while the queen remains dominant. Salivary glands in the head secrete saliva which is mixed with the nectar and pollen. Saliva is also mixed into the nest materials to soften them. The fat body is a nutritional store; before hibernation queens eat as much as they can to enlarge their fat body, and the fat in the cells is used up during hibernation.

Like all bee tongues, the bumblebee tongue (the proboscis) is composed of many different mouthparts acting as a unit, specialised to suck up nectar via capillary action. At rest or when flying the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The abdomen is covered with dorsal tergites and ventral sternites. Wax is secreted from glands on the sternites.

The brightly-coloured stigma because it is better grounded than the other parts of the flower.

A bumblebee does not have ears, and it is not known whether or how a bumblebee could hear sound waves passing through the air, however they can feel the vibrations of sounds through wood and other materials.

===Habitat===
Bumblebees are typically found in higher B. alpinus'') range into very cold climates where other bees might not be found; ''B. polaris'' can be found in northern B. hyperboreus''.<ref>Milliron H.E., Oliver D.R. (1966) Bumblebees from northern Ellesmere Island, with observations on usurpation by ''Megabombus hyperboreus'' (Schönh.), Can. Entomol. 98:207–213</ref> One reason for this is that bumblebees can regulate their body temperature, via solar radiation, internal mechanisms of "shivering" and radiative cooling from the abdomen (called heterothermy). Other bees have similar physiology, but it has been best studied in bumblebees.<ref name=Heinrich>Heinrich, B. (1981) ''Insect Thermoregulation''</ref>

===Nests===
Bumblebees form queens who overwinter separately in protected spots. The queens can live up to one year, possibly longer in tropical species.

===Colony cycle===

Bumblebee nests are first constructed by over-wintered queens in the spring (in temperate areas). Upon emerging from hibernation, the queen collects pollen and nectar from flowers and searches for a suitable nest site. The characteristics of the nest site vary among bumble bee species, with some species preferring to nest in underground holes and others in tussock grass or directly on the ground. Once the queen has found a site, she prepares wax pots to store food and wax cells into which eggs are laid. These eggs then hatch into larvae, which cause the wax cells to expand isometrically into a clump of brood cells. 

These larvae need to be fed both nectar for carbohydrates and pollen for protein in order to develop. Bumblebees feed larvae nectar by chewing a small hole in the brood cell into which nectar is regurgitated. Larvae are fed pollen in two ways, depending on the bumblebee species. So called "pocket-maker" bumblebees create pockets of pollen at the base of the brood cell clump from which the larvae can feed themselves. Conversely, "pollen-storer" store pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larva in the same fashion as nectar.<ref name=Evans> Evans, Elaine et al. Befriending Bumble Bees. University of Minnesota Press. 2007. </ref> Bumble bees are incapable of trophallaxis.

With proper care, the larvae progress through four instars, becoming successively larger with each molt. At the end of the fourth instar the larvae spin a silk cocoon under the wax covering the brood cell, changing it into a pupal cell. The larvae then undergo an intense period of cellular growth and differentiation and become pupae. These pupae then develop into adult bees, who chew their way out of the silk cocoon. When adult bumble bees first emerge from their cocoons, the hairs on their body are not yet fully pigmented and are a greyish-white colour. The bees are referred to as "callow" during this time, and they will not leave the colony for at least 24 hours. The entire process from egg to adult bee can take as long as five weeks, depending on the species and the environmental conditions.

After the emergence of the first or second group of workers, workers take over the task of foraging and the queen spends most of her time laying eggs and caring for larvae. The colony grows progressively larger and at some point will begin to produce males and new queens. The point at which this occurs varies among species and is heavily dependent on resource availability and environmental factors. Unlike the workers of more advanced social insects, bumble bee workers are not physically reproductively sterile and are able to lay haploid eggs that develop into viable male bumble bees. Only fertilized queens can lay diploid eggs that mature into workers and new queens. 

Early in the colony cycle, the queen bumble bee compensates for potential reproductive competition from workers by suppressing their egg-laying by way of physical aggression and pheromonal signals.<ref name=Honk> Van Honk C.G.J., Velthuis H.H.W., Röseler P.-F.,Malotaux M.E. (1980) The mandibular glands of Bombus terrestris queens as a source of queen pheromones, Entomol. Exp. Appl. 28, 191–198. </ref> Thus, the queen will usually be the mother of all of the first males laid. Workers eventually begin to lay males later in the season when the queen's ability to suppress their reproduction diminishes.<ref name=Fletcher> Fletcher D.J.C., Ross K. (1985) Regulation of reproduction in eusocial Hymenoptera, Annu. Rev. Entomol. 30, 319–343.</ref> The reproductive competition between workers and the queen is one reason that bumble bees are considered "primitively eusocial".

New queens and males leave the colony after maturation. Males in particular are forcibly driven out by the workers. Away from the colony, the new queens and males live off nectar and pollen and spend the night on flowers or in holes. The queens are eventually mated (often more than once) and search a for suitable location for diapause.

===Foraging behavior===

Bumblebees generally visit flowers exhibiting the bee pollination syndrome. They can visit patches of flowers up to 1-2 kilometres from their colony.<ref name=Walther-Hellwig>Walther-Hellwig K, Frankl R (2000). Foraging distances of Bombus muscorum, Bombus lapidarius, and Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera, Apidae). Journal of Insect Behavior, 13, 239–246.</ref> Bumblebees will also tend to visit the same patches of flowers every day, as long as nectar and pollen continue to be available.<ref name=Dramstad>Dramstad WE, Fry GLA, Schaffer MJ (2003) Bumblebee foraging —is closer really better? Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 95, 349–357.</ref> While foraging, bumblebees can reach ground speeds of up to 15 m/s (54 km/h).<ref>A Landscape-Scale Study of Bumble Bee Foraging Range and Constancy, Using Harmonic Radar J.

When bumblebees arrive at a flower, they extract nectar using their long tongue ("crop. Many species of bumblebee also exhibit what is known as "nectar robbing": instead of inserting the mouthparts into the flower normally, these bees bite directly through the base of the corolla to extract nectar, avoiding pollen transfer.<ref name=Maloof>Maloof, J.E. 2001.
