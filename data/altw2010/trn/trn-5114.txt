The '''EM-2''', or "Janson rifle", was an experimental British assault rifle. It was designed to fire the experimental .280 British round that was being considered to replace the venerable .303 British, re-arming the British and allied forces with their first assault rifles and new machine guns. The EM-2 never entered production due to the United States refusing to standardize on the .280 because they claimed it was "lacking power". However, the Bullpup layout for a British service rifle was finally used some years later in the SA80 assault rifle.

==Background==

In the immediate post-.280 inch (7 mm) intermediate-power round, and set about developing a new rifle to fire it as well as considering a machine gun using the same round, the Taden gun. At the same time Fabrique Nationale expressed considerable interest in the round, and started development of their own rifles based on it. The Canadian Army also expressed interest in the new round, both to maintain commonality with the British, and to modernize their forces.

The Enfield started working on four designs of which two generally similar designs known as the EM-1 and the EM-2 (the "EM" standing for ''Enfield Model'') came to the fore. The nomenclature was made official on January 6 1948 <ref>Dugelby, Thomas B.. ''EM-2 Concept & Design; a rifle ahead of its time'', Collector Grade Publications, 1980, p. 27</ref>. Both were unofficially named after the lead designers in each team and were known as the ''Thorpe'' and the ''Janson'' respectively (Stefan Kenneth Janson was an assumed name of the Polish firearm designer Captain Kazimierz Januszewski).

Both were bullpup style weapons; the magazine and chamber are placed behind the trigger and pistol grip, leading to a shorter overall length (by about 20%) and a better ratio between barrel length and weapon length. Both used 20-round magazines with "stripper" reloads (as opposed to box magazines), included simple conical optical sights for fast aiming, and had a carrying handle built into the top. They could fire semi-automatic or fully automatic. The .280 round was accurate to about 800 yards (730 metres). The two designs were very similar looking, using the same sight but otherwise differing primarily in details. The EM-1 used steel plate pressings for simpler manufacture, though if anything was slightly heavier.

The EM-2 was eventually selected as the better design (though some say it was mostly due to it looking less space age), and was adopted as the British Army's new rifle on April 25 1951 as the ''Rifle, Automatic, Calibre .280, Number 9'' <ref>Dugelby, Thomas B.. ''EM-2 Concept & Design; a rifle ahead of its time'', Collector Grade Publications, 1980, p. 149</ref>, the designation by which it had been known in the War Office since the American weapons tests of 1950 .<ref>Dugelby, Thomas B.. ''EM-2 Concept & Design; a rifle ahead of its time'', Collector Grade Publications, 1980, p. 55</ref>

==NATO Standardisation==

It was at this point that the US put forth its own designs for Minister of Defence, Manny Shinwell who had already announced an intention to move to the .280. During this time, prototype EM-2s were rechambered to several different calibres, including a variety of experimental 7 mm cartridges, as well as the .30-06.

'''Ем-2'''-английская штурмовая винтовка, разработанная по схеме «Буллпап». Ем-2 так и не поступила на вооружение британской армии, поскольку США решили, что в НАТО стандарт патрона должен быть 7,62х51 мм. В послевоенной Англии это винтовка была известна под полным названием как "7-мм винтовка автоматическая, N9 Mk1", или Ем-2. Она была призвана заменить старую винтовку "Ли-Энфилд". Для стрельбы из Ем-2 применялся новый патрон 7х44.

== Система ==

Конструкция была построена по схеме «Буллпап», то есть магазин размещался за спусковым крючком. Работа механизмов была основана на принципе отвода пороховых газов с возможностью вести автоматическую стрельбу. Оптический прицел установлен в качестве стандартного. Между тем как только британская армия решила принять её на вооружение, американци заявили, что стандартным патроном НАТО будет 7,62х51. Винтовка Ем-2 не могла стрелять таким мощным патроном и её на вооружение не приняли.
