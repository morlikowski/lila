Il '''Boomerang''' è un caccia australiano operativo durante la seconda guerra mondiale. Progettato e prodotto in Australia dalla Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation a partire dal 1942, fu impiegato in azioni belliche dal 1943 al 1945.

== Storia e Sviluppo ==
Dopo il devastante attacco alla base di Pearl Harbour del dicembre 1941, l'avanzata giapponese nel Sud Pacifico fu fulminea e travolgente. Le scarse forze aeree alleate presenti nell'area, dotate per larga parte di velivoli obsoleti, subirono pesantissime perdite.

Con la conquista da parte giapponese delle Impero Giapponese. La '''Caccia (''Fighters''), dipendevano in tutto dall'industria del Europa e nel Mediterraneo, aveva la priorità di rifornire la RAF (''Royal Air Force'') britannica. Inoltre l'altro forte alleato, gli Stati Uniti, non aveva ancora portato a regime la propria produzione bellica. Sorgeva allora la necessità, da parte australiana, di risolvere in casa la grave crisi corrente.

Proprio nell'ottica di una "indipendenza" industriale dalla Gran Bretagna, nel 1936 era stata fondata la Port Melbourne; il progetto era proprio quello di garantire, in caso di guerra, i vitali rifornimenti di mezzi alla RAAF, qualora l'apporto di tali mezzi da parte della Gran Bretagna fosse venuto meno.

All'inizio del 1942, solo due velivoli erano in produzione in Australia: l'Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp da 1.200 hp i quali, pur non essendo indicati per l'utilizzo su un caccia, erano comunque gli unici motori con buone prestazioni disponibili in quelle circostanze. Il Wirraway, inoltre, fu utilizzato come punto di partenza per lo sviluppo del nuovo caccia.

Ad occuparsi della progettazione del velivolo, denominato '''CA-12''', fu il capo progettista della CAC, Heinkel, rifugiatosi in Australia dopo l'avvento del nazismo.

Il progetto fu impostato sulla manovrabilità, più che sulla velocità. La RAAF ordinò '''105 CA-12''' il 2 febbraio '''1942''', e il primo volo fu effettuato il cannoncini Hispano da 20mm, tutti alloggiati nelle corte ali, gli conferivano una straordinaria potenza di fuoco. Ma le prestazioni restavano comunque piuttosto basse, a causa soprattutto della bassa velocità, di appena 470 km/h; sopra i 15.000 ft (4.600 m), poi, tali prestazioni si abbassavano ulteriormente. Era, nel complesso, un caccia nettamente inferiore al suo principale avversario, il Mitsubishi A6M "Zero".

Già alla metà del 1942 si iniziarono a progettare dei miglioramenti al CA-12. La versione '''CA-14''' avrebbe dovuto montare un nuovo Curtiss-Wright R-2600 Cyclone da 1.700 hp, con l'intento di migliorare i deficit di velocità e rateo di salita. Ma il motore, ordinato dagli Stati Uniti in 1500 esemplari, non fu mai consegnato. Fu allora installato il R-2800 prodotto dalla CAC su licenza in Australia, a Lidcombe. Tuttavia, il peso eccessivo del nuovo apparato motore comportò notevoli problemi, e si ritornò a montare il Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp, con l'aggiunta di una turbina General Electric B-2 per aumentarne le prestazioni.

Questa nuova versione, apparsa nel luglio '''1943''' e denominata '''CA-14A''', comportava un aumento della velocità nell'ordine del 25-30%, e un aumento di 4.000ft (1.200m) della quota massima operativa, rispetto al CA-12.

The '''CAC Boomerang''' was a World War II fighter aircraft designed and manufactured in Australia between 1942 and 1945. The Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation gave Boomerangs the model numbers '''CA-12''', '''CA-13''', '''CA-14''' and '''CA-19'''.

==Development==
===Background===
The Pearl Harbor, Thailand, Malaya, and the Philippines. Within a few months, Japanese forces had conquered vast areas of the Pacific and South East Asia. During these campaigns, the ill-prepared Allied air forces in the Pacific suffered devastating losses.

Because of political and cultural ties between the United Kingdom and Australia, British manufacturers were the main source of RAAF aircraft. However, the British aircraft industry had long been hard pressed to meet the needs of the RAF. Although United States companies had enormous aircraft manufacturing capacity, they were only just starting to produce fighters in quantity, and it was uncertain when supplies would be made available to the RAAF. 

Only two military aircraft were in production in Australia at that time: the Lidcombe, Sydney. As this was the exact same engine that was used to power the US Navy's quite successful Grumman F4F Wildcat, this was a logical choice for the new fighter, apart from it being the only high-performance engine available at the time.

The Wirraway trainer provided a starting point for the Boomerang's airframe. CAC general manager (and former chief designer) Fishermans Bend, Aichi in Japan.<ref>Ross 1995, p. 316.  [http://mywebpage.netscape.com/smallscalesqdn/0603/0603.html#Section2d Gary Sunderland, "Elliptical Wings Part 2: The Fred David Story"] (''Small Scale Squadron Down Under'', v.6 no.3, September 2002).</ref> As a result, he had a comprehensive knowledge of advanced contemporary fighter designs, including the Heinkel He 112 and A6M Zero.

The RAAF ordered 105 '''CA-12''' (Mark I) Boomerangs  on 2 February 1942, before the prototype first flew on 29 May 1942. 

The Boomerang was a small fighter, designed with an emphasis on manoeuvrability. It had an overall length of just 7.7 metres (25.5 ft) and an 11 m (36 ft) wingspan. Although the original intention had been to use as many Wirraway components as possible, the final design was quite different, with shorter wings, a shorter, wood-sheathed, aluminium-framed fuselage, increased strength for combat stresses and a new centre section.  

Test flights found that the CA-12 handled well. It was very well-armed, with two 20 mm cannon and four .303 calibre (7.7 mm) machine guns, all mounted in the short, thick wings. The Boomerang was also generously equipped with armour plating to protect the pilot. However, general performance was mediocre. Although lively at low level, performance fell away rapidly over 15,000 ft (4,600 m), and at the maximum speed of 265 knots (490 km/h) was not sufficient to make it an effective counter to the Zero. In addition, the best European fighters were reaching almost 350 knots (650 km/h), and even relatively sluggish fighters like the Wildcat and the Kittyhawk were much faster.

As a result, by early 1942, the CA-14 variant was being designed, around the U.S.-built, 1,700 hp (1,268 kW) Wright Cyclone R-2600 engine, to address the CA-12's deficiencies in speed, climb and ceiling.<ref name= "Ross p. 321"/> However, the 145 Cyclones ordered were not delivered as scheduled, and in mid-1942, Wackett authorised use of the 1,850 hp (1,380 kW) turbo-supercharger mounted inside the rear part of the fuselage, new propellor gear, a Focke-Wulfs captured in Europe) and a larger, squared-off tailfin and rudder.<ref name= "Ross p. 321"/>

By July 1943, the significantly re-worked CA-14 prototype, now known as the CA-14A, had a top speed which was 25&ndash;30% better than the CA-12, and an operational ceiling which was 4,000 ft (1,200 m) higher.<ref name= "Ross p. 321"/> Overall, it compared favourably with the Spitfire Vc and early model Thunderbolts and Mustangs.<ref name= "Ross p. 321"/> By this time, however, British-built Spitfires had filled the interceptor role and Mustangs had been ordered, to fill the bomber escort, air superiority and close air support roles.<ref name= "Ross p. 321"/> In addition, work had begun on the all-new CA-15, also known as the Kangaroo. Consequently, production Boomerangs were never fitted with superchargers. 

Boomerangs underwent various improvements and modifications, which were grouped under three CAC designations: CA-12, '''CA-13''' and '''CA-19'''. A total of 250 aircraft of these marques were built: 105 CA-12s, (RAAF serial numbers A46-1/105), 95 CA-13s (A46-106/200) and 49 CA-19s (A46-201/249).<ref>[http://www.adf-serials.com/2a46.shtml adf-serials.com RAAF Museum 2007, "A46 CAC Boomerang"]. Retrieved: 5 December 2007.</ref> The CA-13 and CA-19 are sometimes known collectively as the Boomerang Mark II.

The sole CA-14A was used for research by No. 1 Aircraft Performance Unit RAAF, and was also seconded to the Bureau of Meteorology for a period after the war ended.<ref>[http://www.adf-serials.com/2a46.shtml adf-serials.com "RAAF A46 CAC CA-12/CA-13/CA-14/CA-19 Boomerang" 2007].

==Operational history==

Following the devastating first air raids on Darwin on Spitfire Mk Vc.

Two of the first three operational Boomerang units, No. 83 Squadron and No. 85 Squadron, were used for home defence. No. 84 Squadron was deployed to Horn Island in northern Queensland and to Dutch New Guinea (modern Irian Jaya) in an attempt to address the continuing shortage of fighters in this area. The squadron was only modestly successful however. The Boomerang's low top speed and poor high altitude performance meant that No. 84 Squadron could drive off enemy attacks but rarely get close enough to Japanese aircraft to bring their guns to bear. On the only occasion when a Boomerang did close with a Japanese aircraft, its guns froze. Fortunately, there were not many air raids in this area, and after using Boomerangs for eight months No. 84 Squadron upgraded to the Kittyhawk.

The Boomerang found its real use as a close support aircraft. In contrast to Europe or North Africa, the ground war in the jungles of the south-west Pacific was, in broad terms, an endless series of small unit actions fought at very close quarters by widely dispersed forces with no clear front lines. It was here that the Boomerang found its niche – as close to the troops on the ground as possible.  

It had the range to go wherever it was needed (usually the aircraft were based closed to the area of ground operations), heavy armament by the standards of the day and, because it was easier to fly than most fighters, the pilot could get in close to the objective and have time to concentrate on the ground forces. Sprightly low-level handling helped avoid ground fire and rough terrain and the unusually extensive armour plating protected pilots. In addition, the aircraft's simple wood and aluminium airframe proved capable of absorbing battle damage. Nonetheless, several of the aircraft were shot down - including two by US units, as the aircraft resembled a Zero from certain angles - and more were damaged during landing accidents, as the Boomerang was prone to ground looping.

No. 4 Squadron and No. 5 Squadron flew Boomerangs in Corsair fighter-bombers in Bougainville was said to be particularly effective.

The other user of Boomerangs in New Guinea was 8 Communications Unit, which used the aircraft to assist with air-sea rescue flights.
