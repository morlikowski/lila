'''Асоциацията на звукозаписната индустрия в Америка''' (''Recording Industry Association of America'', ''RIAA'') е основана през 1952 г. Нейната цел тогава е да създаде единни стандарти за грамофонните плочи, за да може всяка една от тях да бъде прослушвана на който и да е грамофон. В днешни дни асоциацията сертифицира продажбите на албуми и сингли и защитава правата на музикалната индустрия.

== Сертификации ==

Албумите и синглите могат да бъдат отличени като златни, платинени, мултиплатинени и диамантени.

За да добие един албум или сингъл съответната сертификация, трябва да бъдат продадени следният брой копия:

The '''Recording Industry Association of America''' (or '''RIAA''') is a trade group that  represents the major labels of the recording industry in the United States. Its members consist of a large number of private corporate entities such as record labels and distributors, which the RIAA claims "create, manufacture and/or distribute approximately 90% of all legitimate sound recordings produced and sold in the United States".<ref name="RiaaAboutUs"></ref><ref name="Big 4 Organised Music gang's RIAA"></ref>

The RIAA was formed in 1952 primarily to administer the music recording and reproduction, including cassette tapes and digital audio tapes), CDs and software-based digital technologies. 

The RIAA also participates in the collection, administration and distribution of music licenses and royalties.

The association is responsible for certifying gold and platinum albums and singles in the USA. For more information about sales data see List of best selling albums and List of best selling singles.

The RIAA's goals<ref name="RiaaAboutUs" /> are:
#to protect intellectual property rights worldwide and the First Amendment rights of artists;
#to perform research about the music industry;
#to monitor and review relevant laws, regulations and policies.

== Company structure and Sales==
As of April 2007, the RIAA is led by Mitch Bainwol, who has been Chairman and CEO since 2003. He is assisted by Cary Sherman, the President of the Board of Directors. The board of directors consists of 26 members of the board, drawn mostly from the big four members of the RIAA.<ref>[http://www.riaa.com/aboutus.php?content_selector=who_we_are_board Board of the RIAA] (RIAA website)</ref>

The RIAA represents over 1,600 member labels, which are private corporate entities such as record labels and distributors, and which collectively create and distribute about 90% of recorded music sold in the US. The largest and most influential of the members are the "Big Four":
* EMI
* Sony BMG Music Entertainment
* Universal Music Group
* Warner Music Group

The total annual net income from members of the RIAA is reported to be $11.5 billion<ref>[http://www.riaa.com/keystatistics.php] (RIAA website)</ref>, reflecting a decline since a high of $14.5 billion in 1999.

== Sales certification ==

The RIAA operates an award program for albums which sell a large number of copies.<ref>{{cite web

The criteria was changed in 1975 to be based on the number of copies sold, with singles and albums selling 500,000 copies awarded the Gold Award. In 1976, a ''Platinum Award'' was added for one million sales, and in 1999 a ''Diamond Award'' for ten million sales. The awards are open to both RIAA members and non-members.<ref>{{cite web

The RIAA also operates a similar program for Spanish language music sales, called ''Los Premios Awards''.

===“Digital” sales certification===
In 2004, the RIAA added a branch of certification for what it inexplicably calls “digital” recordings, meaning roughly “recordings transferred to the recipient over a network” (such as those sold via the CD, DAT, or MiniDiscs. In 2006, “digital ringtones” were added to this branch of certification. As of 2007, the certification criteria for these recordings are as follows:

*Silver: 100,000
*Gold: 500,000
*Platinum: 1,000,000
*Multi-Platinum: 2,000,000 (recertified at each million-unit interval)
*Diamond: 10,000,000

===Music Video Longform [sic] certification===
Along with albums, digital albums, and singles there is another classification of music release called "Music Video Longform." This style includes live albums, compilation albums, and greatest hits albums. The certification criteria is slightly different from other styles.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/riaa/video.jsp Billboard.com Latest Video Longform Certifications] Retrieved on May 14, 2008</ref>

*Gold: 50,000
*Platinum: 100,000

==Efforts against copyright infringement==
===Stance on home recording===

The RIAA has asserted apparently contradictory positions both for and against home recording, such as transferring the contents of music CDs to portable players or making backup copies of music CDs.

In a 2005 argument before the Supreme Court in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., counsel for the RIAA stated that "it's perfectly lawful to take a CD that you've purchased, upload it onto your computer, put it onto your iPod."

In 2006, the RIAA appeared to reverse its position, claiming that copying the contents of CDs or backing them up does not constitute fair use, because recordings transferred from CDs do not maintain controversial Digital Rights Management (DRM) to prevent the music file from being copied, and are therefore infringing under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, even though audio CDs (formally Compact Disc Digital Audio), by definition, ''have no DRM''. They argue that there is no evidence that any of the relevant media are "unusually subject to damage" and that "even if CDs do become damaged, replacements are readily available at affordable prices."<ref>''[http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004409.php RIAA Says Ripping CDs to Your iPod is NOT Fair Use]'', EFF Deep Links, 15 February 2006</ref>
