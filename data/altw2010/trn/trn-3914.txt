"'''Put 'Em Up'''" is Namie Amuro's 23rd solo single under the Avex Trax label. Produced by Dallas Austin, "Put 'Em Up" was meant for release in 2000 but was shelved until 2003. The song did not fare well upon release and is currently Amuro's lowest selling solo single.

== Overview ==
In early 2002, Amuro announced the release of her second greatest hits compilation, Chilli of the TLC. When it was first cancelled no explanation was given.

The song was finally prepared for release on Japanese lyrics for the song. She felt that the way Michico wrote the Japanese lyrics allowed her to express a side of herself that her old image prevented. She noted in the interview that had Michico not worked on the song with her that it probably would have been delayed indefinitely.

== Accolades ==
On February 5, 2004, "Put 'Em Up" was nominated for the "Best Your Choice" and "Best R&B Video" award at the Space Shower TV Music Video Awards. On March 16, 2004, she was also nominated for "Best R&B Video" and "Best buzzASIA from Japan" award at the MTV Japan Video Music Awards. Although she lost both Space Shower awards, she took home both awards for her nominations at the MTV awards.

The promotional video for "Put 'Em Up" premiered as an MTV Japan Exclusive on June 25, 2003. It was filmed in Kanagawa, Japan and directed by UGICHIN. The video takes place in an automechanic garage. Unlike many of Amuro's videos, it played up the theme of the song including using parts of the lyrics within it. The routine Amuro and her dancers performed in the video also featured choreographed fighting.
