'''Cyrax''' is a fictional character in the ''Mortal Kombat'' series.

==About Cyrax==
Making his debut in ''Sub-Zero for the Lin Kuei clan as designated unit LK-4D4. Of the three cyborgs, he has become the second to recover his humanity. This is due to the efforts of Sonya Blade and Jax. He has currently allied with them as a token of his appreciation.

==Storyline==
In ''Smoke in order to track down and kill a renegade member of the Lin Kuei clan, the younger Sub-Zero. This Sub-Zero had disagreed with the decision to convert all its members into cyborgs and left the clan. He was thus marked for death by the grandmasters.

During the invasion of Earthrealm by Shao Kahn and his minions, Sub-Zero defeated Cyrax and reprogrammed him with orders to destroy Shao Kahn. However, Kahn was defeated by the other Earthrealm warriors before Cyrax had a chance to do so. As a result of his reprogramming, he awaited new orders. When these never came, he malfunctioned and wandered until becoming mired in the middle of a vast desert. In ''Mortal Kombat Gold'', Cyrax was recovered and repaired by the Lin Kuei. However, he appeared somehow different than when first constructed. The short-handed clan again sent Cyrax into battle with his fellow cyborg Sektor assigned to monitor him.

After Shinnok's defeat, it became apparent that Cyrax had begun to experience flashbacks of his former life. Special agents Sonya Blade and Jax Briggs brought him to the Outer World Investigation Agency (OIA) headquarters and used its technology to restore his humanity. Grateful for their help, Cyrax joined the OIA as a scout in Earthrealm.

During the events of ''Moloch and Reptile orchestrated by the vampire Dragon King. There, Cyrax submerged himself in the lake of molten lava and discovered the orb that would separate her world from Outworld. With it now in her possession, she honored her promise to Cyrax. She used her mystical necklace to open a portal and send him back to Earthrealm.

In Cyrax's ''Armageddon'' ending, he defeats Blaze and is filled with elemental power that shatters his robot form and makes him human once again. Siding with Sub-Zero, he defeats Smoke. Sektor and Smoke are reprogrammed by the Lin Kuei and are held until they too regain their human forms.<ref name="MKAend">[http://mortalkombatwarehouse.com/mka/cyrax/ Cyrax's ''Armageddon'' info] at [http://www.mortalkombatwarehouse.com/ Mortal Kombat Warehouse]</ref>

'''Cyrax''' on hahmo Mortal Kombat -tappelupelisarjassa.

==Cyraxin elämäkerta==
Cyrax oli Smoken kanssa ja heidät käskettiin murhata nuorempi Sub-Zero. Hän oli eronnut klaanista vastustaessaan jäsenten muuttamista kyborgeiksi ja tästä syystä klaanin johtajat pitivät häntä vihollisenaan.

Samalla kun Shao Kahn hyökkäsi joukkoineen Earthrealmiin, Sub-Zero taisteli voitokkaasti Cyraxia vastaan ja ohjelmoi tämän tuhoamaan Kahnin. Earthrealmin soturit voittivat kuitenkin Kahnin ennen kuin Cyrax ehti puuttua asiaan. Hän jäi odottamaan uusia käskyjä harhaillen ympäriinsä. Käskyjä ei kuitenkaan tullut ja hän hajosi aavikolle. Myöhemmin Lin Kuein klaani kävi hakemassa Cyraxin takaisin ja korjasi hänet.

Cyrax alkoi muistaa asioita entisestä elämästään. Agentti Sonya Blade ja majuri Jackson Briggs (Jax) veivät hänet Outer World Investigation Agencyn (OIA) päämajaan ja teknologiaansa käyttäen palauttivat hänen ihmisyytensä. Kiitollisena heidän avustaan, Cyrax liittyi OIA:han vakoillen Outworldia.

Outworldissa Cyrax joutui Molochin ja Drahminin hyökkäyksen kohteeksi, mutta onnistui karkottamaan heidät. Hän joutui myös taisteluun Reptilea ja Nitaraa vastaan. Cyrax karkotti myös heidät, mutta hänen käsikonsolinsa, joka mahdollisti hänen paluunsa Earthrealmiin, vahingoittui taistelussa.
