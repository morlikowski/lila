'''Kurt Angle''' (Kurt Steven Angle) (Amerikaanse professionele worstelaar die in 1996 Olympisch  goud in het ''freestyle wrestling'' won. Tot 26 augustus 2006 was hij een professioneel worstelaar bij het vernieuwde ECW (Extreme Championship Wrestling). Kort daarna publiceerde hij een brief aan zijn fans die liet zien hoe moe hij was en dat hij tijd voor zijn eigen gezin nodig had. Dit bleek later echter een grote leugen te zijn nadat er op de TNA Pay-Per-View "No Surrender" bekend werd gemaakt, dat Angle bij TNA zou komen worstelen. In de WWE en ECW waren zijn finishing moves: Angle Slam, Ankle Lock. Hij gebruikt deze moves ook in TNA.

Verder wordt Angle gezien als een van de beste worstelaars ter wereld.

Toen hij net in de WWE begon, was het de bedoeling dat hij een face zou zijn, maar door zijn worstelstijl, gedrag in de ring, ging het publiek hem meer als een heel beschouwen. Hij wordt nu ook als een tweener beschouwd, iemand die allebei is.
Angle is 1.78m lang en weegt 107.5kg. Hij maakte zijn debuut in 1999 tegen Shawn Stasiak.
