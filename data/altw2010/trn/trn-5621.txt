'''Jiuquan''' (酒泉 | ''Jiǔquán Shì'') is a "prefecture-level city" in the westernmost part of the  Gansu province in China. 

The entire "prefecture-level city" (that is, a multi-county administrative unit - an equivalent to the traditional Chinese prefecture) stretches for more than 500 km from east to west, occupying 191,342 km²; its population as of 2002 was 962,000.

The city's name came from legendary tale of the young Han general Huo Qubing, who poured a jar of precious wine into a local creek in order to share the taste with his troops, in celebration of their crushing victory against Xiongnu forces. The creek was later named Jiu Quan ("Wine Spring"), which became the name of the Han prefecture established there.

== Suzhou town ==
The administrative center of the "District" of Suzhou (肃州区, Suzhou Qu), which occupies 3,386 square km in the eastern part of Jiuquan "prefecture-level city", and had the population of 340,000 as of 2002.
It is there where the modern mapmakers would usually place the "Jiuquan" label. 

The District of Suzhou corresponds to the historic town of Suzhou  (not to be confused with Suzhou in Jiangsu province).
It was founded in 111 BC as a military outpost on the Silk Road to Central Asia (the Hexi Corridor). It is approximately 1500 m above sea level.
