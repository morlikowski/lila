تصغير|فيروس الهربس البسيط
'''الهربس'''  هي اصابة فيروسية متكررة بسيطة (في العادة) تصيب الجلد، و تنتج عن الاعضاء التناسليه بالتقرحات ، او الارداف أو منطقة الجنس الفموي. يمكن للفيروس ان ينتشر و يعدي حتى عند عدم وجود القروح. كما يمكن ان تصيب الامهات اطفالهن اثناء الولادة. 

بعض الأفراد لا يظهرون اي اعراض للإصابة ، بينما أغلبية الأفراد يظهر لديهم قروح بالقرب من المنطقة التي دخل منها الفيروس إلى الجسم. تتحول هذه التقرحات إلى بثور ، و تصبح حاكة ومؤلمة ، ثم تلتئم لاحقا. هذا الفيروس يمكن ان يكون خطيرا عند حديثي الولادة أو في الأفراد ذوي جهاز المناعة الضعيف.

فيروس الهربس البسيط، ينتمي إلى عائلة فيروسات تسمى فيروسات الهربس تشمل عدة فيروسات مثل فيروس إيبشتاين-بارو الفَيْروسُ النُّطَاقِيُّ الحُماقِيّ الذي يسبب جدري الماء. و على الرغم من تواجد عدة أنواع من هذه العائلة إلا أن الإصابة بأحدها لا يعني الإصابة بباقي الأنواع بشكل آلي. 

يقسم الهربس البسيط إلى نوعان: فيروس الهربس البسيط من النوع 1 (hsv-1) وفيروس الهربس البسيط من النوع 2 (hsv-2). غالبية حالات الهربس الشفوي تنجم عن hsv-1 واغلبيه حالات هربس الاعضاء التناسليه تنجم عن hsv-2 ؛ ومع ذلك ، فالنوع - 1 أو النوع - 2 يمكن ان يتسببان بحدوث الإصابة في اي منطقة سواء الاعضاء التناسليه او الشفوية. 

==إنتقال العدوى==

اي شخص نشط جنسياٍٍ خارج نطاق [[زواج|الزواج يمكن أن يصاب بالهربس التناسليه. و يمكن أن ينقلها لاحقا إلى شريكه بعد الزواج. و الهربس ينتقل مباشرة من خلال إتصال الجلد مع الجلد. ويحدث هذا عندما يتم تماس بين جلد مصاب مع مع جلد به شقوق بسيطة أو اغشيه و أنسجة مخاطيه، كما هو الحال في الفم والأعضاء التناسلية. و في المقابل فالتلامس ضمن منطقة جلد سليم ضمن أعضاء الجسم الأخرى لن يؤدي إلى إصابة كون الجلد في باقي المناطق سميك جدا ليستطيع هذا الفيروس إختراقه. اذا قام شخص مصابا التناسلي بعملية بالتزاوج مع شخص سليم فإحتمال انتقال الهربس التناسلي له وارد جدا. و نفس الأمر لمن هو مصاب بالهربس الشفوي و قام بأداء جنس فموي لشخص سليم، فقد يؤدي ذلك أيضا إلى إصابة الشريك السليم يالهربس و لكم من النوع التناسلي. و العكس صحيح حيث يمكن لشخص مصاب بهربس تناسلي أن ينقل العدوى على شكل هربس شفوي عند عملية الجنس الفموي.

الهربس التناسليه يمكن ان تنتقل عن طريق الاتصال الجنسي سواء عند ظهور الأعراض ، و أحيان عند عدم وجود أعراض. فهنالك عدة أيام على مدار العام (تنشيط بدون أعراض، ذرف بدون أعراض أو ذرف دون سريري) يتواجد الفيروس خلالها على سطح الجلد بدون ظهور أعراض على الجلد. و يمكن أن ينتقل الهربس عن طريق الاتصال الجنسي خلال هذه الفترة. 

لا توجد حالات إصابات موثقه عن إصابات بالهربس التناسليه بسبب مقاعد المرحاض ، وأحواض الاستحمام ، او استعمال المناشف. فالهربس فيروس هش جدا و لا يعيش طويلا على اسطح الأغراض الخارجية كالمناشف و الأدوات.

'''Herpes simplex''' is a immunocompetent people.

Herpes viruses cycle between periods of active disease—presenting as blisters containing infectious remission period, during which the sores disappear. Genital herpes, however, is often sensory nerves, where they reside as life-long, latent viruses. Causes of recurrence are uncertain, though some potential triggers have been identified. Over time episodes of active disease reduce in frequency.

Herpes simplex is most easily transmitted by direct contact with a lesion or the body fluid of an infected individual. Transmission may also occur through skin-to-skin contact during periods of asymptomatic shedding. Barrier protection methods are the most reliable, but not failsafe, method of preventing transmission of herpes.  Oral herpes is easily diagnosed if the patient presents with visible sores or ulcers.  Early stages of orofacial herpes and genital herpes are harder to diagnose; laboratory testing is usually required. Prevalence of HSV infections varies throughout the world. Poor hygiene, overcrowding, lower socioeconomic status, and birth in an undeveloped country have been identified as risk factors associated with increased HSV-1 childhood infection. Additional studies have identified other risk factors for both types of HSV. 

There is currently no cure for herpes; no vaccine is currently available to prevent or eliminate herpes.  However, treatments are available to reduce viral reproduction and shedding, prevent the virus from entering the skin, and alleviate the severity of symptomatic episodes.

== Disorders ==

HSV infection causes several distinct medical disorders.  Common infection of the skin or mucosa may affect the face and mouth (orofacial herpes), genitalia (genital herpes), or hands (herpes whitlow).  More serious disorders occur when the virus infects and damages the eye (herpes keratitis), or invades the central nervous system, damaging the brain (herpes encephalitis).  Patients with immature or suppressed immune systems, such as newborn infants, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients are prone to severe complications from HSV infections.

In all cases HSV is never removed from the body by the immune system.  Following a primary infection, the virus enters the nerves at the site of primary infection, migrates to the cell body of the neuron, and becomes latent in the ganglion.<ref name="pmid18156035"/> As a result of primary infection, the body produces antibodies to the particular type of HSV involved, preventing a subsequent infection of that type at a different site. In HSV-1 infected individuals, seroconversion after an oral infection will prevent additional HSV-1 infections such as whitlow, genital herpes, and keratitis. Prior HSV-1 seroconversion seems to ameliorate the symptoms of a later HSV-2 infection, however HSV-2 can still be contracted. Most indications are that if an HSV-2 infection is contracted prior to HSV-1 seroconversion, that person cannot get an HSV-1 infection later.

Orofacial herpes affects the face and mouth.  Infection occurs when the virus comes into contact with oral mucosa or abraded skin.  Infection by the type 1 strain of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) is the most common cause of orofacial herpes, though cases of oral infection by the  type 2 strain are increasing.<ref></ref> 

Herpes infections are largely asymptomatic; when symptoms appear they will typically resolve within two weeks.<ref name="pmid15596324">{{cite journal

Other symptoms may also develop, including painful ulcers—sometimes confused with canker sores—fever, and sore throat.<ref name="pmid15596324"/> Primary HSV infection in adolescents frequently manifests as severe pharyngitis with lesions developing on the cheek and gums. Some individuals develop difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) and swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy).<ref name="pmid15596324"/>  Primary HSV infections in adults often results in pharyngitis similar to that observed in glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis), but gingivostomatitis is less likely. 

Recurrent oral infection is more common with HSV-1 infections than with HSV-2. Prodromal symptoms often precede a recurrence.  Symptoms typically begin with tingling (itching) and reddening of the skin around the infected site. Eventually, fluid-filled blisters form on the lip (labial) tissue and the area between the lip and skin (vermilion border).  The recurrent infection is thus often called ''herpes simplex labialis''. Rare reinfections occur inside the mouth  (''intraoral HSV stomatitis'') affecting the gums, alveolar ridge, hard palate, and the back of the tongue, possibly accompanied by  ''herpes labialis''.<ref name="pmid15596324"/><ref></ref>

Genital herpes is caused by HSV-2 more often than it is caused by HSV-1, although infections of the genitals by HSV-1 are increasing.

===Herpes whitlow===

Herpes whitlow (herpetic whitlow) is a painful infection that typically affects the fingers or thumbs.  Occasionally infection occurs on the toes or on the nail cuticle.  Herpes whitlow can be caused by infection by HSV-1 or HSV-2.<ref name="pmid14677662"></ref> HSV-1 whitlow is often contracted by health care workers that come in contact with the virus; it is most commonly contracted by dental workers and medical workers exposed to oral secretions.<ref name="pmid15119801"></ref><ref name="pmid12236568"></ref> It is also often observed in thumb-sucking children with primary HSV-1 oral infection (autoinoculation) prior to seroconversion,<ref name="pmid14677662"/> and in adults aged 20 to 30 following contact with HSV-2-infected genitals.<ref name="pmid17674583"></ref> 

Symptoms of herpetic whitlow include swelling, reddening and tenderness of the skin of infected finger. This may be accompanied by fever and swollen lymph nodes. Small, clear vesicles initially form individually, then merge and become cloudy. Associated pain often seems large relative to the physical symptoms. The herpes whitlow lesion usually heals in two to three weeks.<ref name="pmid5125276"></ref>

===Herpes gladiatorum===

Individuals that participate in contact sports such as wrestling, rugby, and soccer sometimes acquire a condition caused by HSV-1 known as herpes gladiatorum, ''scrumpox'', ''wrestler’s herpes'', or ''mat herpes''.  Abraded skin provides an area of entry for HSV-1.  Symptoms present within 2 weeks of direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected person. They include skin ulceration on the face, ears, and neck, fever, headache, sore throat and swollen glands.  It occasionally affects the eyes.  Physical symptoms sometimes recur in the skin.<ref name="pmid17939933"/> Previous adolescent HSV-1 seroconversion would preclude most herpes gladiatorum, but being that stress and trauma are recognized triggers, such a person would be likely to infect others.

Ocular herpes is a special case of facial herpes infection, known as herpes keratitis.  Occular herpes is generally caused by HSV-1. It begins with infection of epithelial cells on the surface of the eye and retrograde infection of nerves serving the superficial punctate keratitis), to formation of dendritic ulcers.<ref name="pmid10858770"></ref> Infection is unilateral, affecting one eye at a time.  Additional symptoms include dull pain deep inside the eye, mild to acute dryness, and sinusitis. Most primary infections resolve spontaneously in a few weeks.  Healing can be aided by the use of oral and topical antivirals. 

Subsequent recurrences may be more severe, with infected epithelial cells showing larger dendritic ulceration, and lesions forming white plaques.<ref name="pmid10858770"/> The epithelial layer is sloughed off as the dendritic ulcer grows, and mild inflammation (corneal stroma,<ref name="pmid10858770"/> resulting in loss of vision due to opacification of the cornea. This is known as immune-mediated stromal keratitis.
}}

Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is one of the most severe viral infections of the human central nervous system. It is estimated to affect at least 1 in 500,000 individuals per year.<ref name="pmid16675036"></ref> About 1 in 3 cases of HSE result from primary HSV-1 infection, predominantly occurring in individuals under the age of 18; 2 in 3 cases occur in seropositive persons, few of whom have history of recurrent orofacial herpes. Approximately 50% of individuals that develop HSE are over 50 years of age.<ref name="pmid11853816"></ref> 

HSE is thought to be caused by the retrograde transmission of virus from a peripheral site on the face following HSV-1 reactivation, along a nerve axon, to the brain.<ref name="pmid16675036"/> The virus lies dormant in the ganglion of the trigeminal cranial nerve, but the reason for reactivation, and its pathway to gain access to the brain, remains unclear.  The olfactory nerve may also be involved in HSE.<ref></ref> For unknown reasons the virus seems to target the temporal lobes of the brain.

Most individuals with HSE show a decrease in their level of consciousness and an altered mental state presenting as confusion, and changes in personality.  Increased numbers of white blood cells can be found in patient's cerebrospinal fluid, without the presence of pathogenic bacteria and fungi.  Patients typically have a fever.<ref name="pmid16675036"/> and may have seizures.  The electrical activity of the brain changes as the disease progresses, first showing abnormalities in one temporal lobe of the brain, which spread to the other temporal lobe 7–10 days later.<ref name="pmid16675036"/>

Without treatment, HSE results in rapid death in approximatley 70% of cases.<ref name="pmid16675036"/>  HSE is fatal in around 20% of cases treated, and causes serious long-term neurological damage in over half of survivors.  Only a small population of survivors (2.5%) regain completely normal brain function.<ref name="pmid11853816"/>

Neonatal HSV infection is a rare but serious condition, usually caused by vertical transmission of HSV from mother to newborn.  Only an estimated 10% of cases are acquired postnatally. Neonatal HSV rates in the U.S. are estimated to be between 1 in 3,000 and 1 in 20,000 live births. Approximately 22% of pregnant women in the U.S. have had previous exposure to HSV-2, and an additional 2%  acquire the virus during pregnancy, mirroring the infection rate in the general population.<ref name="pmid16199646">{{cite journal

Risk of transmission by a mother with existing antibodies for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 has a much lower (1-3%) transmission rate. This in part is due to the transfer of significant titer of protective maternal antibodies to the fetus from about the seventh month of pregnancy.<ref name="pmid12517231">{{cite journal

Complications of neonatal herpes rates are low birth weight and premature birth. Approximately one quarter of NHSV infected babies will have sepsis before the onset of herpes symptoms, further complicating diagnosis.  

HSV-1 neonatal herpes is extremely rare in developing countries because development of HSV-1 specific antibodies usually occurs in childhood or adolescence, precluding a genital HSV-1 infection.  HSV-2 infections are much more common in these countries. In industrialized nations, the adolescent HSV-1 seroprevalance has been dropping steadily for the last 5 decades. The resulting increase in the number of young women becoming sexually active while HSV-1 seronegative has contributed to increased HSV-1 genital herpes rates, and as a result, increased HSV-1 neonatal herpes in developed nations.  A recent three year study in Canada (2000-2003) revealed a neonatal HSV incidence of 5.9 per 100,000 live births. HSV-1 was the cause of 62.5% of cases of neonatal herpes of known type, and 98.3% of transmission was asymptomatic.<ref name=Kropp>{{cite journal

CNS herpes is an infection of the nervous system and the brain that can lead to encephalitis. Infants with CNS herpes present with seizures, tremors, lethargy, and irritability, they feed poorly, have unstable temperatures, and their fontanelle (soft spot of the skull) may bulge.<ref name="pmid12517231"/>  CNS herpes is associated with highest morbidity, and DIS herpes has a higher mortality rate. These categories are not mutually exclusive and there is often overlap of two or more types. SEM herpes has the best prognosis of the three, however, if left untreated it may progress to disseminated or CNS herpes with its attendant increases in mortality and morbidity. Death from neonatal HSV disease in the U.S. is currently decreasing; The current death rate is about 25%, down from as high as 85% in untreated cases just a few decades ago. Other complications from neonatal herpes include prematurity with approximately 50% of cases having a gestation of 38 weeks or less, and a concurrent sepsis in approximately one quarter of cases that further clouds speedy diagnosis.   

Reductions in morbidity and mortality are due to the use of antiviral treatments such as vidarabine and acyclovir.<ref name="pmid15685144"/><ref name="pmid11269641">{{cite journal

However, since HSV can also be detected in these ganglia in large numbers of individuals that have never experienced facial paralysis, and high titers of antibodies for HSV are not found in HSV-infected individuals with Bell's palsy relative to those without, this theory has been contested.<ref name="pmid15699730">{{cite journal

===Alzheimer's disease===

Scientists discovered a link between HSV-1 and Alzheimer’s disease in 1979.<ref></ref>  In the presence of a certain gene variation (APOE-epsilon4 allele carriers), HSV-1 appears to be particularly damaging to the nervous system and increases one’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.  The virus interacts with the components and receptors of lipoproteins, which may lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease.<ref name=Dobson1999>{{cite journal

==Recurrence==

Following active infection herpes viruses establish a latent infection in sensory and autonomic nucleus of a nerve's cell body.  HSV latency is static—no virus is produced—and is controlled by a number of viral genes, including Latency Associated Transcript (LAT).<ref name="pmid12409612"></ref>

Many HSV infected people experience recurrence within the first year of infection.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>  Prodrome precedes development of lesions. Prodromal symptoms include tingling (paresthesia), itching, and pain where lumbosacral nerves innervate the skin. Prodrome may occur as long as several days or as short as a few hours before lesions develop.  Beginning antiviral treatment when prodrome is experienced can reduce the appearance and duration of lesions in some individuals. During recurrence fewer lesions are likely to develop, lesions are less painful, and lesions heal faster (within 5–10 days without antiviral treatment), than those occurring during the primary infection.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>  Subsequent outbreaks tend to be periodic or episodic, occurring on average four to five times a year when not using antiviral therapy.

The causes of reactivation are uncertain, but several potential triggers have been documented. Physical or psychological stress can trigger an outbreak of herpes.<ref name="pmid11359358"></ref> Changes in the immune system during menstruation may play a role in HSV-1 reactivation.<ref name="pmid11022124"></ref><ref name="pmid4526372"></ref> Concurrent infections, such as viral upper respiratory tract infection or other febrile diseases, can cause outbreaks.  Reactivation due to infection is the likely source of the historic terms ''cold sore'' and ''fever blister''.

Other identified triggers include: local injury to the face, lips, eyes, or mouth, trauma, surgery, radiotherapy, and exposure to wind, ultraviolet light, or sunlight.<ref name="pmid18083428"></ref><ref name="pmid2821086"></ref><ref name="pmid1323616"></ref><ref name="pmid9377190"></ref><ref name="pmid15603217"></ref>

The frequency and severity of recurrent outbreaks may vary greatly between patients. An immunity to the virus is built over time; immunocompromised individuals may experience episodes that are longer, more frequent and more severe. Antiviral medication has been proven to shorten the frequency and duration of outbreaks.<ref name="pmid18192785"></ref>  Outbreaks may occur at the original site of the infection or in close proximity to nerve endings that reach out from the infected ganglia.  In the case of a genital infection, sores can appear at the original site of infection or near the base of the spine, the buttocks, back of the thighs.

==Transmission and prevention==

Herpes is contracted through direct contact with an active lesion or body fluid of an infected person.<ref name="titleAHMF: Preventing Sexual Transmission of Genital Herpes"></ref> Herpes transmission occurs between discordant partners; a person with a history of infection (HSV seropositive) can pass the virus to an HSV seronegative person.<ref name="pmid18156035"/> There are no documented cases of infection via an inanimate object (e.g. a towel, toilet seat, drinking vessels).  To infect a new individual, HSV travels through tiny breaks in the skin or mucous membranes in the mouth or genital areas. Even microscopic abrasions on mucous membranes are sufficient to allow viral entry.

HSV asymptomatic shedding occurs at some time in most individuals infected with herpes.  It can occur more than a week before or after a symptomatic recurrence in 50% of cases.<ref name="pmid16238897"/>  Infected people that show no visible symptoms may still shed and transmit virus through their skin; asymptomatic shedding may represent the most common form of HSV-2 transmission.<ref name="pmid16238897"></ref> Asymptomatic shedding is more frequent within the first 12 months of acquiring HSV. Concurrent infection with HIV increases the frequency and duration of asymptomatic shedding.<ref></ref>  There are indications that some individuals may have much lower patterns of shedding, but evidence supporting this is not fully verified; no significant differences are seen in the frequency of asymptomatic shedding when comparing persons with 1 to 12 annual recurrences to those that have no recurrences.<ref name="pmid16238897"/>

Antibodies that develop following an initial infection with a type of HSV prevents reinfection with the same virus type—a person with a history of orofacial infection caused by HSV-1 cannot contract herpes whitlow or a genital infection caused by HSV-1. In a monogamous couple, a seronegative female runs a greater than 30% per year risk of contracting an HSV-1 infection from a seropositive male partner.<ref name=Mertz1993>{{cite journal

}}</ref> If an oral HSV-1 infection is contracted first, seroconversion will have occurred after 6 weeks to provide protective antibodies against a future genital HSV-1 infection.

thumb|left|200px|Barrier protection, such as a [[condom, can reduce the risk of herpes transmission in some cases.]]
For genital herpes, condoms are highly effective in limiting transmission of herpes simplex infection.<ref name=Wald></ref><ref name=Casper></ref> The virus cannot pass through latex, but a condom's effectiveness is somewhat limited on a public health scale by their limited use in the community,<ref name=Visser></ref> and on an individual scale because the condom may not completely cover blisters on the penis of an infected male, or the base of the penis or testicles not covered by the condom may come into contact with free virus in vaginal fluid of an infected female. In such cases, abstinence from sexual activity or washing of the genitals after sex is recommended. The use of condoms or dental dams also limits the transmission of herpes from the genitals of one partner to the mouth of the other (or vice versa) during oral sex.  When one partner has a herpes simplex infection and the other does not, the use of antiviral medication, such as valaciclovir, in conjunction with a  condom, further decreases the chances of transmission to the uninfected partner.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>  Topical microbicides which contain chemicals that directly inactivate the virus and block viral entry are currently being investigated.<ref name="pmid18156035"/> Vaccines for HSV are currently undergoing trials. Once developed, they may be used to help with prevention or minimize initial infections as well as treatment for existing infections.<ref></ref>

As with almost all sexually transmitted infections, women are more susceptible to acquiring genital HSV-2 than men.<ref> </ref> On an annual basis, without the use of antivirals or condoms, the transmission risk of HSV-2 from infected male to female is approximately 8-10%. This is believed to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is approximately 4-5% annually. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios—meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom free—by about 50%. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk by 50%. Condom use is much more effective at preventing male to female transmission than vice-versa.<ref name=Wald/> The effects of combining antiviral and condom use is roughly additive, thus resulting in approximately a 75% combined reduction in annual transmission risk. These figures reflect experiences with subjects having frequently-recurring genital herpes (>6 recurrences per year). Subjects with low recurrence rates and those with no clinical manifestations were excluded from these studies. 

To prevent neonatal infections, seronegative women are recommended to avoid unprotected oral-genital contact with an HSV-1 seropositive partner and conventional sex with a partner having a genital infection during the last trimester of pregnancy. Mothers infected with HSV are advised to avoid procedures that would cause trauma to the infant during birth (e.g., fetal scalp electrodes, forceps and vacuum extractors) and, should lesions be present, to elect caesarean section to reduce exposure of the child to infected secretions in the birth canal.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>  The use of antiviral treatments, such as aciclovir, given from the 36th week of pregnancy limits HSV recurrence and shedding during childbirth, thereby reducing the need for caesarean section.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>

HSV seropositive individuals practising unprotected sex with HIV positive persons pose a high risk of HIV transmission, and are even more susceptible to HIV during an outbreak with active sores.<ref name="pmid18186706"></ref>

==Diagnosis==

Primary orofacial herpes is readily identified by clinical examination of persons with no previous history of lesions and contact with an individual with known HSV-1 infection. The appearance and distribution of sores in these individuals typically presents as multiple, round, superficial oral ulcers, accompanied by acute allergic stomatitis.  When lesions do not appear inside the mouth primary orofacial herpes is sometimes mistaken for impetigo, a bacterial infection. Common mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcer) also resemble intraoral herpes, but do not present a vesicular stage.<ref name="pmid17939933"/>
