南华女子学校（以下简称“南华”）于1917年4月17日由粤籍先贤熊尚父创立。他创立南华是为了女子，接受正规教育。建校初期，学校收生人数100人。由于位于哥罗门街（Coleman Street）的校舍太小，不足需求，1921年南华搬迁至明古连街(Bencoolen Street) 。

1924年，因经费不足，南华暂时关闭，在公众的支持下，南华才重新运作。

1928年，南华开办了师范课程。南华随即在1941年设立位于亚迪斯（Adis Road）路的主校，开办师范课程及一些小学课程，明古连街分校则指开办小学课程。

二战期间，南华关闭，日军用南华主校为总部。

新加坡光复后，南华筹款重建校舍，并开办高中课程。1956年，南华改称“南华女子中学”，1964年停收小学学生。分校则为现今南华小学。

新加坡独立后，由于新加坡的人口中心转至郊区，位于市区的南华收生逐年减少，故南华校董部1983年搬到金文泰新镇。翌年南华招收男生，并改名为“南华中学”。

由于校董部无法缴付搬迁的费用，1986年4月1日，南华校董部把学校管理交给新加坡政府，从政府资助学校改制为政府中学。

1999年，华文教育改革委员会建议南华成为特选学校。在教育部的批准下，南华于2000年起成为特选中学。

'''Nan Hua High School''' (Chinese: 南华中学) is a secondary school located in Clementi, Ministry of Education.

==History==

Nan Hwa Girls' School was founded on June 14 1917 by Mr Xiong Shangfu, an overseas Chinese. It was to provide an opportunity for young girls to receive an education. It originally had 100 Chinese girls but it grew so rapidly that its school campus at Coleman Street could not accommodate them. So a new school building had to be built at Bencoolen Street and it was ready in 1921.

However in 1924, due to financial problems, the school closed temporarily. It was only after a series of public appeals that debts were settled and the school re-opened.

By 1928 new programs such as a Teachers' Training Program (TTP) were being introduced, resulting in space constraints once again. Thus, a new campus located at Adis Road was completed in 1941. This campus was used to conduct the TTP and lessons for some primary classes were held there. Other students still studied at the Bencoolen Street campus. 

The school closed during February 1942 to September 1945 due to World War II. The Japanese Army used the Adis Road campus as their headquarters in Singapore.

:Years it takes to build a nation,<br>
:strive we to this end with valour always.<br>
:Nurture we from childhood through our youth,<br>
:finest essence spread we all our days.<br>
:Loving, loyal, filial, upright, courteous be.<br>
:Patient, tolerent and humble we shall be.<br>
:Work together each dutifully,<br>
:forward to the future eagerly.<br>

It also provided High school classes on top of the primary school lessons. The school's name changed to Nan Hwa Girls' High School in 1956 and stopped accepting primary school pupils in 1964, meaning the Adis Road campus was solely reserved for the high school students. The Bencoolen Street campus was also transformed into Nan Hua Primary School later on. Contrary to popular belief, there was no affiliation between Nan Hwa Girls' High School and Nan Hua Primary School.

The school moved to the campus in 330 Clementi Ave 1 on 12 December 1982. It had already opened English-medium classes then. In 1984 boys were also admitted, resulting in overenrolment. Following its transformation into a co-ed school, the name was changed to Nan Hua Secondary School. 

The School was unable to pay the $4 million for building the campus. Thus, on April 1 1986 it was handed over to the Government, ending its 69-year history as an aided school. More than a decade later, the school became the 10th SAP school under the 1999 Chinese Language Review.

On 20 December 2003 it moved again to 41 Clementi Avenue 1. It was officially opened on 17 July 2005 by Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of Singapore.

On 28 October 2005, it was officially announced that Nan Hua Secondary School would be renamed Nan Hua High School, starting from 1 January 2006.
