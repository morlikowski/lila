The '''whale shark''', ''Rhincodon typus'', is a slow filter feeding shark that is the largest living fish species. This distinctively-marked shark is the only member of its genus '''''Rhincodon''''' and its family, '''Rhincodontidae''' (called Rhinodontes before 1984), which is grouped into the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. The shark is found in tropical and warm oceans and lives in the open sea. The species is believed to have originated about 60 million years ago.<ref name=JurassicShark>''Jurassic Shark'' (2000) documentary by Jacinth O'Donnell; broadcast on Discovery Channel, August 5, 2006</ref>

==Naming==
The species was first identified in April 1828 following the harpooning of a  specimen in Andrew Smith, a military doctor associated with British troops stationed in Cape Town. He proceeded to publish a more detailed description of the species in 1849. The name "whale shark" comes from the fish's physiology; that is, a shark as large as a whale that shares a similar filter feeder eating mode. Known as a deity in a Vietnamese religion, the whale shark is called "Ca Ong", which literally translates as "Sir Fish"

==Distribution and habitat==
The whale shark inhabits the world's tropical and warm-temperate oceans. While thought to be primarily Isla Holbox in Pemba and Zanzibar. Though it is often seen offshore, it has also been found closer to shore, entering lagoons or coral atolls, and near the mouths of estuaries and rivers. Its range is restricted to about ±30 ° latitude. It is found to a depth of <ref name="fishbase"></ref>. The whale shark is solitary and rarely seen in groups unless feeding at locations with an abundance of food. Males range over longer distances than females (which appear to favor specific locations).

==Anatomy and appearance==
As a filter feeder, it has a capacious mouth which can be up to  wide and can contain between 300 and 350 rows of tiny teeth.<ref name="FAO"></ref> It has five large pairs of gills. Two small eyes are located towards the front of the shark's wide, flat head. The body is mostly grey with a white belly; three prominent ridges run along each side of the animal and the skin is marked with a "checkerboard" of pale yellow spots and stripes. These spots are unique to each whale shark and because of this they can be used to identify each animal and hence make an accurate population count. Its skin can be up to  thick. The shark has a pair each of dorsal fins and pectoral fins. A juvenile whale shark's tail has a larger upper fin than lower fin while the adult tail becomes semi-lunate (or crescent-shaped). The whale shark's spiracles are just behind the eyes.

In a 1925 publication, Hugh M. Smith describes a huge whale shark caught in a bamboo fish trap in Thailand in 1919. The shark was too heavy to pull ashore, but Smith estimated that the shark was at least  long, and weighed approximately 37&nbsp;tonnes (81,500&nbsp;lb), which have been exaggerated to a more precise measurement of  and weight 43&nbsp;tonnes in recent years. A shark caught in 1994 near Tainan county in Southern Taiwan is reported to have weighed 35.8 tonnes (78,887&nbsp;lb).<ref>http://homepage.mac.com/mollet/Rt/Rt_large.html</ref> There have even been claims of whale sharks of up to . In 1934 a ship named the ''Maurguani'' came across a whale shark in the Southern Pacific Ocean, rammed it, and the shark consequently became stuck on the prow of the ship, supposedly with  on one side and  on the other.<ref>Xavier Maniguet, ''Jaws of Death''; 1991.</ref> No reliable documentation exists of those claims and they remain little more than "fish-stories".

==Diet==
thumb|right|200px|A whale shark in the [[Maldives]]

The whale shark is a filter feeder — one of only three known filter feeding shark species (along with the basking shark and the megamouth shark). It feeds on phytoplankton, macro-algae, plankton, krill and small nektonic life, such as small squid or vertebrates. The many rows of teeth play no role in feeding; in fact, they are reduced in size in the whale shark. Instead, the shark sucks in a mouthful of water, closes its mouth and expels the water through its gills. During the slight delay between closing the mouth and opening the gill flaps, plankton is trapped against the dermal denticles which line its gill plates and pharynx. This fine sieve-like apparatus, which is a unique modification of the gill rakers, prevents the passage of anything but fluid out through the gills (anything above 2 to 3&nbsp;mm in diameter is trapped). Any material caught in the filter between the gill bars is swallowed. Whale sharks have been observed "coughing" and it is presumed that this is a method of clearing a build up of food particles in the gill rakers.<ref name="fishbase"/><ref name="RQBM"></ref><ref name="FLMNH"></ref>

Whale sharks congregate at reefs off the Belizean Caribbean coast, supplementing their ordinary diet by feeding on the roe of giant cubera snappers, which spawn in these waters between the full and quarter moons of May, June, and July. 

The whale shark is an active feeder and targets concentrations of plankton or fish by olfactory cues. Rather than simply "vacuuming" constantly, it is able to pump water over its gills. The shark can circulate water at a rate up to 1.7&nbsp;L/s (3.5&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;pint/s).  The whale shark does not need to swim forward when feeding; it is often observed in a vertical position, "bobbing" up and down swallowing water and actively filtering it for food. This is in contrast to the basking shark, which is a passive feeder and does not pump water; it relies on its swimming to force water over its gills.<ref name="RQBM" /><ref name="fishbase" />

==Behavior towards divers==

This species, despite its enormous size, does not pose any significant danger to humans. It is a frequently cited example when educating the public about the popular misconceptions of all sharks as "man-eaters". They are actually quite gentle and can be playful with divers. There are unconfirmed reports of sharks lying still, upside down on the surface to allow divers to scrape parasites and other organisms from their bellies.  Divers and snorkelers can swim with this giant fish without any risk apart from unintentionally being struck by the shark's large tail fin.

The shark is often seen by divers in The Bay Islands in Honduras, Thailand, the Philippines, the Maldives, the Red Sea, Western Australia (Ningaloo Reef and Christmas Island), Gladden Spit Marine Reserve in Belize, Tofo Beach in Mozambique, Sodwana Bay (Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park) in South Africa and at the Galapagos Islands.

The highest concentration of whale sharks to be found anywhere in the world is in the Philippines. From January to May, they congregate in the shallow coastal waters of Sorsogon province (at Donsol). Lucky divers have also come across whale sharks in the Seychelles and in Puerto Rico. Between December and September, they are well known to swim along the bay of La Paz in Mexico's Baja California. Sometimes, they are accompanied by smaller fish, in particular, the remora. Recently, they have been seen in the vicinity of Tenggol Island, off the east coast of West Malaysia.They are also frequently spotted around other Coral Reefs along the West Malaysian coast including Kapas Island and Redang Island.

Recently 150 whale sharks have been tagged and identifed off the coast off Hol Box island, Mexico. The island is located north of Cancun in the gulf of Mexico. They visit the island from June through August and more have been identified every year. It's possible through authorised tour guides you can experience swimming with these enormous creatures.

==Conservation status==
The whale shark is targeted by artisanal and commercial fisheries in several areas where they seasonally aggregate. The population is unknown and the species is considered vulnerable by the IUCN.<ref name="iucn"/> All fishing, selling, importing and exporting of whale sharks for commercial purposes has been banned in the Philippines since 1998,<ref>[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Sharks/InNews/Whaleshark.htm ''Whale Sharks Receive Protection in the Philippines'']</ref> India in May 2001,<ref> [http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/recovery/r-typus-issues/legal-status.html ''National Regulations on Whale Shark fishing'']</ref> followed by Taiwan in May 2007.<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/05/27/2003362648 ''COA bans fishing for whale sharks'']</ref>

'''Китовая акула''' () — самый крупный вид акул, а также самый крупный из ныне живущих представителей рыб. Хотя, по рассказам некоторых очевидцев, им встречались экземпляры длиной от 18 до 20 м, самый крупный когда-либо измеренный экземпляр насчитывал в длину 13,7 м. Вес китовых акул может достигать 12 т. Несмотря на внушительные размеры, китовая акула для человека абсолютно безопасна, так как питается подобно гигантской акуле и акуле-большероту исключительно планктоном и прочими мелкими организмами, которых она фильтрует, втягивая в себя воду.

Китовая акула является единственным видом в роде ''Rhincodon'', который в свою очередь единственный в семействе китовых акул (''Rhincodontidae''). Китовые акулы относятся к отряду воббегонгообразных.

==Внешние признаки==
Китовые акулы имеют серую, коричневую или синеватую окраску, при этом живот более светлый, а спина покрыта светлыми полосками и пятнами. У китовых акул есть два спинных плавника, а также грудные и анальные плавники и пять жаберных щелей. Крупная пасть тянется по всей ширине приплюснутой и притуплённой передней части головы. Благодаря величине и необычной окраске, китовых акул невозможно спутать с другими рыбами.

==Распространение==
thumb|250px|left|Китовая акула спереди
Китовые акулы предпочитают температуру воды от 21 до 25 °C и распространены по всему миру, встречаясь почти во всех тёплых тропических и субтропических морях. Особенно много их можно встретить в регионах с высоким сезональным содержанием планктона.

== Поведение==

Китовые акулы активно всасывают воду (до 6000 л/ч), пропуская её через свои жабры, оснащённые гребнеобразным фильтрационным аппаратом. Он состоит из хрящевых пластин, соединяющих отдельные жабровые дуги друг с другом как решётка, и на которых расположены кожные зубцы. Чтобы покрывать огромные потребности в пище, китовые акулы фильтруют из воды помимо планктона ещё и мелкую рыбу, а также других мелких обитателей морей.

===Размножение===
Среди китовых акул распространено живорождение.
