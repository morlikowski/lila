La '''deuxième guerre indo-pakistanaise''' (ou deuxième guerre du Cachemire) est un conflit armé qui a opposé l'Inde et le Pakistan en 1965.

En août 1965, le Pakistan lança l'opération Gibraltar, visant à infiltrer la province du Jammu-et-Cachemire par des soldats déguisés en civil devant provoquer une révolte et mener des actes de sabotage. Les infiltrés furent cependant rapidement repérés par les autorités indiennes et, en réaction, l'armée indienne ferma la frontière avant de franchir (le 15 août) la ligne de cessez-le-feu et d'attaquer la partie du Cachemire sous administration pakistanaise. Le Pakistan lança une contre-attaque le 1er septembre (opération Grand Slam) destinée à prendre le contrôle de la ville d'Akhnoor. Ce fut cependant un échec et, à nouveau, l'Inde réagit en envoyant ses troupes à la frontière entre les deux pays.

The '''Indo-Pakistani War of 1965''' was a culmination of the first having been fought in 1947. The war began following the failure of Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate and invade Jammu and Kashmir. The five-week war caused thousands of casualties on both sides. It ended in a United Nations (UN) mandated ceasefire and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration.

Much of the war was fought by the countries' land forces in Kashmir and along the 2001-2002 military standoff between India and Pakistan. Most of the battles were fought by opposing infantry and armored units, with substantial backing from air forces. Many details of this war, like those of other Indo-Pakistani Wars, remain unclear and many media reports have been riddled with media biases. 	

== Pre-war escalation ==

Since Partition of British India in 1947, Pakistan and India remained in contention over several issues. Although the Kashmir conflict was the predominant issue dividing the nations, other border disputes existed, most notably over the Rann of Kutch, a barren region in the Indian state of Gujarat. When Junagadh, a former princely state, had been integrated into India, its borders, especially in the marshlands to the west, remained ambiguous. On March 20, 1965, and again in April 1965, fighting broke out between India and Pakistan in the Rann of Kutch. Initially involving border police from both nations, the disputed area soon witnessed intermittent skirmishes between the countries' armed forces. In June 1965, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson successfully persuaded both countries to end hostilities and set up a tribunal to resolve the dispute. The verdict, which came later in 1968, saw Pakistan awarded 350 square miles (900 km²) of the Rann of Kutch, as against its original claim of 3500 square miles.<ref name=Rann>Bhushan, Bharat.

March 2005, Encyclopedia Britannica and [http://www.unidir.ch/pdf/articles/pdf-art267.pdf Open Forum - UNIDIR] </ref> 

After its success in the Rann of Kutch, Pakistan, under the leadership of General Ayub Khan, believed that the Indian Army was unable to defend itself against a quick military campaign in the disputed territory of Kashmir; the Indian military had suffered a loss to China in 1962.<ref name=globalsecurity>http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1965.htm "Indo-Pakistan War of 1965"]. <u>Globalsecurity.com</u>.</ref> Pakistan believed that the population of Kashmir was generally discontented with Indian rule and that a resistance movement could be ignited by a few infiltrating saboteurs. Pakistan attempted to ignite the resistance movement by means of a covert infiltration, codenamed '''Operation Gibraltar'''.<ref name=grandslam>Amin, Agha Humayun. Maj (Retd). [http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/sept/grand-slam.htm "Grand Slam &mdash; A Battle of Lost Opportunities"]. <u>Defence Journal</u>. September 2000</ref> The Pakistani infiltrators were soon discovered, however, their presence reported by local Kashmiris, and the operation ended in a complete failure.

Pakistan claimed to have been concerned by attempts of India to absorb Indian Constitution that allow the President of India to declare President's Rule in the disputed state.

On Jammu, which would sever communications and cut off supply routes to Indian troops. Attacking with an overwhelming ratio of troops and technically superior tanks, Pakistan initially progressed against Indian forces, who were caught unprepared and suffered heavy losses.<ref name=loc /> India responded by calling in its air force to blunt the Pakistani attack. The next day, Pakistan retaliated, its air force attacked Indian forces and air bases in both Punjab. Although Operation Grand Slam ultimately failed, as the Pakistan Army was unable to capture Akhnoor, it became one of the turning points in the war when India decided to relieve pressure on its troops in Kashmir by attacking Pakistan further south.

thumb|right|220px|Pakistan's Ichogil Canal was a vital barrier that needed to be crossed by Indian troops. This bridge across the canal was destroyed by the Pakistan Army before retreating.

India crossed the International Border on the Western front on September 6, marking an official beginning of the war.<ref name=storyofpakistan /> On September 6, the 15th Infantry Division of the Indian Army, under World War II veteran Major General Prasad, battled a massive counterattack by Pakistan near the west bank of the Ichogil Canal (BRB Canal), which was a ''de facto'' border of India and Pakistan. The General's entourage itself was ambushed and he was forced to flee his vehicle. A second, this time successful, attempt to cross the Ichhogil Canal was made over the bridge in the village of Barki, just east of Lahore. These developments brought the Indian Army within the range of Lahore International Airport. As a result, the United States requested a temporary ceasefire to allow it to evacuate its citizens in Lahore. 

One unit of the Jat regiment, 3 Jat, had also crossed the Ichogil canal and captured<ref>Brigadier Desmond E Hayde, "The Battle of Dograi and Batapore", Natraj Publishers, New Delhi, 2006</ref> the town of Batapore (Jallo Mur to Pakistan) on the west side of the canal. The same day, a counter offensive consisting of an armored division and infantry division supported by Sabres forced the Indian 15th Division to withdraw to its starting point. Although 3 Jat suffered minimal casualties, the bulk of the damage being taken by ammunition and stores vehicles, the higher commanders had no information of 3 Jat's capture of Batapore and misleading information led to the command to withdraw from Batapore and Dograi to Ghosal-Dial. This move brought extreme disappointment<ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050918/edit.htm#1 The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Opinions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> to Lt-Col Desmond Hayde, CO of 3 Jat. Dograi was eventually recaptured by 3 Jat on 21 September, for the second time but after a much harder battle due to Pakistani reinforcements.

On the days following India's 1st Armored Division, labelled the "pride of the Indian Army", launched an offensive towards Battle of ''Asal Uttar'' (Real Answer literally, or Fitting Response as the more appropriate English equivalent). The area became known as 'Patton Nagar' (Patton Town) as Pakistan lost or abandoned nearly 100 mostly US-made Patton tanks.

The war was heading for a stalemate, with both nations holding territory of the other. The Indian army suffered 3,000 battlefield deaths, while Pakistan suffered no less than 3,800. The Indian army was in possession of 710 mile² (1,840 km²) of Pakistani territory and the Pakistan army held 210 mile² (545 km²) of Indian territory.

===Aerial warfare===
:''See Main articles: Indian and Pakistan accounts on the air war.''

thumb|220px|PAF F-86 aircraft which took part in the war

The war saw the Indian Air Force and the Pakistani Air Force engaged in full scale combat for the first time since independence. Though the two forces had previously faced off in the First Kashmir War during the late 1940s, that engagement was limited in scale compared to the 1965 conflict. 

The two countries have made contradictory claims of combat losses during the war and hardly any neutral sources have verified the claims of either country. The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) claimed it shot down 104 IAF planes, losing only 19 in the process. The Indian Air Force (IAF) claimed it shot down 73 PAF planes, losing only 35 itself. According to Indian figures, the overall attrition rate was 2.16% for Pakistan Air Force and 1.49% for IAF.<ref>[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Books/Review-Airwar65.html Book Review]</ref> India also pointed out that, despite PAF claims of losing only a squadron of combat craft, Pakistan had been seeking urgent help from Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and China, for additional aircraft within 10 days of the beginning war.

Pakistan's main strike force comprised the U.S. made Sabre Slayer".<ref>Please see the main article Sabre Slayer for the complete list on this issue including sources.</ref> The Vampires to Hawker Hunters, many of which were outdated in comparison to PAF planes.

----

To maintain its air superiority, and to capitalise on the decisive edge it had gained in air combat, the PAF made several determined attempts between 8 and 23 September to lure the IAF into air engagements, through prolonged CAPs and even fighter sweeps. The original plan to maintain continuous operation over the Sialkot, Lahore and Kasur areas to deter the enemy from attacking Pak Army units and to intercept IAF close support aircraft.

Attempts were also made, particularly by the F-104s, to provoke the IAF into action by flying across the border into India. But the IAF invariably refused the challenge, although PAF fighters sometimes flew as far as Amritsar and beyond. Single F-104s patrolled almost daily for thirty minutes at a time between Halwara and Adampur at dawn and dusk without any Indian reaction, and at night the Starfighters penetrated as much as 100 miles into enemy territory to try and intercept the IAF Canberras, with no fear of opposition.

Even low level, daylight reconnaissance missions over the main IAF fighter airfields failed to produce any Indian reaction. One pilot from 9 Squadron, Flight Lieutenant Aftab Alam Khan, made as many as three visits during daylight to photograph Halwara, and found that the speed of the Starfighter gave the Indians no time to react at all, even after several passes over the airfield. The F-104s were also used to escort the slow photo reconnaissance RT-33s of 20 Squadron on missions deep into Indian territory, the presence of the Starfighters virtually guaranteeing that no air opposition would be encountered. A couple of Hunters were seen in the distance on one RT-33 escort mission to Halwara, but they stayed well clear of the PAF aircraft, which continued their task unmolested.

=== Tank battles ===

The 1965 war witnessed some of the largest tank battles since Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many 75 mm M3 L/40 gun. Besides the M4 tanks, India fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks. Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; its guns out-ranged those of the Indian artillery, according to Pakistan's Major General T.H. Malik.<ref>[http://orbat.com/site/history/historical/pakistan/aminkhemkaran.html The Battle for Ravi-Sutlej Corridor 1965 A Strategic and Operational Analysis] Major A.H.

India's tank formations experienced mixed results. India's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was turned back. One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armor, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations.<ref name ="Heginbotham" />

===Naval hostilities===

The Ghazi sank off the fairway buoy of Visakhapatnam near the eastern coast of India under unclear circumstances during the 1971 war, making it the first submarine casualty in the waters around the [[Indian subcontinent.  <!--Actual image is of USS Diablo, i.e. before it was rechristened PNS Ghazi when Pakistan purchased it, but it is the same vessel, nonetheless.-->]]
The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this.<ref name="Navy">South Asia's Nuclear Security Dilemma: India, Pakistan, and China By Lowell Dittmer, pp 77 ''</ref> On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles (300 km) south of the Pakistani port of Karachi. Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India. Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment. Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment"<ref>India's Quest for Security: defence policies, 1947-1965 By Lorne John Kavic, , 1967, University of California Press, pp 190</ref> of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value."<ref name="Navy" />

According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war. Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict.<ref>[http://www.nwc.navy.mil/press/Review/2002/spring/art4-sp2.htm THE INDIAN END OF THE TELESCOPE India and Its Navy] by Vice Admiral Gulab Hiranandani, Indian Navy (Retired), Naval War College Review, Spring 2002, Vol. LV, No. 2</ref> Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting. Some Pakistani defence writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbour.<ref>[http://www.defencejournal.com/march98/pak3wars1.htm Iqbal F Quadir] - Pakistan's Defence Journal</ref> There were, however, unconfirmed reports of underwater attacks near Bombay by the Indian Navy against what they suspected were American-supplied Pakistani submarines.

=== Covert operations ===
thumb|right|Pakistani troops drop from a C-130 Hercules onto Indian territory
The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases.<ref name=DJ1>[http://www.defencejournal.com/july98/1965war.htm Defence Journal: SSG in the 1965 War]</ref> On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group (SSG) commandos were parachuted into enemy territory. According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields(Halwara, Pathankot and Adampur). The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster".<ref name=DJ1 /> Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner (including one of the Commanders of the operations, Major Khalid Butt), and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians<ref>[http://www.pakdef.info/pakmilitary/army/regiments/ssg.html Pak Def - SSG Regiment]</ref> The reason for the failure of the  commando mission is attributed to the failure to provided maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation<ref name="fightergap">[http://www.defencejournal.com/may98/fightergap1.htm The Fighter Gap] by Shoab Alam Khan in Defence Journal</ref>  

Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations. As the Indian 14th Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles.<ref>[http://www.defencejournal.com/may98/thewayitwas1.htm Defence Journal: The Way it was] Extracts from Pakistan Army Brigadier (Retd) ZA Khan's book</ref>
