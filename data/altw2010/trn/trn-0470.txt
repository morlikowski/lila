'''Social Security''', in the United States, currently refers to the federal '''Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance''' ('''OASDI''') program.

The original Social Security Act<ref name="Social Security Act of 1935">Social Security Act of 1935</ref> and the current version of the Act, as amended<ref name="42 USC">[42 USC 7]</ref> encompass several social welfare or social insurance programs.  The larger and better known initiatives of the program are:

* Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance
* Unemployment Insurance
* Temporary Assistance to Needy Families
* Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled (Medicare)
* Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs (Medicaid)
* State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)
* Supplemental Security Income (SSI)

Social Security in the social insurance program funded through dedicated payroll taxes called Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). Tax deposits are formally entrusted to<ref name="42 USC 401">four'''</ref> Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, or Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund.  The main part of the program is sometimes abbreviated OASDI (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) or RSDI (Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance).  When initially signed into law by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1935, the term ''Social Security'' covered unemployment insurance as well. The term, in everyday speech, is used only to refer to the benefits for retirement, disability, survivorship, and death, which are the four main benefits provided by traditional private-sector pension plans. In 2004 the U.S. Social Security system paid out almost $500 billion in benefits.<ref name="www.ssa.gov.650"></ref> By dollars paid, the U.S. Social Security program is the largest government program in the world and the single greatest expense in the federal budget, with 20.9% for social security and 20.4% for Medicare <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/pdf/08msr.pdf MID-SESSION REVIEW, BUDGET OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, FISCAL YEAR 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
The Social Security Administration is headquartered in Woodlawn, Baltimore.

Largely because of solvency questions ranging from immediate crisis to large projected future shortfalls, reform of the Social Security system has been a major political issue for more than three decades during the presidencies of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.  (See Social Security debate (United States).)

__TOC__

==History== 
A limited form of the Social Security program began as a measure to implement "social insurance" during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when poverty rates among senior citizens exceeded 50%.<ref name="college.hmco.com.653"></ref>

===Creation: The Social Security Act===
thumb|250px|President Roosevelt signs Social Security Act, at approximately 3:30 pm EST on [[14 August Rep. Robert Doughton (D-NC); unknown person in shadow; Sen. Robert Wagner (D-NY); Rep. John Dingell (D-MI); unknown man in bowtie; the Secretary of Labor, MS); and Rep. David Lewis (D-MD).]]

The Social Security Act was drafted by President Roosevelt's committee on economic security, under Edwin Witte, and passed by Congress as part of the New Deal. The act was an attempt to limit what were seen as dangers in the modern American life, including old age poverty, unemployment, and the burdens of widows and fatherless children.  By passing this act, President Roosevelt became the first president to advocate the protection of the elderly.<ref>Achenbaum, Andrew. Social Security Visions and Revisions. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986. p. 26</ref>

====Provisions of the Act====
The Act is formally cited as the '''Social Security Act''', ch. 531, , now codified as . The Act is also known as the '''Old Age Pension Act'''. The Act provided benefits to retirees and the unemployed, and a lump-sum benefit at death. Payments to current retirees were (and continue to be) financed by a payroll tax on current workers' wages, half directly as a payroll tax and half paid by the employer. The act also allocated money to states to provide assistance to aged individuals (Title I), for unemployment insurance (Titles III), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (Title IV), Maternal and Child Welfare (Title V), public health services (Title VI), and the blind (Title X).<ref>ibid  p. 25</ref>

====Controversy====
Social Security was controversial when originally proposed, with one point of opposition being that it would cause a loss of jobs. However, proponents argued that there was in fact an advantage: it would encourage older workers to retire, thereby creating opportunities for younger people to find jobs, which would lower the unemployment rate. Historian Edward Berkowitz subsequently contended that the Act was a cause of the "Roosevelt Recession" in 1937 and 1938. However, the program has gone on to be one of the most popular government programs in American history.

Most women and minorities were excluded from the benefits of unemployment insurance and old age pensions. Employment definitions reflected typical white male categories and patterns.<ref>Mink, Gwendolyn. ''The Wages of Motherhood: Inequality in the welfare state, 1917-1942''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1995. p. 127</ref> Job categories that were not covered by the act included workers in agricultural labor, domestic service, government employees, and many teachers, nurses, hospital employees, librarians, and social workers.<ref>Quadagno, Jill. ''The Color of Welfare: How racism undermined the war on poverty''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1994. p. 7</ref> The act also denied coverage to individuals who worked intermittently.<ref>Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity: women, men, and the quest for economic citizenship in 20th century America''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 131</ref> These jobs were dominated by women and minorities. For example, women made up 90% of domestic labor in 1940 and two-thirds of all employed black women were in domestic service.<ref>ibid  p. 146</ref> Exclusions exempted nearly half the working population.<ref>bid  p. 130-1</ref> Nearly two-thirds of all African Americans in the labor force, 70 to 80% in some areas in the South, and just over half of all women employed were not covered by Social Security.<ref>ibid p. 157</ref><ref>Katznelson, Ira. ''When Welfare was White: The untold history of racial inequality in twentieth century America''. New York: W.W. Norton, 2005. p. 43</ref> At the time, the NAACP protested the Social Security Act, describing it as “a sieve with holes just big enough for the majority of Negroes to fall through.”<ref>ibid p. 48</ref> 

Some have suggested that this discrimination resulted from the powerful position of Southern Democrats on two of the committees pivotal for the Act’s creation, the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. Southern congressmen supported Social Security as a means to bring needed relief to areas in the South that were especially hurt by the Great Depression but wished to avoid legislation which might interfere with the racial status quo in the South. The solution to this dilemma was to pass a bill that both included exclusions and granted authority to the states rather than the national government (such as the states' power in Aid to Dependent Children). Others have argued that exclusions of job categories such as agriculture were frequently left out of new social security systems worldwide because of the administrative difficulties in covering these workers.<ref>ibid p. 44-5</ref>

Social Security reinforced traditional views of family life.<ref>Mink, Gwendolyn. ''The Wages of Motherhood'', 1995. p. 126</ref> Women generally only qualified for insurance through their husbands or their children.<ref>ibid p. 130</ref> Mothers’ pensions (Title IV) based entitlements on the idea that mothers would be unemployed.<ref>ibid p. 127</ref> 

The inherent discrimination in the system can also be seen with regard to Aid to Dependent Children. Since this money was allocated to the states to distribute, some localities assessed black families as needing less money than white families. These low grant levels made it impossible for African American mothers not work: one requirement of the program.<ref>ibid  p. 142</ref> Some states also had prohibitions against illegitimacy, an exclusion which affected African American women more than white women.<ref>ibid  p. 143</ref> One study determined that 14.4% of eligible white individuals received funding, but only 1.5% of eligible black individuals received these benefits.<ref> Katznelson, Ira. ''When Welfare was White'', 2005. p. 46</ref>

====Debates on the constitutionality of the Act====
In the 1930s, the Supreme Court struck down many pieces of Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, including the Railroad Retirement Act. In May, the Court threw out a centerpiece of the New Deal, the National Industrial Recovery Act, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and New York State's minimum-wage law. President Roosevelt responded with an attempt to pack the court via the Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937. On 5 February 1937, he sent a special message to Congress proposing legislation granting the President new powers to add additional judges to all federal courts whenever there were sitting judges age 70 or older who refused to retire.<ref>[http://www.supremecourthistory.org/01_society/01.html supremecourthistory.org]</ref> The practical effect of this proposal was that the President would get to appoint six new Justices to the Supreme Court (and 44 judges to lower federal courts), thus instantly tipping the political balance on the Court dramatically in his favor. The debate on this proposal was heated and widespread, and lasted over six months. Beginning with a set of decisions in March, April, and May, 1937 (including the Social Security Act cases), the Court would sustain a series of New Deal legislation.

Two Supreme Court rulings affirmed the constitutionality of the Social Security Act.
* ''general welfare". The arguments opposed to the Social Security Act (articulated by justices Butler, McReynolds, and Sutherland in their opinions) were that the social security act went beyond the powers that were granted to the federal government in the Constitution. They argued that, by imposing a tax on employers that could be avoided only by contributing to a state unemployment-compensation fund, the federal government was essentially forcing each state to establish an unemployment-compensation fund that would meet its criteria, and that the federal government had no power to enact such a program.

*''Helvering v. Davis'', 301 U.S. 619 (1937), decided on the same day as ''Steward'', upheld the program because "The proceeds of both [employee and employer] taxes are to be paid into the Treasury like internal-revenue taxes generally, and are not earmarked in any way". That is, the Social Security Tax was constitutional as a mere exercise of Congress's general taxation powers.

====Implementation====
Payroll taxes were first collected in 1937, also the year in which the first benefits were paid, namely the lump-sum death benefit paid to 53,236 beneficiaries.

The first monthly payment was issued on Brattleboro, Vermont.

===Expansion and evolution===

The provisions of Social Security have been changing since the 1930s, shifting in response to economic worries as well as concerns over changing gender roles and the position of minorities. Officials have responded more to the concerns of women than those of minority groups.<ref>Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 124</ref> Social Security gradually moved toward universal coverage. By 1950, debates moved away from which occupational groups should be included to how to provide more adequate coverage.<ref>Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 156</ref> Changes in Social Security have reflected a balance between promoting equality and efforts to provide adequate protection.<ref name="autogenerated7">Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 130</ref>

In 1940, benefits paid totaled $35 million. These rose to $961 million in 1950, $11.2 billion in 1960, $31.9 billion in 1970, $120.5 billion in 1980, and $247.8 billion in 1990 (all figures in nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation). In 2004, $492 billion of benefits were paid to 47.5 million beneficiaries.

====1939 Amendments====
'''''Economic concerns'''''<br>
One reason for the proposed changes in 1939 was a growing concern over the impact that the reserves created by the 1935 act were having on the economy. The Recession of 1937 was blamed on the government, tied to the abrupt decrease in government spending and the $2 billion that had been collected in Social Security taxes.<ref>ibid, p. 30</ref> Benefits became available in 1940 instead of 1942 and changes to the benefit formula increased the amount of benefits available to all recipients in the early years of Social Security.<ref>ibid, p. 33</ref> These two policies combined to shrink the size of the reserves. The original Act had conceived of the program as paying benefits out of a large reserve. This Act shifted the conception of Social Security into the pay-as-you-go system.<ref>Berstein, Merton and Joan. ''Social Security: The System that Works''. New York: Basic Books, Inc., (1988). p. 10</ref> 

'''''Creation of the Social Security Trust Fund'''''<br>
The amendments established a trust fund for any surplus funds. The managing trustee of this fund is the Secretary of the Treasury. The money could be invested in both non-marketable and marketable securities.<ref>www.ssa.gov/history/BudgetTreatment</ref>

'''''The move toward family protection'''''<br>
Calls for reform of Social Security emerged within a few years of the 1935 Act. Even as early as 1936, some believed that women were not getting enough support. Worried that a lack of assistance might push women back into the work force, these individuals wanted Social Security changes that would prevent this. In an effort to protect the family, therefore, some called for reform which tied women's aid more concretely to their dependency on their husbands.<ref> Mink, Gwendolyn. ''The Wages of Motherhood'', 1995. p. 134</ref> Others expressed apprehension about the complicated administrative practices of Social Security.<ref>Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions''. p. 30</ref> Concerns about the size of the reserve fund of the retirement program, emphasized by a recession in 1937 led to further calls for change.<ref>ibid  p. 27, 30</ref>

These amendments, however, avoided the question of the large numbers of workers in excluded categories.<ref>Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 134</ref> Instead, the amendments of 1939 made family protection a part of Social Security. This included increased federal funding for the Aid to Dependent Children and raised the maximum age of children eligible to receive money under the Aid to Dependent Children to 18. The amendment added wives, elderly widows, and dependent survivors of covered male workers to those who could receive old age pensions. These individuals had previously only been granted lump sum payments upon death or coverage through the Aid to Dependent Children program. If a married wage-earning woman’s own benefit was worth less than 50% of her husband’s benefit, she was treated as a wife, not a worker.<ref>Mink, Gwendolyn. ''The Wages of Motherhood'', 1995. p. 135-6</ref> If a woman who was covered by Social Security died, however, her dependents were ineligible for her benefits.<ref>Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 141</ref> Since support for widows was dependent on the husband being a covered worker, African American widows were severely underrepresented and unaided by these changes.<ref>Mink, Gwendolyn. ''The Wages of Motherhood'', 1995. p. 137</ref> 

In order to assure fiscal conservatives who worried about the costs of adding family protection policies, the benefits for single workers were decreased and lump-sum death payments were abolished.<ref>Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p.34</ref>

'''''FICA'''''<br>
right|200px|thumb|A poster for the expansion of the Social Security Act
Social Security payroll taxes are collected under authority of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). The payroll taxes are sometimes even called "FICA taxes."

In the original 1935 law the benefit provisions were in Title II of the Act (which is why Social Security is sometimes referred to as the "Title II" program.) The taxing provisions were in a separate title, Title VIII. There is a deep reason for this, having to do with the constitutionality of the law (see discussion of the Constitutionality of the 1935 Act).

As part of the 1939 Amendments, the Title VIII taxing provisions were taken out of the Social Security Act and placed in the Internal Revenue Code. Since it wouldn't make any sense to call this new section of the Internal Revenue Code "Title VIII," it was renamed the "Federal Insurance Contributions Act."

The payroll taxes collected for Social Security are of course taxes, but they can also be described as contributions to the social insurance system that is Social Security. Hence the name "Federal Insurance Contributions Act." FICA refers to the tax provisions of the Social Security Act, as they appear in the Internal Revenue Code.

====Amendments of the 1950s====
After years of debates about the inclusion of domestic labor, household employees working at least two days a week for the same person were added in 1950, along with nonprofit workers and the self-employed. Hotel workers, laundry workers, all agricultural workers, and state and local government employees were added in 1954.<ref>Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 150</ref> 

In 1956, the tax rate was raised to 4.0% (2.0% for the employer, 2.0% for the employee) and disability benefits were added. Also in 1956, women were allowed to retire at 62 with benefits reduced by 25%. Widows of covered workers were allowed to retire at 62 without the reduction in benefits.<ref>ibid p. 161</ref>

====Amendments of the 1960s====
In 1961, retirement at age 62 was extended to men, and the tax rate was increased to 6.0%.

In 1962, the changing role of the female worker was acknowledged when benefits of covered women could be collected by dependent husbands, widowers, and children. These individuals, however, had to be able to prove their dependency.<ref>Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 161</ref>

Medicare was added in 1965 by the Social Security Act of 1965, part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's "Great Society" program. Social Security was changed to withdraw funds from the independent "Trust Fund" and put it into the General Fund for additional congressional revenue.

In 1965, the age at which widows could begin collecting benefits was reduced to 60. Widowers were not included in this change. When divorce, rather than death, became the major cause of marriages ending, divorcées were added to the list of recipients. Divorcées over the age of 65 who had been married for at least 20 years, remained unmarried, and could demonstrate dependency on their ex-husbands received benefits.<ref>Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 129</ref>

The government adopted a unified budget in the Johnson administration in 1968. This change resulted in a single measure of the fiscal status of the government, based on the sum of all government activity.<ref name="autogenerated6">www.ssa.gov/history/BudgetTreatment.html</ref> The surplus in Social Security trust funds offsets the total debt, making it appear much smaller than it otherwise would.

====Amendments of the 1970s====
'''''1972 Amendments'''''<br>
In June 1972, both houses of the United States Congress approved by overwhelming majorities 20% increases in benefits for 27.8 million Americans. The average payment per month rose from $133 to $166. The bill also set up a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to take effect in 1975. This adjustment would be made on a yearly basis if the Consumer Price Index increased by 3% or more.<ref>Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 58</ref> This addition was an attempt to index benefits to inflation so that benefits would rise automatically. If inflation was 5%, the goal was to automatically increase benefits by 5% so their real value didn't decline. Unfortunately, however, there was a technical error in the formula that caused these adjustments to overcompensate for inflation, a technical mistake which has been called double-indexing. The COLAs actually caused benefits to increase at twice the rate of inflation.

In October 1972, a $5 billion piece of Social Security legislation was enacted which expanded the Social Security program. For example, minimum monthly benefits of individuals employed in low income positions for at least 30 years were raised. Increases were also made to the pensions of 3.8 million widows and dependent widowers.<ref>ibid p. 58</ref> 

These amendments also established the Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Immigrants who had never paid into the system became eligible for SSI benefits when they reached age 65. SSI is not a Social Security benefit, but a welfare program, because the elderly and disabled poor are entitled to SSI regardless of work history. Likewise, SSI is not an entitlement, because there is no right to SSI payments.

'''''Social concerns'''''<br>
The impact of Social Security on women and minorities was analyzed during the early 1970s as both groups became increasingly vocal. Minorities noted that lower incomes and shorter life expectancies made their Social Security benefits insufficient. Women complained about the gender biases in Social Security. For example, many feminists argued that women continued to receive pensions through their relationships to male covered workers, a status which did not reflect the changing role of women in American culture.<ref>ibid p. 64</ref> The 1975 Quadrennial Council on Social Security proposed many ideas to extend the coverage of Social Security. Yet concern over the economy and the financial outlook of Social Security dominated this time period.  

'''''The 1970s and the negative financial outlook'''''<br>
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, during the phase-in period of Social Security, Congress was able to grant generous benefit increases because the system had perpetual short-run surpluses.  Congressional amendments to Social Security took place in even numbered years (election years) because the bills were politically popular, but by the late 1970s, this era was over.  For the next three decades, projections of Social Security's finances would show large, long-term deficits, and in the early 1980s, the program flirted with immediate insolvency.  From this point on, amendments to Social Security would take place in odd numbered years (years that were not election years) because Social Security reform now meant tax increases and benefit reductions.  Social Security became known as the "Third Rail of American Politics."  Touching it meant political death.

Several effects came together in the years following the 1972 amendments which rapidly changed the outlook on Social Security's long-term financial picture from positive to problematic.  By the 1970s, the phase-in period, during which workers were paying taxes but few were collecting benefits, was largely over, and the ratio of elderly population to the working population was increasing. These developments brought questions about the capacity of the long term financial structure based on a pay-as-you-go program.

During the Carter administration, the economy suffered double-digit inflation, coupled with very high interest rates, oil shortages, high unemployment and slow economic growth. Productivity growth in the United States had declined to an average annual rate of 1%, compared to 3.2% during the 1960s. There was also a growing federal budget deficit which increased to $66 billion. The 1970s are described as a period of stagflation, meaning economic stagnation coupled with price inflation, as well as higher interest rates. Price inflation (a rise in the general level of prices) creates uncertainty in budgeting and planning and makes labor strikes for pay raises more likely.

These underlying negative trends were exacerbated by a colossal mathematical error made in the 1972 amendments establishing the COLAs. The mathematical error which overcompensated for inflation was particularly detrimental given the double-digit inflation of this period, and the error led to benefit increases that were nowhere near financially sustainable.

The high inflation, double-indexing, and lower than expected wage growth was financial disaster for Social Security.

'''''1977 Amendments'''''<br>
To combat the declining financial outlook, in 1977 Congress passed and President Carter signed legislation fixing the double-indexing mistake. This amendment also altered the tax formulas to raise more money.<ref>ibid p. 67</ref> With these changes, President Carter remarked, "Now this legislation will guarantee that from 1980 to the year 2030, the Social Security funds will be sound."<ref>Sylvester J. Schieber and John. B. Shoven, ''The Real Deal: the History and Future of Social Security''. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1999), p. 182</ref>  This turned out to be not the case.  The financial picture declined almost immediately and by the early 1980s, the system was again in crisis.

====Amendments of the 1980s====
After the 1977 amendments, the economic assumptions surrounding Social Security projections continued to be overly optimistic as the program moved toward a crisis. For example, COLAs were attached to increases in the CPI. This meant that they changed with prices, instead of wages. Before the 1970s, wage measurements exceeded changes in price. In the 1970s, however, this reversed and real wages decreased. This meant that FICA revenues could not keep up with the increasing benefits that were being given out. Continued high unemployment levels also lowered the amount of Social Security tax that could be collected. These two developments were decreasing the Social Security Trust Fund reserves.<ref>Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 68 </ref> In 1982, projections indicated that the Social Security Trust Fund would run out of money by 1983, and there was talk of the system being unable to pay benefits.<ref>Sylvester J. Schieber and John. B. Shoven, ''The Real Deal'', 1999, p. 190</ref> The National Commission on Social Security Reform, chaired by Alan Greenspan was created to address the crisis.

'''''The 1983 Amendments'''''<br>
The National Commission on Social Security Reform (NCSSR), chaired by Alan Greenspan, was empaneled to investigate the long-run solvency of Social Security. The 1983 Amendments to the SSA were based on the NCSSR's Final Report. The NCSSR recommended enacting a six-month delay in the COLA and changing the tax-rate schedules for the years between 1984 and 1990.<ref>Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 87</ref> It also proposed an income tax on the Social Security benefits of higher-income individuals. This meant that benefits in excess of a household income threshold, generally $25,000 for singles and $32,000 for couples (the precise formula computes and compares three different measures) became taxable. These changes were important for generating revenue in the short term. 

Also of concern was the long-term prospect for Social Security because of demographic considerations. Of particular concern was the issue of what would happen when people born during the post-World War II baby boom retired. The NCSSR made several recommendations for addressing the issue. <ref name="www.ssa.gov.656"></ref> Under the 1983 amendments to Social Security, signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, a previously-enacted increase in the payroll tax rate was accelerated, additional employees were added to the system, the full-benefit retirement age was slowly increased, and up to one-half of the value of the Social Security benefit was made potentially taxable income.  <ref name="www.ssa.gov.657"></ref><ref>See .</ref>

'''''The 1983 Amendments and the Social Security Trust Fund'''''<br>
The 1983 Amendments also included a provision to exclude the Social Security Trust Fund from the unified budget (in political jargon, it was taken “off-budget”). This provision also provided for the exemption of Social Security and portions of the Medicare trust funds from any general budget cuts beginning in 1993.<ref name="autogenerated6" /> This change was one way of trying to protect Social Security funds for the future. 

As a result of these changes, particularly the tax increases, the Social Security system began to generate a large short-term surplus of funds, intended to cover the added retirement costs of the "baby boomers."  Congress invested these surpluses into special series, non-marketable U.S. Treasury securities held by the Social Security Trust Fund. Under the law, the government bonds held by Social Security are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Because the government had adopted the unified budget during the Johnson administration, this surplus offsets the total fiscal debt, making it look much smaller. There has been significant disagreement over whether the Social Security Trust Fund has been saved, or has been used to finance other government programs and other tax cuts.

====The Supreme Court and the evolution of Social Security====
The Supreme Court was responsible for major changes in Social Security. Many of these cases were pivotal in changing the assumptions about differences in wage earning among men and women in the Social Security system.<ref>Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 168</ref>

*Fourteenth Amendment required there to be an evidentiary hearing before a recipient can be deprived of government benefits.<ref name="autogenerated7" />
*Weinburger v. Wiesenfeld (1975): A widower claimed that he was entitled to his deceased wife’s benefit, even though he had not been dependent on his wife. The court upheld his claims, stating that automatically granting widows the benefits and denying them to widowers violated equal protection in the Fifth Amendment.<ref>ibid p. 131</ref>

==Retirement, auxiliary, survivors, and disability benefits==
The largest component of OASDI is the payment of retirement benefits.  Throughout a worker's career, the Social Security Administration keeps track of his or her earnings.  The amount of the monthly benefit to which the worker is entitled depends upon that earnings record and upon the age at which the retiree chooses to begin receiving benefits.  For the entire history of Social Security, benefits have been paid almost entirely by using revenue from payroll taxes.  This is why Social Security is referred to as a pay-as-you-go system.  In approximately a decade (2019), payroll tax revenue is projected to be insufficient to cover Social Security benefits and the system will begin to withdraw money from the Social Security Trust Fund.  The existence and economic significance of the Social Security Trust Fund is a subject of considerable dispute because its assets are special Treasury bonds; i.e., the money in the trust fund have been loaned back to the federal government to pay for other expenses (hence it is said that the fund consists of nothing but "IOUs").

The Supreme Court decided, in ''Flemming v. Nestor'' (1960), that "entitlement to Social Security benefits is not a contractual right". In that case, Ephram Nestor, a Bulgarian immigrant to the United States who made contributions for covered wages for the statutorily required "quarters of coverage" was nonetheless denied benefits after being deported in 1956 for being a member of the Communist party.  

The case specifically held:

<blockquote>'''2.''' A person covered by the Social Security Act has not such a right in old-age benefit payments as would make every defeasance of "accrued" interests violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Pp. 608-611.    '''(a)'''  The noncontractual interest of an employee covered by the Act cannot be soundly analogized to that of the holder of an annuity, whose right to benefits are based on his contractual premium payments. Pp. 608-610.    '''(b)'''  To engraft upon the Social Security System a concept of "accrued property rights" would deprive it of the flexibility and [363 U.S. 603, 604]   boldness in adjustment to ever-changing conditions which it demands and which Congress probably had in mind when it expressly reserved the right to alter, amend or repeal any provision of the Act. Pp. 610-611.    '''3.'''  Section 202 (n) of the Act cannot be condemned as so lacking in rational justification as to offend due process. Pp. 611-612.    '''4.'''  Termination of appellee's benefits under 202 (n) does not amount to punishing him without a trial, in violation of Art. III, 2, cl. 3, of the Constitution or the Sixth Amendment; nor is 202 (n) a bill of attainder or ex post facto law, since its purpose is not punitive. Pp. 612-621.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=363&invol=603 FindLaw for Legal Professionals - Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>

In simple terms, the decision means that Congress can cut benefits at any time.  

===Primary Insurance Amount===
A worker's retirement income benefit is based on his Primary Insurance Amount, or PIA.  The PIA is the average of the highest 35 years of the worker's covered earnings (before deduction for FICA). Covered earnings in any year are limited by that year's Social Security Wage Base, the maximum earnings that could be subject to the OASDI portion of FICA payroll tax ($102,000 in 2008 <ref>[http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070508/BUSINESS01/705080329 http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070508/BUSINESS01/705080329]</ref>). If the worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings, zeros are used to bring the total number of years of earnings up to 35. Years of covered work more than 2 years before the year the worker turns 62 are indexed upward to reflect the increase in the national wage via the average wage index (AWI) from the time at which the earnings were covered in the past to the value of the AWI two years before the worker turns 62 (which is the most recent year available at the date the worker turns 62). One-twelfth of this 35-year average is the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). The PIA then is 90% of the AIME up to the first (low) bendpoint, and 32% of the excess of AIME over the first bendpoint but not in excess of the second (high) bendpoint, plus 15% of the AIME in excess of the second bendpoint.  Bendpoints designate the point at which the rates of return on a beneficiary's AIME change<ref>[http://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/policybriefs/pb2007-01.html Social Security Administration "Considerations for Potential Proposals to Change the Earliest Eligibility Age for Retirement"]</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">[https://s044a90.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0300605021!opendocument POMS RS 00605.021]</ref>. In 2008, the bendpoints for calculating the PIA are a change from 90% to 32% at $711 and a change to 15% at $4,288.<ref>[http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/COLA/bendpoints.html Social Security Administration "Benefit Formula Bend Points"]</ref><ref name="autogenerated1" />  This PIA is then adjusted by automatic cost-of-living adjustments annually starting with the year the worker turns 62.   Similar computations based on career average earnings determine disability and survivor benefits.  These alternate computations average less years of earnings when the worker dies or is disabled before age 62 and use different base years for the inflation adjustments.

===Normal retirement age===

The earliest age at which (reduced) benefits are payable is 62. Full retirement benefits depend on a retiree's year of birth.<ref></ref> Those born before 1938 have a normal retirement age of 65. Normal retirement age increases by two months for each ensuing year of birth until the 1943 year of birth, when it stays at age 66 years until the year of birth 1955. Thereafter the normal retirement age increases again by two months for each year ending in the 1960 year of birth, when normal retirement age stops at age 67 for all born thereafter.

A worker who starts benefits before normal retirement age has their benefit reduced based on the number of months before normal retirement age they start benefits.  This reduction is 5/9 of 1% for each month up to 36 and then 5/12 of 1% for each additional month.  This formula gives an 80% benefit at age 62 for a worker with a normal retirement age of 65, a 75% benefit at age 62 for a worker with a normal retirement age of 66, and a 70% benefit at age 62 for a worker with a normal retirement age of 67. 

A worker who delays starting retirement benefits past normal retirement age earns delayed retirement credits that increase their benefit until they reach age 70. These credits are also applied to their widow(er)'s benefit.  Children and spouse benefits are not affected by these credits.

The normal retirement age for widow(er) benefits shifts the year-of-birth schedule upward by two years, so that those widow(er)s born before 1940 have age 65 as their normal retirement age.  

===Spouse's benefit===
Any current spouse is eligible, and divorced or former spouses are eligible generally if the marriage lasts for at least 10 years.  (State marriages of same sex couples are not recognized by OASDI for spousal benefits because the federal DOMA law excluded them for federal recognition for federal rights.±)  While it is arithmetically possible for one worker to generate spousal benefits for up to five of his/her spouses that he/she may have, each must be in succession after a proper divorce for each after a marriage of at least ten years. Because age 70 is the latest retirement age, and because no state recognizes marriage before teenage years, there are no more than 5 successive spousal benefits in ten-year intervals. This spousal '''retirement benefit''' is '''half''' the '''PIA''' of the worker; this is different from the spousal '''survivor benefit''', which is the full PIA. The benefit is the product of the PIA, times one half, times the early-retirement factor if the spouse is younger than normal retirement age. There is no increase for starting spousal benefits '''after''' normal retirement age. This can occur if there is a married couple in which the younger person is the only worker and is more than 5 years younger. Only after the worker applies for retirement benefits may the non-working spouse apply for spousal retirement benefits. 

Note that, since the passage of the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act, in 2000, the spouse and children of a worker who has reached normal retirement age can receive benefits on the worker's record whether the worker is receiving benefits or not.  Thus a worker can delay retirement without affecting spousal and children's benefits.  '''The worker may have to begin receipt of benefits, to allow the spousal/children's benefits to begin, and then subsequently suspend his/her own benefits in order to continue the postponement of benefits in exchange for an increased benefit amount. ''' 

===Widow's benefits===
If a worker covered by Social Security dies, a surviving spouse can receive survivors' benefits. In some instances, survivors' benefits are available even to a divorced spouse. A father or mother with minor or disabled children in his or her care can receive benefits which are not actuarially reduced. The earliest age for a nondisabled widow(er)'s benefit is age 60. The benefit is equal to the worker's full retirement benefit for spouses who are at, or older than, normal retirement age. If the surviving spouse starts benefits before normal retirement age, there is an actuarial reduction.  If the worker earned delayed retirement credits by waiting to start benefits after their normal retirement age, the surviving spouse will have those credits applied to their benefit.  <ref name=SSApub10084>{{cite web

===Children's benefits===
Children of a retired, disabled or deceased worker may receive benefits as a "dependent" or "survivor" if they are under the age of 18, or between 18 and 19 and have not yet graduated from high school, or are over the age of 18 and were disabled before the age of 22.<ref name=SSApub10084>{{cite web

===Disability===

A worker who has worked long enough and recently enough (based on "quarters of coverage" within the recent past) to be covered '''can''' receive disability benefits.  These benefits start after five full calendar months of disability, regardless of his or her age. The eligibility formula requires a certain number of credits (based on earnings) to have been earned overall, and a certain number within the ten years immediately preceding the disability, but with more-lenient provisions for younger workers who become disabled before having had a chance to compile a long earnings history.

The worker must be unable to continue in his or her previous job and unable to adjust to other work, with age, education, and work experience taken into account; furthermore, the disability must be long-term, lasting 12 months, expected to last 12 months, resulting in death, or expected to result in death.<ref name="www.ssa.gov.652"></ref> As with the retirement benefit, the amount of the disability benefit payable depends on the worker's age and record of covered earnings.

Supplemental Security Income (SSI) uses the same disability criteria as the insured social security disability program, but SSI is not based upon insurance coverage. Instead, a system of means-testing is used to determine whether the claimants' income and net worth fall below certain income and asset thresholds.

Severely disabled children may qualify for SSI. Standards for child disability are different from those for adults. 

Disability determination at the Social Security Administration has created the largest system of administrative courts in the United States. Depending on the state of residence, a claimant whose initial application for benefits is denied can request ''reconsideration'' or a ''hearing before an Administrative Law Judge''. Such hearings sometimes involve participation of a vocational expert (VE) or medical expert (ME), both independent, unbiased witnesses, as called upon by the ALJ.

Reconsideration involves a re-examination of the evidence, and the opportunity for a hearing before a (non-Attorney at law) disability hearing officer. The hearing officer then issues a decision in writing, providing justification for his/her finding. If the claimant is denied at the reconsideration stage, (s)he may request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. In some states, SSA has implemented a pilot program that eliminates the reconsideration step and allows claimants to appeal an initial denial directly to an Administrative Law Judge.

'''Social Security''', Synonym für die öffentliche Rentenversicherung der USA. Vollständige Bezeichnung: '''Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)'''.

==Vorbemerkungen==

Das US-amerikanische öffentliche Rentensystem - bekannt als Social Security - ist das bedeutendste System sozialer Absicherung in den USA. Abgesehen von sehr wenigen Ausnahmen ist jeder Arbeitnehmer sowie selbständig tätige Personen beitragspflichtig. Social Security leistet die folgen Zahlungen:
*Altersrente ('''O'''ld '''A'''ge '''I'''nsurance, OAI)
*Behindertenrente ('''D'''isability '''I'''nsurance, DI)
*Witwenrente ('''S'''urvivors '''I'''nsurance, SI)
*Waisenrente ('''S'''urvivors '''I'''nsurance, SI)

Social Security kann daher als Sozialversicherungssystem klassifiziert werden. Arbeitslosigkeits-, Krankheits- und Unfallversicherung sind nicht Bestandteil von Social Security, vielmehr werden diese von anderen Programmen mehr oder weniger umfangreich abgedeckt. Für Personen ab dem 65. Lebensjahr existiert eine umfangreiche Krankenversicherung, Medicare.

==Geschichte==

Social Security wurde als Teil des New Deal von Präsident Franklin D. Roosevelt im Jahre 1935 als öffentliches Rentensystem eingeführt, das im wesentlichen nach dem Umlageverfahren finanziert wird, d. h. die Beiträge der gegenwärtig Beschäftigten finanzieren die Ausgaben für die Beitragsempfänger, ohne dass bemerkenswerte finanzielle Reserven aufgebaut werden.
Zu Beginn war die Beitragspflicht begrenzt auf Berufe im verarbeitenden Gewerbe. Nach dem 2. Weltkrieg expandierte Social Security jedoch sehr schnell und zum Ende der sechziger Jahre war die Beitragspflicht beinahe universal. 
In der Anfangszeit wurde die Höhe der Rentenzahlungen vom Kongress bestimmt. Seit der Mitte der Siebziger Jahr erfolgen die Anpassungen automatisch, um den steigenden Lebenshaltungskosten Rechnung zu tragen.
Im Jahre 1983 kam das öffentliche Rentensystem der USA an den Rande der Zahlungsunfähigkeit. Im Zuge einer Reform wurden die Beitragssätze soweit erhöht, dass das System derzeit enorme Überschüsse erzielt. Diese Überschüsse werden in den sogenannten "trust funds" angesammelt und sollen die finanzielle Überlebensfähigkeit des Rentensystems auf längere Sicht absichern.

== Leistungen der Social Security ==
Das normale Rentenalter unter Social Security ist für Männer und Frauen gleichermaßen 65 bis 67 Jahre, abhängig vom Geburtsjahr. Ab dem 62. Lebensjahr kann die Rente mit entsprechendem Abschlag (ca. 5-6 % pro Jahr) beantragt werden. Entsprechend kann der Rentner seinen Antrag bis zum 70. Lebensjahr aufschieben, um ungefähr den gleichen jährlichen Aufschlag zu beanspruchen. Der Grundanspruch richtet sich nach den Einzahlungen und den Jahren. Einzahlungen für ein Jahr zählen als voll, wenn diese den jeweiligen Prozentsatz der Beitragsbemessungsgrenze für das Jahr erreichen. Eine Mindestbeitragsdauer von effektiv 5 Jahren ist Voraussetzung.

Gleichberechtigung wird in Social Security konsequent angewandt. Welcher der Ehepartner Beiträge zur Social Security geleistet hatte, spielt keine Rolle. Der Hinterbliebene erhält 60% des Betrages, den der Partner erhalten hatte. Der Hinterbliebene muss weder selbst etwas zur Social Security einbezahlt haben noch die amerikanische Bürgerschaft besitzen. Darüber hinaus erhält der Ehepartner, während der Rentner noch lebt, einen Betrag in Höhe von 50 % des Grundanspruchs des Rentenempfängers. Diese Begünstigung wird von der Social Security zusätzlich geleistet. Sie wird fällig, wenn der Begünstigte das Rentenalter erreicht und die Begünstigung beantragt hat. Der Begünstigte muss weder seinen eigenen Anspruch erwirtschaftet haben, noch die amerikanische Bürgerschaft besitzen. Sollte der Ehepartner aufgrund seiner eigenen Beiträge zur Social Security einen selbst erwirtschafteten Anspruch haben, so hat er die Wahl zwischen beiden Ansprüchen. Eine gleichzeitige Inanspruchnahme beider Leistungen ist jedoch nicht zulässig.
