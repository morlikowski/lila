'''Midtown''' est une partie de l'île de Manhattan, dans la ville de New York, États-Unis.

Dans un sens large, il s'agit d'une zone commençant à la 14 rue au sud de l'île, et allant jusqu'à la 59 rue, qui borde le sud de Central Park.

Dans un sens plus restreint, il s'agit seulement d'une partie de cette zone. On entend alors par Midtown un grand centre d'affaires et de commerces particulièrement actif, célèbre pour ses nombreux gratte-ciel. Dans ce cas, Midtown ne commence qu'à la 31, voire à la 42 rue. Son extension est-ouest peut aussi être limitée, non plus par l'Troisième et la Huitième Avenue.  

Quelle que soit sa taille exacte, Midtown est sans conteste la zone commerciale la plus active des  États-Unis. La majorité des gratte-ciel de New York, abritant bureaux, hôtels et appartements sont situés dans ce secteur. Plus de trois millions de travailleurs s'y rendent chaque jour, et le quartier connaît également un afflux considérable de touristes et d'étudiants. Certaines zones, sur la Cinquième Avenue et Times Square, sont une véritable concentration de boutiques en tous genres. 

== Monuments remarquables == 
Dans la zone comprise entre la 42 et la 59 rue se trouvent : le Cathédrale Saint-Patrick, le Rockefeller Center, le Carnegie Hall, le Museum of Modern Art.

Midtown Manhattan is the largest central business district in the United States and is home to the city's tallest and most famous buildings such as the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building.

Midtown, along with "Uptown" and "Downtown", is one of the three major subdivisions of Manhattan (though "Uptown" and "Downtown" can also be used as adjectives or prepositions, and can take on completely different meanings in the other boroughs, whereas the term "Midtown" cannot) and can be understood as those parts of Manhattan in neither of these two other regions - that is, all areas between 14th Street and 59th Street, from the 31st Street to 59th Street between Third and Ninth avenues, about two square miles (this is the area most commonly referred to as "Midtown.") The "Plaza District", a term used by Manhattan real estate professionals to denote the most expensive area of midtown from a commercial real estate perspective, lies between 42nd Street and 59th Street, from Third Avenue to Seventh Avenue, about a square kilometer or half a square mile. 

As New York's largest Sixth Avenue in Midtown holds the headquarters of all four major Madison Avenue the major advertising agencies. It is also a growing center of finance, second in importance within the United States only to Downtown Manhattan's Financial District. Times Square is also the epicenter of American theatre.
