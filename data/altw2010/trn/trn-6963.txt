==Plot summary==

Andy Barclay ( Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) was, in fact, alive. Detective Mike Norris had been threatened into dismissal and feared humiliation; hence why he did not back her up. In an attempt to save the company's reputation, an executive of the company named Mattson (Greg Germann), has the killer doll's body reconstructed. The effort is to prove to the public that nothing was wrong with the line of Good Guy dolls and the Barclays' claims were an isolated incident. The company assumes an employee had tampered with Chucky's voice synthesizer. During Chucky's reconstruction (which is witnessed by Mattson and Mr. Sullivan, the CEO of the company), the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray is resurrected unintentionally. One of the technicians is electrocuted (presumably using his "life energy" to bring Chucky back to life). Disgusted by yet another death linked to the Good Guy doll, Mr. Sullivan (Peter Haskell) tells Mattson to "stick it [the doll] up your ass!". 

Upon Andy's arrival at the Simpson home, he discovers that there is a Good Guy doll named Tommy in his bedroom closet when it falls from the top shelf. Startling and frightening Andy, his foster mother, Joanne Simpson (Jenny Agutter), immediately removes it from his room.

Another foster child, Kyle (Christine Elise), also resides with the Simpson family. She is nearly 18 years old and has grown up in the foster care system. She takes Andy under her wing and mentors him on the trials and tribulations of living in foster homes.

Leaving the toy company that night, Mattson attempts to put Chucky into his trunk. The trunk, being completely full, won't close. As it is raining heavily, he soon gives up and throws Chucky into the backseat of his BMW. The Good Guy Doll executive stops at a liquor store to pick up some vodka for his anniversary. While inside the liquor store, Chucky uses the vehicle's cell phone to call Grace Poole, Andy's social worker. Chucky claims to be Andy's uncle Charles; Ms. Poole informs him that Andy is living with the Simpson family. Chucky then activates the car alarm, forcing Mattson to abruptly depart the liquor store. Chucky uses a toy water pistol and demands Mattson drive him to a parking lot nearby the Simpson home. Chucky uses a jump rope to tie the executive's hands behind the seat and then suffocates him with a plastic bag. During the night, Chucky destroys the Tommy Good Guy doll and buries him underneath the backyard tree swing. 

Phil Simpson (Gerrit Graham) is concerned that he and his wife are not going to be able to care for Andy. Because of the traumatic murders Andy has witnessed, he may need more emotional support than the Simpsons can provide. They discuss sending him back to the agency. Andy overhears the conversation, and begins carrying Chucky (who he thinks is Tommy) around, presumably in an attempt to gain acceptance and stay with the Simpson family.

Wasting no time, Andy awakes one night to find that Chucky has tied him to his bed.  Chucky attempts to transfer his soul into the boy's body. Before he can complete the ritual, he is interrupted by Kyle, who sneaks in the window after a late-night party. Joanne and Phil discover them and assume Kyle had tied Andy up so that he wouldn't tell on her for sneaking out. Andy claims Chucky is alive, but Phil won't listen. Phil angrily throws Chucky into the basement. Which Chucky gets up and finds out he's turning human again by having a bloody nose.

The next day, Chucky hitches a ride on the bottom of the bus and follows Andy to school. At the end of the day, Andy's teacher, Ms. Kettlewell (Beth Grant), is looking over papers and sees profanity on Andy's paper. Andy sees Chucky on the toy shelf, and gasps. Ms. Kettlewell angrily confronts Andy about his paper. She assumes Andy is going to play with the doll as he stares at it. She locks Chucky in the storage closet and demands that Andy put his head down on his desk. Locking Andy in the classroom, she goes to call the Simpsons. Chucky immediately begins shouting for Andy to let him out of the closet. Andy escapes via the classroom window and runs home. Ms. Kettlewell returns a short time later and finds the classroom empty. Hearing banging coming from the storage closet, she naturally assumes that Andy is hiding in it. While searching the closet for Andy, Chucky pops out from behind a rack of coats and kills Ms. Kettlewell by smashing her with a yard-stick.

It is now night time at the Simpson home. Andy goes into the basement with an electric knife determined to kill Chucky. Chucky jumps onto Andy's back from behind some hanging laundry and a struggle ensues. Hearing the commotion, Phil is awakened and goes to the basement to investigate. Chucky hides underneath the stairs. Phil begins walking down the stairs and asks Andy to put down the knife. Chucky trips Phil from beneath the stairs and he falls to his death. 

The police and Grace Poole arrive. Andy is sent back to the orphanage. Kyle, upset about the evening's events, goes outside to smoke a cigarette on the swing. While swinging, she kicks up some dirt and discovers the Tommy doll buried in a shallow grave. Realizing Andy was telling the truth about Chucky, she goes back into the Simpson house only to discover that Joanne's throat had been slashed. Chucky is hiding under the bed and eventually gets the upper hand, putting a knife to Kyle's cheek.
