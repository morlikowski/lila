'''Showtime''' is a subscription television brand used by a number of channels and platforms around the world, but primarily refers to a group of channels in the United States.

==History==
Showtime primarily shows motion pictures as well as some original programming and occasional Viacom, went on the air on HBO. In 1979, Viacom sold 50% of Showtime to TelePrompTer.

In 1982, Westinghouse, who had acquired TelePrompTer the previous year, sold its share of Showtime back to Viacom. In 1983, Viacom and Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment merged Showtime and The Movie Channel to form Showtime Networks, Inc.. 1984 saw the premiere of Showtime's first original movie, ''The Ratings Game'', both starring, and directed by, Danny DeVito. In 1985, Viacom acquired Warner-Amex's cable properties, including their share of Showtime Networks.

In 1990, Showtime ventured into acquiring and premiering independent films directly for the channel, originally as part of its Lolita'', directed by Adrian Lyne. 

In the early 2000s, Showtime launched several additional multiplex channels including '''Showtime Too''' (a pun on its previous name, Showtime 2), '''Showcase''' (formerly Showtime 3), '''Showtime Beyond''' and '''Showtime Extreme'''. Showtime had also launched several channels exclusively for digital cable: '''Showtime Family Zone''', '''Showtime Next''', and '''Showtime Women'''.

Showtime Networks also owns the channels The Movie Channel Xtra and Flix.  In addition, it manages Sundance Channel, which is a joint venture of CBS Corporation, Robert Redford and NBC Universal.  Each multiplex channel offers movies and programs fitting each channel's particular theme. Premiers of popular movies are usually made on the primary channel.

In 2000, Showtime launched the "Showtime Interactive 24.7" channel&mdash;providing DVD-like interaction opportunities to its entertainment offerings.

In the 2000s, Showtime began test marketing a subscription-video-on-demand SVOD system. Now there is a Showtime subscription-video-on-demand channel called Showtime On Demand, which users are able to see episodes of Showtime original series, movies, adult programming and boxing. This channel is only available on digital cable in the US.

Showtime also became one of the first networks to broadcast an HDTV version of its channel, along with Dolby Digital sound.

In 2005, Showtime became a subsidiary of the newly renamed CBS Corporation, after the CBS/Viacom split of that year.

==Branding==
Showtime's launch logo made in 1976 was a circle with a TV screen inside (identical to TV Globo's, but without the circle in the center.) From 1984 to 1990, it was accompanied by a bold "SHOWTIME" script. The TV screen was dropped in 1986 and the circle was dropped in the early 1990s, and the script took over as the primary logo. The current Showtime logo consisting of the network's name still in all caps with the 'SHO' imprinted on a circle was implemented when the network rebranded itself in 1997. The logo which is slightly similar to Cinemax's current logo introduced the same year, is shown most of the time with just the circle 'SHO' (formerly the network's shortened name within TV Guide listings).

Following in the footsteps of Starz, the main Showtime networks brand many of its films with transparent logos of each respective network, to the chagrin of many who would rather see clean screenings of movies with no commercial branding whatsoever. Cinemax also brands films and series with logos, which usually only appear for a few minutes before being removed and reappear later on.

Unlike other premium channels, Showtime has recently begun to air banner advertising for its upcoming shows during movies, original content.

'''Showtime''' is een Amerikaanse betaal-kabel uitzendt. Het is opgericht in 1976 en heeft verschillende kanalen over de wereld, maar zendt voornamelijk uit in de Verenigde Staten. 

==Geschiedenis==
Showtime werd opgericht door satelliet, om zo de rechtstreekse concurrentie aan te gaan met HBO. In 1979 verkocht Viacom Showtime voor 50% aan TelePrompTer.

In 1982 verkocht Westinghouse (die ondertussen TelePrompTer had opgekocht) de aandelen weer aan Viacom. Viacom besloot toen om, samen met Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, het kanaal te laten samen voegen met ''The Movie Channel'', om zo te komen tot '''Showtime Networks, Inc.''' In 1985 kocht Viacom de aandelen van Warner-Amex kabeltelevisie bedrijven, inclusief die van Showtime Networks. In 2005 werd Showtime onderdeel van CBS Corporation, nadat CBS en Viacom uit elkaar gingen.

Sinds het begin van deze eeuw heeft Showtime een aantal dochterkanalen:
''Showtime Too'', ''Showtime'', ''Showtime Beyond'', ''Showtime Extreme'', ''Showtime Family Zone'', ''Showtime Next'' en ''Showtime Women''.

Showtime Networks bezit ook andere kanalen, zoals ''The Movie Channel'', ''The Movie Channel Xtra'' en ''Flix''.  Ook beheert de groep het televisiekanaal dat nieuws en informatie brengt rond Robert Redford’s Sundance Film Festival.

Showtime was ook het eerste station dat kabeltelevisie bracht in HDTV.
