== Yapım ==

===Fikir===
Dizi o zaman için ABC'nin başında bulunan Lloyd Braun'ın Spelling Television'dan Sineklerin Tanrısı romanı ve Yeni Hayat ve  Gilligan's Island filmlerini temel alan bir ilk senaryo istemesiyle gelişmeye başladı. Gadi Pollack diziye ilham olan bazı unsurların ''Myst'' adlı bilgisayar oyunundan alındığını belirtir<ref>"''Lost'': Getting Your Fix," ''Game Informer'' 177 (January 2008): 79.</ref>. ABC Jeff Lieber ile anlaştı. Lieber, ''Nowhere'' başlığı ile pilot bölüm senaryosunu yazdı.<ref></ref> Sonuçtan ve tekrar tekrar yazılan senaryolardan mutsuz olan Braun, Touchstone ile anlaşması olan ve ''Alias'' dizisinin yaratıcısı J.J. Abrams ile yeni bir pilot bölüm yazması için irtibata geçti. Önceleri kararsız olmasına rağmen Abrams dizinin sahip olduğu doğa üstü yönü sayesinde projeye ısındı ve Damon Lindelof'un da işbirliği ile dizinin tarzını ve karakterlerini yarattı.<ref name="DT081405"> </ref>

===Episode format===
Episodes have a distinct structure: following a recap of events relevant to the upcoming narrative, each show begins with a flashbacks and later, twist or cliffhanger, revealed just seconds before a smash cut to black and the title graphic. Others, following a plot resolution, will finish with a reflective closing scene that precedes a simple fade to black, and in particularly tragic or heart-felt closing scenes, the booming noise that accompanies the title graphic will be silenced, amplifying the impact of the event.

===Music===

''Lost'' features incidental music performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra and composed by Michael Giacchino, whose score is orchestral, incorporating several recurring themes for events and characters. Giacchino achieved some of the sounds for the score using unusual instruments, such as striking suspended pieces of the plane's fuselage.<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/podcasts/101323.html Official ''Lost'' Podcast] 9 January 2006.</ref>

On March 21 2006, the record label Varèse Sarabande released the original television soundtrack for ''Lost'''s first season.<ref name="Soundtrack 1">[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EHSVDM ''Lost'': Season 1 Original Soundtrack- Amazon.com]</ref> The soundtrack included select full-length versions of the most popular themes of the season and the main title, which was composed by series creator J.J.

Pop culture songs have been used sparingly in the series, given the mainly orchestral score. When such songs are featured, they usually originate from a diegetic source. Examples are the various songs played on Hurley's portable CD player throughout the first season (until its batteries died in the episode "Joe Purdy's "Washed Away", or the use of the record player in the second season, which included Make Your Own Kind of Music" and Downtown" in the second and third season premieres respectively. In two episodes, Charlie is shown on a street corner playing guitar and singing the Oasis song "Wonderwall". In the third season's finale, Jack is driving down the street listening to Nirvana's "Scentless Apprentice," right before he arrives to the Hoffs/Drawlar Funeral Parlor, and in the parallel scene in the fourth season's finale he arrives listening to "Shambala on two occasions in the van. The only two pop songs that have ever been used without a source (i.e. non-I Do" and "I Shall Not Walk Alone", written by Confidence Man". 

In some international broadcasts, alternate music is used. For instance, in the theme song for season one is "Here I Am" by Chemistry, the theme song for season two is "theme song for season three is "Fire Walk With Me" by Fantômas.

==Cast and characters==

thumb|right|Current main cast from left to right: [[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes|Hugo, Claire, Sawyer, Kate, Jack, Jin, Sun, Juliet, Locke, Sayid, Ben and Desmond. Not pictured: Charlotte, Daniel, Michael, and Miles.]]

Out of the 324 people on board Oceanic Flight 815,<ref>Goddard, Drew (writer) & Vaughan, Brian K. (writer) & Williams, Stephen (director), "Lost'', ABC.  Episode 2, season 4.  Aired on February 7, 2008.</ref> there are 72 initial survivors (71 humans and 1 dog) spread across the three sections of the plane crash. The opening season featured 14 regular speaking roles, making it the second largest cast in a currently-airing American prime time television show behind ''Desperate Housewives''. While a large cast makes ''Lost'' more expensive to produce, the writers benefit from more flexibility in story decisions. According to series executive producer Bryan Burk, "You can have more interactions between characters and create more diverse characters, more back stories, more love triangles."<ref></ref>

The initial season had 14 major roles getting star billing.  Matthew Fox acted as the troubled surgeon and protagonist John Locke.  Michael Dawson, while child actor Malcolm David Kelley acted as his young son, Walt Lloyd.  Ian Somerhalder played Boone Carlyle, chief operating officer of his mother's wedding business and step brother of Shannon.
 
During the first two seasons, some characters were written out to make room for new characters with new stories.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Boone Carlyle was the first major character to be written out, dying near the end of season one. Walt became a guest star after the events of the first season's finale, making rare appearances throughout season two. Shannon's departure eight episodes into season two made way for newcomers Libby, a purported clinical psychologist portrayed by Cynthia Watros. Ana Lucia and Libby were written out of the series toward the end of season two.

In season three, Others." In addition, three new actors joined the regular cast: Nikki Fernandez and Paulo. Eko was written out early in the season, and Nikki and Paulo were written out mid-season in their first flashback episode. Charlie was written out in the third season finale.  

In season four, Michael Dawson, now suicidal and on a desperate redemptive journey to redeem himself from his previous crimes.<ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=entertainment&id=5509852 ABC: Turncoat Michael Returns to ''Lost'' Island], ABC7Chicago.com, Jeremy Davies as Daniel Faraday, a nervous physicist who takes a scientific interest in the island; Ken Leung as Miles Straume, a sarcastic supposed ghost whisperer, and Rebecca Mader as Charlotte Staples Lewis, a hard-headed and determined anthropologist and successful academic — have joined the cast.<ref></ref> Claire, who mysteriously disappears with her dead biological father near the end of the season, will not return as a series regular for the fifth season.<ref></ref> Michael is written out in the fourth season finale.<ref></ref>

Numerous supporting characters have been given expansive and recurring appearances in the progressive storyline. Alex Rousseau (Penelope "Penny" Widmore (Charles Widmore (Others," inhabitants of the island, has featured such characters as Tom aka Mr. Friendly (Goodwin Stanhope (Richard Alpert (Naomi Dorrit (Matthew Abbadon (John Terry) has appeared in multiple flashbacks of various characters, as has Anthony Cooper (Kevin Tighe), Locke's father and the man who conned Sawyer's parents, and many others.  In the fourth season, Kevin Durand plays Martin Keamy, a mercenary hired by Charles Widmore.

===Casting===
Many of the first season roles were a result of the executive producers' liking of various actors. The main character Jack was originally going to die in the pilot, and was hoped to be played by southern accent, so they changed Sawyer to fit Holloway's acting. Yunjin Kim auditioned for Kate, but the producers wrote the character of Sun for her and the character of Jin, portrayed by Daniel Dae Kim, to be her husband. Sayid, played by Naveen Andrews, was also not in the original script. Locke and Michael were written with their actors in mind.
