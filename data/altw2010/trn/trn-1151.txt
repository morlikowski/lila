In Commodities are usually raw materials such as metals and agricultural products, but a commodity can also be anything widely available in the open market.

The verb produce (pr doos' or -dyoos') is from the Latin ''prōdūce(re)'', (to) lead or bring forth. The noun product (prod'kt or-ukt) is "a thing produced by labor or effort".<ref>Random House Dictionary, 1975</ref> Since 1575, the word "product" has referred to anything produced.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=product Etymology of ''product''], etymonline.com.</ref> Since 1695, the word has referred to "thing or things produced". The economic or commercial meaning of product was first used by political economist Adam Smith.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=produce Etymology of ''produce''], etymonline.com.</ref>

In general usage, product may refer to a single item or unit, a group of equivalent products, a grouping of goods or services, or an industrial classification for the goods or services.

==Single unique product==
Product may refer to a unique product, such as a single carton of brand X milk, a single customized interior design, a single piece of lumber, or a single hour of technical support. Serial numbers are used to identify certain unique products. A vehicle identification number identifies a unique motor vehicle. 

The term "defective product" usually refers to a single instance or a few instances of unique products not meeting specifications or standards. Every product is unique in the sense that it cannot be sold to different customers such as customer A and customer B at the same time, or sold twice at the same time to a single customer. An invoice is a business document requesting payment for actual product delivered. Double billing is the error of charging a customer twice for the same unique product.

==Equivalent or interchangeable product==
The specific meaning of generic product names varies over time and location. Some products such as bread, milk, and salt have been pork bellies have traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but due to selective breeding and changes in hog feed, today's pork belly is not exactly equivalent to a 1960s pork belly. Certain products may be considered equivalent or interchangeable for the purposes of trade, record-keeping, and reporting, despite gradual changes in the product or variations among geographical locations. 

The distinction between a new product and a minor modification to an existing product is not always clear. Certain products have a product life cycle in which the supply and demand for the product increases then decreases over time. The demand for certain food products such as bread will tend to increase with population, but the supply and demand for a specific brand of bread may decline over time.<ref>[http://www.agmrc.org/agmrc/business/gettingstarted/prodlifecycle.htm Product Life Cycle illustration], agmrc.org.</ref> In the United States, a patent for a product is recognition that the product is new in a legal sense. "Utility patents may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof; design patents may be granted to anyone who invents a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture; and, plant patents may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers and asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant."<ref>[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/index.html#patent United States Patent and Trademark Office definition of ''patent''], uspto.gov.</ref>
In business an equivalent, interchangeable or fungible product is defined by a company and its customers. A company's inventory is comprised of physical products, or goods, that are usually recorded as counts of equivalent unique products, such as 50 8-oz cans of salsa. The equivalent unique products may be assigned a product code or item code, such that "50 8-oz cans of salsa" is recorded as "50 17766443" on the company's records. If the company carries two brands of 8-oz salsa, it may assign separate item codes to the brands, or it may use a single item code for both brands.

Product numbers in many businesses clearly identify the product by linking to a full description.<ref>[http://gurneys.com/product.asp_Q_pn_E_14328 Gurney's Seed and Nursery Co., product number 14328], gurneys.com. Accessed on 2007-07-01.</ref>

Product identification codes such as mass-produced product.

===Lots or batches===
Lot numbers, batch numbers or control numbers are used in manufacturing to sub-divide equivalent product by its manufacturing batch or run. The publishing page of a book lists the printing run that produced that unique book. Industries such as pharmaceuticals,
food processing, and petroleum use some form of control number to sub-divide equivalent product for product testing or expiration dating. See also shelf life. Two separate lots may vary slightly, but they are not assigned separate product identification codes because the variation does not give them significantly different features or uses as products.

Barcode labels on vaccines in the UK contain a product code but do not currently contain the batch number or expiry date.<ref>[http://www.info.doh.gov.uk/Cvts/VTSPCW.nsf/1aff0ae1ccdd2b3680256eb000511099/c91b304ac997fdc7802572800041d55d/$FILE/feb%20update%20fin.doc UK Department of Health Immunisation Group Informatics Update], info.doh.gov.uk. Retrieved on 2007 June 27.</ref> Inventory records of controlled substances in the United States must include a "batch number or other appropriate identifying number".<ref>"(ii) For each controlled substance in the process of manufacture on the inventory date, the inventory shall include:...(C) The physical form which the substance is to take upon completion of the manufacturing process (e.g., granulations, tablets, capsules, or solutions), identified by the batch number or other appropriate identifying number, and if possible the finished form of the substance (e.g., 10-milligram tablet or 10-milligram concentration per fluid ounce or milliliter) and the number or volume thereof."[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1304/1304_11.htm Section 1304.11 Code of Federal Regulations], deadiversion.usdoj.gov.</ref>

==Product groups==
===Categories===
In its online product catalogue, retailer Sears, Roebuck and Company divides its products into departments, then presents products to shoppers according to (1) function or (2) brand.<ref>[http://www.sears.com Sears online], sears.com.</ref> Each product has a Sears item number and a manufacturer's model number. The departments and product groupings that Sears uses are intended to help customers browse products by function or brand within a traditional department store structure.<ref>When an online Sears customer goes to the "Parts and accessories" section of the website to find parts for a particular Sears item, the "model number" field actually requires a Sears item number, not a manufacturer's model number. This is a typical problem with product codes or item codes that are internally assigned by a company but do not conform to an external standard.</ref> 

===Sizes and colors===
A catalog number, especially for clothing, may group sizes and colors. When ordering the product, the customer specifies size, color and other variables.<ref>[http://www.llbean.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?page=dress-chinos&categoryId=35346&storeId=1&catalogId=1&langId=-1&parentCategory=3511&cat4=6352&shop_method=pp&feat=3511-tn L.L.

example: you walk into a store and see a group of shoes and in that group are sections of different colors of that type of shoe and sizes for that shoe to satisfy your need.

===Product line===
A product line is "a group of products that are closely related, either because they function in a similar manner, are sold to the same customer groups, are marketed through the same types of outlets, or fall within given price ranges."<ref></ref>

Many businesses offer a range of product lines which may be unique to a single organization or may be common across the business's industry. In 2002 the US Census compiled revenue figures for the finance and insurance industry by various product lines such as "accident, health and medical insurance premiums" and "income from secured consumer loans".<ref>[http://www.census.gov/prod/ec02/ec0252slls.pdf "2002 Economic Census, Finance and Insurance"] US Census Bureau, 2002, p.14.</ref> Within the insurance industry, product lines are indicated by the type of risk coverage, such as auto insurance, commercial insurance and life insurance.<ref>[http://dmoz.org/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance/Carriers/ Insurance carrier product lines on dmoz.org]</ref>

===Service types===
==National and international product classifications==
Various classification systems for products have been developed for economic statistical purposes. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) classifies companies by their primary product. The European Union uses a "Classification of Products by Activity" among other product classifications.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=LST_NOM&StrGroupCode=CLASSIFIC&StrLanguageCode=EN Eurostat classifications], ec.europa.eu.</ref> The United Nations also classifies products for international economic activity reporting.<ref>[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=16 United Nations product classifications], unstats.un.org.</ref>

The '''Aspinwall Classification System'''  (Leo Aspinwall, 1958) classifies and rates products based on five variables:
# Replacement rate (How frequently is the product repurchased?)
# Gross margin (How much profit is obtained from each product?)
# Buyer goal adjustment (How flexible are the buyers' purchasing habits with regard to this product?)
# Duration of product satisfaction (How long will the product produce benefits for the user?)
# Duration of buyer search behaviour (How long will consumers shop for the product?)

'''商品'''（しょうひん）とは、経済活動において生産・流通・交換される物財のことである。商品には具体例としてリンゴや衣服などの物のほかに、法律相談や郵便配達などのサービスや、証券などの権利、情報などが含まれる。
販売する物財に主眼を置く場合には、'''商材'''（しょうざい）とも呼ばれる。

== マルクス経済学における商品 ==
マルクス経済学において、商品とは私的な交換を目的とした財・サービスである。交換の対象ではなく、生産者自身によって消費されてしまう財・サービスはそもそも商品とはなっておらず、交換関係の中で商品という存在は成立している。

また商品は、人間のニーズを充足させる性質である「使用価値」と、あらゆる商品と交換可能性を持つ性質である「価値」を持っている。この価値は社会一般的に必要な労働時間によって決められるものであり、生産性が高まれば価値は低下するという性質を持っている。
