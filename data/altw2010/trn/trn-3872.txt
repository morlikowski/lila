Roplių Epidermio viršutinį sluoksnį sudaro negyvos suragėjusios ląstelės. Raginis sluoksnis netolygus, storiausios vietos virtusios raginiais žvynais, gumburėliais, skydeliais. Tokia oda apsaugo nuo mechaninio žalojimo ir kartu lieka elastinga. Šis šarvas dar sustiprėja, kai po raginiais dariniais susiformuoja kaulinės plokštelės (turi krokodilai, vėžliai, kai kurie gyvačių išnaros). Po senuoju raginiu sluoksniu jau būna susiformavęs naujas. Roplių odoje negausios liaukos susijusios su veisimusi. Paminėtinos krokodilų galvos apačioje prie apatinių žandų muskuso liaukos bei porinės analinės liaukos. Driežai turi kelias šlauninių liaukų eiles.

Burnos ertmėje yra daug liaukų (tarp jų ir nuodų), jos stambesnės už varliagyvių. driežų liežuvį gali išmesti toli. Chameleonų liežuvis lipnus ir žaibiškai jį išsviedžia gaudydami vabzdžius. Be to, gyvačių žandų aparato kaulai sujungti taip, kad jos gali labai plačiai išsižioti ir praryti didelį grobį. Krokodilai ir vėžliai turi gomurikaulį, kuriame yra atskiri kvėpavimo takai ir kepenų ir kasos ištekamieji latakai. Žarnynas panašus į varliagyvių, bet jau yra aklosios žarnos užmuomazgos. Žarnynas baigiasi kloaka.

'''Reptiles''' are air-breathing, scales as opposed to hair or feathers. They are membrane. Modern reptiles inhabit every orders''':

* '''gavials, caimans and alligators): 23 species
* '''Sphenodontia''' (tuatara from New Zealand): 2 species
* '''amphisbaenids ("worm-lizards")): approximately 7,900 species
* '''Testudines''' (turtles and tortoises): approximately 300 species

The majority of reptile species are oviparous (egg-laying) although certain species of squamates are capable of giving live birth. This is achieved, either through  viviparity (offspring born without use of calcified eggs).  Many of the viviparous species feed their fetuses through various forms of placenta analogous to those of mammals with some providing initial care for their hatchlings. Extant reptiles range in size from the newly-discovered Jaragua Sphaero, at 1.6 cm (0.6 in), to the Saltwater Crocodile, at up to at least 7 m (23 ft).

==Classification==
===History of classification===
thumb||right|334px|Reptiles are a [[paraphyletic group. The group can be made monophyletic by including the birds (Aves).]]
From the classical standpoint,  reptiles included all the monophyletic, that is, groups should include all descendants of a particular form.  The reptiles as defined above would be paraphyletic, since they exclude both birds and mammals, although these also developed from the original reptile.  Colin Tudge writes:

</ref> }}

The terms "Sauropsida" ("Lizard Faces") and "E.S. Goodrich to distinguish between lizards, birds, and their relatives on one hand (Sauropsida) and mammals and their extinct relatives (Theropsida) on the other. Goodrich supported this division by the nature of the hearts and blood vessels in each group, and other features such as the structure of the forebrain. According to Goodrich, both lineages evolved from an earlier stem group, the Protosauria ("First Lizards") which included some Paleozoic amphibians as well as early reptiles.<ref name="goodrich1916"></ref>

In 1956 D.M.S. Watson observed that the first two groups diverged very early in reptilian history, and so he divided Goodrich's Protosauria  among them.  He also reinterpreted the Sauropsida and Theropsida to exclude birds and mammals respectively. Thus his Sauropsida included Millerosauria, Chelonia (turtles), basal sauropyterygians.<ref name="watson1956"></ref>

This classification supplemented, but was never as popular as, the classification of the reptiles (according to Romer's classic ''Vertebrate Paleontology''<ref name="romer1933">, 3rd ed., 1966.</ref>) into four subclasses according to the positioning of ''temporal fenestrae'', openings in the sides of the skull behind the eyes. Those divisions were:

*''Anapsida'' - no fenestrae
*''Synapsida'' - one low fenestra (no longer considered true reptiles)
*''Euryapsida'' - one high fenestra (now included within Diapsida)
*''Diapsida'' - two fenestrae

All of the above but Synapsida fall under Sauropsida.

==Evolution==
thumb|right|200px|The early reptile ''[[Hylonomus'']]
 
''Hylonomus'' is the oldest-known reptile, and was about 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) long. ''Westlothiana'' has been suggested as the oldest reptile, but is for the moment considered to be more related to amphibians than amniotes. ''Petrolacosaurus'' and ''Mesosaurus'' are other examples. The earliest reptiles were found in the swamp forests of the Carboniferous, but were largely overshadowed by bigger labyrinthodont amphibians such as ''Proterogynrius''. It was only after the small ice age at the end of the Carboniferous that the reptiles grew to big sizes, producing species such as ''Edaphosaurus'' and ''Dimetrodon''.

The first true "reptiles" (Sauropsids) are categorized as Anapsids, having a solid skull with holes only for nose, eyes, spinal cord, etc.  Turtles are believed by some to be surviving Anapsids, as they also share this skull structure; but this point has become contentious lately, with some arguing that turtles reverted to this primitive state in order to improve their armor.  Both sides have strong evidence, and the conflict has yet to be resolved.

Shortly after the first reptiles, two branches split off, one leading to the Anapsids, which did not develop holes in their skulls. The other group, Diapsida, possessed a pair of holes in their skulls behind the eyes, along with a second pair located higher on the skull. The Diapsida split yet again into two lineages, the lepidosaurs (which contain modern snakes, lizards and tuataras, as well as, debatably, the extinct sea reptiles of the Mesozoic) and the archosaurs (today represented by only crocodilians and birds ''under dinosaurs'', but also containing pterosaurs and non-avian dinosaurs).

The earliest, solid-skulled amniotes also gave rise to a separate line, the Synapsida. Synapsids developed a pair of holes in their skulls behind the eyes (similar to the diapsids), which were used to both lighten the skull and increase the space for jaw muscles. The synapsids eventually evolved into mammals, and are often referred to as mammal-like reptiles, though they are not true members of Sauropsida. (A preferable term is "stem-mammals".)

==Systems==
===Circulatory===
thumb|right|Thermographic image of a [[monitor lizard.]]
Most reptiles have a three-chamber atria, one variably-partitioned ventricle, and two aorta that go the the fitness advantage. <ref> {{cite journal |last=Hicks |first=James |year=2002 |title=The Physiological and Evolutionary Significance of 
Cardiovascular Shunting Patterns in Reptiles  |journal=News in Physiological Sciences |volume=17 |pages=241–245}}</ref>

There are some interesting exceptions to the general physiology. For instance, ventricular diastole and completely divides it during ventricular systole. Because of this ridge, some of these squamates are capable of producing ventricular pressure differentials that are equivalent to those seen in mammalian and avian hearts. <ref></ref>

===Respiratory===
All reptiles breathe using lungs. Aquatic squamates the lungs are ventilated almost exclusively by the axial musculature. This is also the same musculature that is used during locomotion. Because of this constraint, most squamates are forced to hold their breath during intense runs. Some, however, have found a way around it. Varanids, and a few other lizard species, employ diaphragm, which separates the pulmonary cavity from the visceral cavity. While not actually capable of movement, it does allow for greater lung inflation, by taking the weight of the viscera off the lungs (Klein et al, 2003). Crocodilians actually have a muscular diaphragm that is analogous to the mammalian diaphragm. The difference is that the muscles for the crocodilian diaphragm pull the pubis (part of the pelvis, which is movable in crocodilians) back, which brings the liver down, thus freeing space for the lungs to expand. This type of diaphragmatic setup has been referred to as the "hepatic piston."

How turtles and tortoises breathe has been the subject of much study. To date, only a few species have been studied thoroughly enough to get an idea of how turtles do it. The results indicate that turtles & tortoises have found a variety of solutions to this problem. The problem is that most turtle shells are rigid and do not allow for the type of expansion and contraction that other amniotes use to ventilate their lungs. Some turtles such as the Indian flapshell (''Lissemys punctata'') have a sheet of muscle that envelopes the lungs. When it contracts, the turtle can exhale. When at rest, the turtle can retract the limbs into the body cavity and force air out of the lungs. When the turtle protracts its limbs, the pressure inside the lungs is reduced, and the turtle can suck air in. Turtle lungs are attached to the inside of the top of the shell (carapace), with the bottom of the lungs attached (via connective tissue) to the rest of the viscera. By using a series of special muscles (roughly equivalent to a diaphragm), turtles are capable of pushing their viscera up and down, resulting in effective respiration, since many of these muscles have attachment points in conjunction with their forelimbs (indeed, many of the muscles expand into the limb pockets during contraction).  Breathing during locomotion has been studied in three species, and they show different patterns. Adult female green sea turtles do not breathe as they crutch along their nesting beaches. They hold their breath during terrestrial locomotion and breathe in bouts as they rest. North American box turtles breathe continuously during locomotion, and the ventilation cycle is not coordinated with the limb movements (Landberg et al., 2003). They are probably using their abdominal muscles to breathe during locomotion. The last species to have been studied is red-eared sliders, which also breathe during locomotion, but they had smaller breaths during locomotion than during small pauses between locomotor bouts, indicating that there may be mechanical interference between the limb movements and the breathing apparatus. Box turtles have also been observed to breathe while completely sealed up inside their shells (ibid).

Most reptiles lack a secondary palate, meaning that they must hold their breath while swallowing. Crocodilians have evolved a bony secondary palate that allows them to continue breathing while remaining submerged (and protect their brains from getting kicked in by struggling prey). Skinks (family Scincidae) also have evolved a bony secondary palate, to varying degrees. Snakes took a different approach and extended their trachea instead. Their tracheal extension sticks out like a fleshy straw, and allows these animals to swallow large prey without suffering from asphyxiation.

===Excretory===
colon to aid in the bladder. Excess salts are also excreted by nasal and lingual salt-glands in some reptiles.

===Nervous===
The reptilian nervous system contains the same basic part of the amphibian brain, but the reptile cerebrum and cerebellum are slightly larger. Most typical sense organs are well developed with certain exceptions most notably the snakes lack of external ears (middle and inner ears are present). All reptilians have advanced visual depth perception compared to other animals.
There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves.[http://www.curator.org/legacyvmnh/weboflife/kingdom/p_chordata/ClassReptilia/reptiles.htm]

===Reproductive===
Most reptiles reproduce sexually, though some are capable of asexual reproduction. All reproductive activity occurs with the cloaca, the single exit/entrance at the base of the tail where waste is also eliminated.  Tuataras lack copulatory organs, so the male and female simply press their cloacas together as the male excretes sperm.<ref>Lutz, Dick (2005), Tuatara: A Living Fossil, Salem, Oregon: DIMI PRESS, ISBN 0-931625-43-2</ref>  Most reptiles, however, have copulatory organs, which are usually retracted or inverted and stored inside the body.  In turtles and crocodilians, the male has a single median penis, while squamates including snakes and lizards possess a pair of hemipenes.
