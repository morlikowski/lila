'''Carlos Cadona''', better known by his stage name '''6025''', was the first American hardcore punk band Dead Kennedys. Due to his short tenure in the band and avoidance of the public eye since, very little is known about him, and he is most well-known for the mysteries surrounding his departure from the band. 
==With Dead Kennedys ==
6025 started off as the drummer for the Dead Kennedys, playing on their first demos. After the demos, the band found a more experienced drummer, Bruce Slesinger. 6025 left, but was invited back as second guitarist.

6025's guitar playing with the band was very minimal and generally shadowed the bassline of Klaus Flouride, with lead guitarist East Bay Ray doing the majority of guitar work. 6025's writing style focused on chromatic, quirky time signature melodies and harmonies, creating polyrhythms against the other instruments. 6025's lyrics were notably different from the rest of the band's repertoire, focusing on strange, nonsensical imagery and a morbid, fatalistic tone as opposed to vocalist/songwriter Jello Biafra's political satire.

He wrote seven songs with the band - "Ill in the Head" and "Forward to Death", both of which appear on the band's debut album ''Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables''; "Short Songs", "Gaslight", and "Straight A's", which appear on the live album ''Live at the Deaf Club''; "Mutations of Today", which appears on ''The 1978 Demos''; and "Religious Vomit", which appears on the EP ''In God We Trust, Inc.''.

He ultimately departed before the recording of any studio albums, but does guest as a second guitarist on the studio recording of "Ill in the Head". Following his departure, the Dead Kennedys auditioned numerous second guitarists and even -- having been inspired by The Screamers -- considered replacing him with a keyboardist. Ultimately, the band decided to remain a four-piece.

It was heavily rumoured that 6025 did not leave of his own accord, but was ousted due to musical differences. According to East Bay Ray, 6025 left the band because he wanted to play prog-rock, and felt the band's style was "too raunchy, too rock". In an interview, Klaus Flouride confirmed that 6025 and Jello Biafra became heavily opposed to the others' song-writing ideas, and after an argument culminating in a near fist-fight, 6025 chose to depart.

== After Dead Kennedys ==
After leaving Dead Kennedys, 6025 is rumored to have briefly played with The Residents before being replaced by Philip "Snakefinger" Lithman. After this, 6025 disappeared completely from the public eye.
