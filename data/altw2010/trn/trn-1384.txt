On désigne par '''Renaissance''' un mouvement architectural qui débute en Italie en réaction à la surcharge de l'architecture gothique. D'abord italienne, elle se transportera rapidement en France puis gagnera une grande partie de l'Europe où elle cohabitera généralement avec l'architecture gothique.

La Renaissance italienne émane d'un désir de retour à l'Antiquité aussi bien grecque que romaine qui se caractérise par l'utilisation de grandes caractéristiques de ses architectures (colonne dorique, colonne ionique, colonne corinthienne). En effet l'époque antique leur apparaît comme étant le point d'apogée de tous les arts, mais ils ne cherchent pas à simplement l'imiter mais à s'en inspirer pour l'égaler, voire la surpasser.

Les artistes de cette époque sont polyvalents et cherchent à obtenir le savoir absolu, aussi bien au niveau de l'écoles philosophiques de la Grèce antique.</ref>...

En France, ce mouvement se transporte sous François Ier, cet art découvert lors des batailles entre la France et l'Italie pousse celui-ci à inviter de nombreux architectes italiens à sa cour. Ces architectes bâtiront de nombreux châteaux en adaptant l'architecture renaissance italienne aux régions pluvieuses de France (ajout de toiture, ...). À partir de 1575 (à peu près) les artistes français se défont de la tutelle italienne et les architectes français réalisent enfin les grands travaux de la ''Renaissance française''.

==Un style renouvelé==

Les architectes de la renaissance repoussent l'architecture gothique et retournent aux formes et proportions de l'architecture romaine antique. Pour cela, les artistes vont à Rome étudier les vestiges des monuments antiques. Ils favorisent alors l'esthétique, l'organisation, l'harmonie et la beauté, plutôt que la technique et la prouesse.

=== Principaux changements ===
thumb|200px|right|La villa Rotonda, Italie, Vicenza, 1567-1570, Villa de Andrea Palladio.

* Réintroduction des proportions, de la symétrie et de la régularité,
* Redécouverte des techniques antiques (la colonne ainsi que le dôme)
* Construction de villas et de places publiques en plus des églises et palais, 
* Abandon du vitrail,
* Raccords à angle droit (les angles obtus ou aigus furent proscrits).

Au sujet de l'urbanisme, la relation église-palais-place est placée au centre de la réflexion; les rues sont également perçues comme un moyen d'afficher son prestige, d'où l'élaboration de façades spécifiques mais également comme un régulateur de flux.

'''Renaissance architecture''' is the architecture of the period between the early 15th and early 17th centuries in different<!---leave this word---> regions of Europe, in which there was a conscious revival and development of certain elements of ancient Greek and Roman thought and material culture. 

The Renaissance style places emphasis on ancient Roman architecture, of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical niches and medieval buildings.  

Developed first in Florence, with Filippo Brunelleschi as one of its innovators, the Renaissance style quickly spread to other Italian cities and then to France, Germany, England, Russia and elsewhere. 

==Historiography== 
The word "Renaissance" derived from the term ''"la rinascita"'' ("rebirth") which first appeared in Giorgio Vasari's ''Vite de' più eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori Italiani'' (The Lives of the Artists, 1550–68). 

Although the term Renaissance was used first by the French historian Jules Michelet, it was given its more lasting definition from the Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt,  whose book, ''Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien'' 1860,<ref>The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, 1860, English translation, by SGC Middlemore, in 2 vols., London, 1878)</ref> was influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance. The folio of measured drawings ''Édifices de Rome moderne; ou, Recueil des palais, maisons, églises, couvents et autres monuments'' (The Buildings of Modern Rome), first published in 1840 by Paul Letarouilly, also played an important part in the revival of interest in this period.<ref>Erwin Panofsky, ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'', (New York: Harper and Row, 1960) </ref> The Renaissance style was recognized by contemporaries in the term ''"all'antica"'', or "in the ancient manner" (of the Romans).

==Principal phases==
Historians often divide the Renaissance in Italy into three phases.<ref>Some architectural histories eg. Sir Banister Fletcher, include Baroque as a phase of Renaissance architecture. Because of its extent, diversity and deviation from the Classical it is not included here and is the subject of a main article.</ref> Whereas art historians might talk of an "Early Renaissance" period, in which they include developments in 14th century painting and sculpture, this is usually not the case in architectural history. The bleak economic conditions of the late 14th century did not produce buildings that are considered to be part of the Renaissance. As a result, the word "Renaissance" among architectural historians usually applies to the period 1400 to ca. 1525, or later in the case of non-Italian Renaissances. 

Historians often use the following designations:
* Renaissance (ca. 1400–1500); also known as the Quattrocento<ref>The Italian translates literally to "fourteen-hundred" and coincides with the English "fifteenth century".</ref> and sometimes Early Renaissance<ref>The ''Early Renaissance'' in architecture is most applicable to developments in Venice, where there was a more fluid development between medieval and Renaissance styles than in Florence. See: John McAndrew ''Venetian Architecture of the Early Renaissance'' (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1980).</ref> 
* High Renaissance (ca.1500–1525)
* Mannerism (ca. 1520–1600)

===Quattrocento===
In the ''Quattrocento'', concepts of architectural order were explored and rules were formulated. (See- Characteristics of Renaissance Architecture, below.) The study of classical antiquity led in particular to the adoption of Classical detail and ornamentation. 

Space, as an element of architecture, was utilised differently to the way it had been in the Basilica di San Lorenzo in Florence by Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446).<ref>Howard Saalman. ''Filippo Brunelleschi: The Buildings''. (London: Zwemmer, 1993).</ref>

===High Renaissance===
During the ''Bramante (1444–1514) who expanded the applicability of classical architecture to contemporary buildings. His San Pietro in Montorio (1503) was directly inspired by circular Roman temples. He was, however, hardly a slave to the classical forms and it was his style that was to dominate Italian architecture in the 16th century.<ref>Arnaldo Bruschi. ''Bramante'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 1977).</ref>

===Mannerism===
During the ''Mannerist'' period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style was Michelangelo (1475–1564), who is credited with inventing the giant order, a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a facade. He used this in his design for the Campidoglio in Rome. 

Prior to the 20th century, the term ''Mannerism'' had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgemental terms.<ref>Arnold Hauser. ''Mannerism: The Crisis of the Renaissance and the Origins of Modern Art''. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,1965).</ref>

===From Renaissance to Baroque===

As the new style of architecture spread out from Italy, most other European countries developed a sort of proto-Renaissance style, before the construction of fully formulated Renaissance buildings. Each country in turn then grafted its own architectural traditions to the new style, so that Renaissance buildings across Europe are diversified by region. 

Within Italy the evolution of Renaissance architecture into Mannerism, with widely diverging tendencies in the work of Michelangelo and Giulio Romano and Andrea Palladio, led to the Baroque style in which the same architectural vocabulary was used for very different rhetoric. 

Outside Italy, Baroque architecture was more widespread and fully developed than the Renaissance style, with significant buildings as far afield as Mexico<ref>Cathedral of Chihuahua, 1725–1826</ref> and the Philippines.<ref>Basilica Minore del Santo Niño, present structure 1735–39</ref> It is the subject of a separate article.

== Characteristics of Renaissance architecture == 
thumb|left|Raphael's plan for St. Peter's Basilica.
The obvious distinguishing features of Classical Roman architecture were adopted by Renaissance architects. However, the forms and purposes of buildings had changed over time. So had the structure of cities. Among the earliest buildings of the reborn Classicism were churches of a type that the Romans had never constructed. Neither were there models for the type of large city dwellings required by wealthy merchants of the 15th century. Conversely, there was no call for enormous sporting fixtures and public bath houses such as the Romans had built. The ancient orders were analysed and reconstructed to serve new purposes.<ref>The list of characteristics below is expanded from a list based on Banister Fletcher. See below</ref>

'''Plan''' 

The plans of Renaissance buildings have a square, symmetrical appearance in which proportions are usually based on a module. Within a church the module is often the width of an aisle. The need to integrate the design of the plan with the façade was introduced as an issue in the work of St. Andrea in Mantua by Alberti. The development of the plan in secular architecture was to take place in the 16th century and culminated with the work of Palladio. 
thumb|Sant'Agostino, Rome, Giacomo di Pietrasanta, 1483

'''Facade'''

Alberti perhaps having some responsibility in its design as well.

Domestic buildings are often surmounted by a cornice. There is a regular repetition of openings on each floor, and the centrally placed door is marked by a feature such as a balcony, or rusticated surround.  An early and much copied prototype was the façade for the Palazzo Rucellai (1446 and 1451) in Florence with its three registers of pilasters 
thumb|left|Classical Orders, engraving from the ''Encyclopédie vol. 18.'' 18th century.

'''Columns and Pilasters''' 

The Roman orders of columns are used:- Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. The orders can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of pilasters. During the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi.

'''Arches'''

Arches are semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental. Arches are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental scale at the St. Andrea in Mantua. 

'''Vaults'''

Vaults do not have ribs. They are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault which is frequently rectangular. The St. Andrea in Mantua.

'''Domes'''
thumb|The Dome of St Peter's Basilica, Rome. photo- Wolgang Stuck, 2004<!---this is an image that speaks for itself! The rest of the info is further down the page--->
The dome is used frequently, both as a very large structural feature that is visible from the exterior, and also as a means of roofing smaller spaces where they are only visible internally. Domes had been used only rarely in the Middle Ages, but after the success of the dome in Brunelleschi’s design for the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore and its use in Bramante’s plan for St. Peter's Basilica (1506) in Rome, the dome became an indispensable element in church architecture and later even for secular architecture, such as Palladio's Villa Rotonda.<ref> A major use of this feature is great dome of the US Capitol Building (begun 1856) in Washington DC and all the subsequent State Capitals buildings in the Renaissance Revival style.</ref> 

'''Ceilings'''

Roofs are fitted with flat or coffered ceilings. They are not left open as in Medieval architecture. They are frequently painted or decorated.

'''Doors''' 

Doors usually have square lintels. They may be set within an arch or surmounted by a triangular or segmental pediment. 
Openings that do not have doors are usually arched and frequently have a large or decorative keystone. 

'''Windows'''

Windows may be paired and set within a semi-circular arch. They may have square lintels and triangular or segmental pediments, which are often used alternately. Emblematic in this respect is the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, begun in 1517. 
thumb|left|Courtyard of Palazzo Strozzi, Florence
In the Mannerist period the “Palladian” arch was employed, using a motif of a high semi-circular topped opening flanked with two lower square-topped openings. Windows are used to bring light into the building and in domestic architecture, to give views. Stained glass, although sometimes present, is not a feature. 

'''Walls'''

External walls are generally of highly-finished quoins. Basements and ground floors were often rusticated, as modeled on the Palazzo Medici Riccardi (1444–1460) in Florence. Internal walls are smoothly plastered and surfaced with white-chalk paint. For more formal spaces, internal surfaces are decorated with frescoes.

'''Details'''

Courses, moldings and all decorative details are carved with great precision. Studying and mastering the details of the ancient Romans was one of the important aspects of Renaissance theory. The different orders each required different sets of details. Some architects were stricter in their use of classical details than others, but there was also a good deal of innovation in solving problems, especially at corners. Moldings stand out around doors and windows rather than being recessed, as in Gothic Architecture. Sculptured figures may be set in niches or placed on plinths. They are not integral to the building as in Medieval architecture.<ref name=BF>Banister Fletcher, ''History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''(first published 1896, current edition 2001, Elsevier Science & Technology ISBN 0750622679).</ref>

== Influences on the development of Renaissance architecture  in Italy == 

Italy of the 15th century, and the city of Florence in particular, was home to the Renaissance. It is in Florence that the new architectural style had its beginning, not slowly evolving in the way that Gothic grew out of Romanesque, but consciously brought to being by particular architects who sought to revive the order of a past "Golden Age". The scholarly approach to the architecture of the ancient coincided with the general revival of learning.  A number of factors were influential in bringing this about.
 
thumb|left|The Romanesque Baptistry of Florence was the object of Brunelleschi's studies of perspective

'''Architectural''' 

Italy had never fully adopted the Gothic style of architecture. Apart from the Gothic in other parts of Europe. Italian architects had always preferred  forms that were clearly defined and structural members that expressed their purpose.<ref name=BF /> 
The presence, particularly in Rome, of architectural remains showing the ordered Classical style provided an inspiration to artists at a time when philosophy was also turning towards the Classical. 

'''Political''' 

In the 15th century, Florence, Venice and Naples extended their power through much of the area that surrounded them, making the movement of artists possible. This enabled Florence to have significant artistic influence in Milan, and through Milan, France. 

In 1377, the return of the Pope from temporal power throughout Italy.<ref name=A.M>Andrew Martindale, ''Man and the Renaissance'', 1966, Paul Hamlyn, ISBN unknown</ref> 

'''Commercial''' 

In the early Renaissance, Venice controlled sea trade over goods from the East.  The large towns of Northern Italy were prosperous through trade with the rest of Europe, Genoa providing a seaport for the goods of France and Spain; Milan and Turin being centers of overland trade, and maintaining substantial metalworking industries. 
Trade brought wool from England to Florence, ideally located on the river for the production of fine cloth, the industry on which its wealth was founded.  By dominating Pisa, Florence gained a seaport, and also maintained dominance of Genoa. 
In this commercial climate, one family in particular turned their attention from trade to the lucrative business of money-lending. The Medici became the chief bankers to the princes of Europe, becoming virtually princes themselves as they did so, by reason of both wealth and influence. 
Along the trade routes, and thus offered some protection by commercial interest, moved not only goods but also artists, scientists and philosophers.<ref name=A.M />

'''Religious''' 

The return of the Pope from Avignon in 1377 and the resultant new emphasis on Rome as the center of Christian spirituality, brought about a boom in the building of churches in Rome such as had not taken place for nearly a thousand years. This commenced in the mid 15th century and gained momentum in the 16th century, reaching its peak in the Baroque period. The construction of the Sistine Chapel with its uniquely important decorations and the entire rebuilding of St Peter's, one of Christendom's most significant churches, was part of this process.<ref name= I.R.>Ilan Rachum, ''The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia'', 1979, Octopus, ISBN 0706408578</ref> 

In wealthy republican Florence, the impetus for church-building was more civic than spiritual. The unfinished state of the enormous cathedral dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary did no honour to the city under her patronage. However, as the technology and finance were found to complete it, the rising dome did credit not only to the Blessed Virgin, its architect and the Church but also the Signoria, the Guilds and the sectors of the city from which the manpower to construct it was drawn. The dome inspired further religious works in Florence.

'''Philosophic''' 

The development of printed books, the rediscovery of ancient writings, the expanding of political and trade contacts and the exploration of the world all increased knowledge and the desire for education.<ref name=BF />

The reading of philosophies that were not based in Christian theology led to the development of Humanism through which it was clear that while God had established and maintained order in the Universe, it was the role of Man to establish and maintain order in Society.<ref> J.R.Hale, ''Renaissance Europe, 1480–1520'', 1971, Fontana ISBN 0006324355</ref> 

'''Civil'''

Some major ecclesiastical building works were also commissioned, not by the church, but by guilds representing the wealth and power of the city. Brunelleschi’s dome at Florence Cathedral, more than any other building belonged to the people of the city because the construction of each of the eight segments was achieved by a different sector of the city.<ref name=BF /><ref name= Gardner />

'''Patronage''' 

As in the Platonic academy of Gonzaga of Mantua, the Farnese in Rome, the Sforzas in Milan&mdash;gathered around them people of learning and talent, promoting the skills and creating employment for the most talented artists and architects of their day.<ref name= Gardner /> 

'''Architectural Theory'''

During the Renaissance, architecture became not only a question of practice, but also a matter for theoretical discussion. Printing played a large role in the dissemination of ideas. 
*The first treatise on architecture was De re aedificatoria (English: On the Art of Building) by Leon Battista Alberti in 1450. It was to some degree dependent on Vitruvius' De architectura, a manuscript of which was discovered in 1414 in a library in Switzerland. ''De re aedificatoria'' in 1485 became the first printed book on architecture. 
*Sebastiano Serlio (1475 – c. 1554) produced the next important text, the first volume of which appeared in Venice in 1537; it was entitled "Regole generali d'architettura [...]" (or "General Rules of Architecture"). It is known as Serlio's "Fourth Book" since it was the fourth in Serlio's original plan of a treatise in seven books. In all, five books were published. 
*In 1570, Andrea Palladio (1508 –1580) published I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura (The Four Books of Architecture) in Venice. This book was widely printed and responsible to a great degree of spreading the ideas of the Renaissance through Europe. All these books were intended to be read and studied not only by architects, but also by patrons.

==Development of Renaissance architecture in Italy - Early Renaissance== 
The leading architects of the Early Renaissance or Quattrocento were Brunelleschi, Michelozzo and Alberti.

===Brunelleschi===
thumb|right|[[Ospedale degli Innocenti in Florence.]]
The person generally credited with bringing about the Renaissance view of architecture is Filippo Brunelleschi, (1377–1446).<ref>Cropplestone, Trewin, ''World Architecture'', 1963, Hamlyn. Page 243</ref> The underlying feature of the work of Brunelleschi was "order". 

In the early 1400s Brunelleschi began to look at the world to see what the rules were that governed ones way of seeing. He observed that the way one sees regular structures such as the Baptistery of Florence and the tiled pavement surrounding it follows a mathematical order—linear perspective. 

The buildings remaining among the ruins of ancient Rome appeared to respect a simple mathematical order in the way that Gothic buildings did not. One incontrovertible rule governed all Ancient Roman architecture—a semi-circular arch is exactly twice as wide as it is high. A fixed proportion with implications of such magnitude occurred nowhere in Gothic architecture. A Gothic pointed arch could be extended upwards or flattened to any proportion that suited the location. Arches of differing angles frequently occurred within the same structure. No set rules of proportion applied. 
thumb|left|The dome of [[Duomo of Florence|Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore.]] 
From the observation of the architecture of Rome came a desire for symmetry and careful proportion in which the form and composition of the building as a whole and all its subsidiary details have fixed relationships, each section in proportion to the next, and the architectural features serving to define exactly what those rules of proportion are.<ref name= W&M>Robert Erich Wolf and Ronald Millen, ''Renaissance and Mannerist Art'', 1968, Harry N. Abrams.</ref> 

'''Cathedral of Florence''' 

Brunelleschi's first major architectural commission was for the enormous brick dome which covers the central space that of Florence's cathedral, designed by Pantheon, a circular temple, now a church. 
thumb|right|The church of San Lorenzo. Photo Stephan Bauer. 
Inside the Pantheon's single-shell dome of brick and stone is coffering which greatly decreases the weight, while maintaining the strength of each individual stone. The vertical partitions of the coffering effectively serve as ribs, although this feature does not dominate visually. At the apex of the Pantheon's dome is an opening, 8 meters across. Brunelleschi was aware that a dome of enormous proportion could in fact be engineered without a keystone. The dome in Florence is supported by the eight large ribs and sixteen more internal ones holding a brick shell, with the bricks arranged in a herringbone manner. Although the techniques employed are different, in practice both domes comprise a thick network of ribs supporting very much lighter and thinner infilling. And both have a large opening at the top.<ref name=BF />

'''San Lorenzo'''

The new architectural philosophy is best demonstrated in the churches of San Lorenzo and Santo Spirito in Florence. Designed by Brunelleschi in about 1425 and 1428 respectively, both have the shape of the Santa Maria degli Angeli of Florence. It is composed of a central octagon surrounded by a circuit of eight smaller chapels.  From this date onwards numerous churches were built in variations of these designs.<ref>Giovanni Fanelli, ''Brunelleschi'', 1980, Becocci editore Firenze</ref>

===Michelozzo===
 
thumb|right|Palazzo Medici Riccardi by Michelozzo.
Cosimo de'Medici in 1444. A decade later he built the Villa Medici at Fiesole. Among his other works for Cosimo are the library at the Convent of San Marco, Florence. He went into exile in Venice for a time with his patron. He was one of the first architects to work in the Renaissance style outside Italy, building a palace at Dubrovnik.<ref name= I.R. />
 
The Palazzo Medici Riccardi is Classical in the details of its pedimented window and recessed doors, but, unlike the works of Brunelleschi and Alberti, there are no ''orders'' of columns in evidence. Instead, Michelozzo has respected the Florentine liking for rusticated stone. He has seemingly created three orders out of the three defined rusticated levels, the whole being surmounted by an enormous Roman-style cornice which juts out over the street by 2.5 meters.<ref name=BF />

===Alberti=== 

Leon Battista Alberti, (1402–1472), was an important Humanist theoretician and designer whose book on architecture ''De re Aedificatoria'' was to have lasting effect. An aspect of Humanism was an emphasis of the anatomy of nature, in particular the human form, a science first studied by the Ancient Greeks. Humanism made man the measure of things. Alberti perceived the architect as a person with great social responsibilities.<ref name= I.R. />

thumb|right|[[Sant'Andrea, Mantua, the facade. Photo- Frode Inge Helland]]
He designed a number of buildings, but unlike Brunelleschi, he did not see himself as a builder in a practical sense and so left the supervision of the work to others. Miraculously, one of his greatest designs, that of the Church of San Francesco in Rimini, a rebuilding of a Gothic structure, which, like Sant'Andrea, was to have a façade reminiscent of a Roman triumphal arch. This was left sadly incomplete.<ref name= I.R. />
 
Sant'Andrea  is an extremely dynamic building both without and within. Its triumphal façade is marked by extreme contrasts. The projection of the order of pilasters that define the architectural elements, but are essentially non-functional, is very shallow. This contrasts with the gaping deeply recessed arch which makes a huge portico before the main door. The size of this arch is in direct contrast to the two low square-topped openings that frame it. The light and shade play dramatically over the surface of the building because of the shallowness of its mouldings and the depth of its porch. In the interior Alberti has dispensed with the traditional nave and aisles. Instead there is a slow and majestic progression of alternating tall arches and low square doorways, repeating the "triumphal arch" motif of the façade.<ref>Joseph Rykwert, ''Leonis Baptiste Alberti'', Architectural Design, Vol 49 No 5–6, Holland St, London</ref> 
thumb|left|250px|Façade of [[Santa Maria Novella, 1456–70.]]
Two of Alberti’s best known buildings are in Florence, the Palazzo Rucellai and at Santa Maria Novella. For the palace, Alberti applied the classical orders of columns to the façade on the three levels, 1446–51. At Santa Maria Novella he was commissioned to finish the decoration of the façade. He completed the design in 1456 but the work was not finished until 1470. 

The lower section of the building had Gothic niches and typical polychrome marble decoration. There was a large ocular window in the end of the nave which had to be taken into account.  Alberti simply respected what was already in place, and the Florentine tradition for polychrome that was well established at the Baptistry of San Giovanni, the most revered building in the city. The decoration, being mainly polychrome marble, is mostly very flat in nature, but a sort of order is established by the regular compartments and the circular motifs which repeat the shape of the round window.<ref name=BF /> For the first time, Alberti linked the lower roofs of the aisles to nave using two large scrolls. These were to become a standard Renaissance device for solving the problem of different roof heights and bridge the space between horizontal and vertical surfaces.<ref name= Pevs>Nikolaus Pevsner, ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Pelican, 1964, ISBN unknown</ref>

==The Spread of the Renaissance in Italy== 
thumb|200px|right|[[Scuola Grande di San Marco, Venice]]
In the fifteenth century the courts of certain other Italian states became centres for spreading of Renaissance philosophy, art and architecture. 

In Gonzaga, Alberti designed two churches, the Basilica of Sant'Andrea and San Sebastiano. 

ducal palace being built there. Ferrara, under the Este, was expanded in the late fifteenth century, with several new palaces being built such as the Palazzo dei Diamanti and Palazzo Schifanoia for Borso d'Este. In Milan, under the Visconti, the Certosa di Pavia was completed, and then later under the Sforza, the Castello Sforzesco was built.<ref name=BF />

In Venice, San Zaccaria received its Renaissance facade at the hands of Antonio Gambello and Mauro Codussi, begun in the 1480s.<ref>Marion Kaminski, ''Art and Architecture of Venice'', 1999, Könemann, ISBN 3829026579</ref> Giovanni Maria Falconetto, the Veronese architect-sculptor, introduced Renaissance architecture to Padua with the Loggia Cornaro in the garden of Alvise Cornaro.
