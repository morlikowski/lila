'''MM - Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine''' est une bande dessinée de Disney, publiée en Italie de mai 1999 à mars 2001, avec en vedette Mickey Mouse qui se mène une enquète dans la ville d'Anderville. Mais cette série est beaucoup plus orientée vers les adultes que les traditionnelles histoires de Mickey à Mickeyville.

Cette série est composée de douze parties et aborde à la manière des séries noires, les aventures de Mickey Mouse dans la métropole chaotique d'Anderville. Anderville est conçu à l'image de New York comme l'est Gotham City, c'est une ville décadente emplie de criminels. Les auteurs ont délibérement isolé Mickey de tous ses amis de Mickeyville et il se retrouve donc seul. Même les ennemis de Mickey ne sont plus les simples Pat Hibulaire et Fantôme noir. Ils sont ici souvent insoupçonnables. Mickey se retrouve fréquemment désorienté et en proie au doute.

==L'histoire==
<!--
Mickey Mouse leaves Mouseton for Anderville, being involved in the case of his missing young friend Sonny Mitchell. To prove his innocence, being mistaken for a criminal, both from Anderville villains and police inspector Jan Clayton, he faces some dangerous situations, running the risk of being killed. He becomes friend with Little Ceaser, a well respected, and somewhat rude, bartender, and with his friendly customers. He eventually proves his innocence but he is forced to stay in Anderville, waiting for furthermore investigations. He finds out that his friend left to him an investigation agency: Mickey Mouse becomes a detective and, during all the series, was involved in very dangerous events, which led him to act in a more violent way than the usual Mickey Mouse.

First number of the series was written by Tito Faraci and illustrated by Giorgio Cavazzano. They created Anderville, through many sketches and decided a specific range of color to use for the stories, preferring the dark and cold tones to the light and warm ones.
MM showed the talent of Francesco Artibani and Tito Faraci, main writers of the series, and was a showcase for the talent of some young, at the time, drawers: Silvio Camboni, Corrado Mastantuono, Paolo Mottura, Marco Palazzi, Alessandro Perina, Claudio Sciarrone, Stefano Turconi, Silvia Ziche and Giuseppe Zironi.

There were also two side stories: one featuring the weird journalist Chester Soup, a comical one, and one called ''Anderville Confidential''.

Though fans were pleased about these new Mickey Mouse stories, reactions from Disney were not so enthusiastic. Modern Mickey Mouse was a character far away distant from that of the 1930s and the 1940s, and main readers of his adventures on ''Topolino'', in Italy, were considered being mostly kids. MM tried to change the classic beloved cliched Mickey Mouse. For that reason, from the second number to the fifth, we see Mickey Mouse watching the end of each episode in a theater screen, as if the stories were movies, with him as the main character, not being an official development of Mickey Mouse. Those reasons, together with the low sales pushed for the premature closing of the series. Fans were disappointed and MM was considered a great experiment which was not given any good chance to survive.  -->

'''MM - Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine''' is a Disney comic, published in Italy from May 1999 to March 2001, about Mickey Mouse and his investigation in the city of Anderville.

The series, a noir story starring Mickey Mouse as the main character, is composed of only twelve parts, and it is regarded by fans as one the best Disney series ever, together with PKNA. It is often called MM or even MMMM and it's set in ''Anderville'', a chaotic metropolis, modelled on the city New York. Anderville is a deceiving city, full of criminals. In this new setting, Mickey Mouse has a hard life, because he has no friends and because the authors wanted to break traditional cliché of his adventures in Mouseton, featured in Italian comic Topolino. Villains are different from Black Pete and even from Phantom Blot, often unsuspected, and even friends act in a rude way toward Mickey Mouse, who often feels disoriented in the big city. 
These stories were directed to a more adult reader, trying to bring to a new life the "''old style Mickey Mouse''" of the 1930s and 1940s stories, written and illustrated by the late Floyd Gottfredson.
