'''Mary II''' (Queen of Queen of Scots (as Mary II) from Protestant, came to the thrones following the James II and VII. Mary reigned jointly with her husband and first cousin, William III and II, who became the sole ruler of both countries upon her death in 1694. Popular histories usually refer to the joint reigns as those of "Supreme Governor. Though she shared the post with her husband, she largely exercised its power alone.

==Early life==
Mary, born at St. James Palace in London  on 30 April 1662, was the eldest daughter of James, Duke of York (the future James II of England) and of his first wife, Lady Anne Hyde.<ref name="EM"></ref>
Mary's uncle was Charles II; her maternal grandfather, Anne survived into adulthood.<ref name="BH"></ref>

The Duke of York converted to Roman Catholicism in 1668 or 1669, but Mary and Anne had a  Protestant upbringing, pursuant to the command of Charles II.<ref name="EMJ"></ref> Mary's mother died in 1671; her father remarried in 1673, taking as his second wife the Catholic Mary of Modena, also known as Mary Beatrice d'Este.<ref name="JH1"></ref>

At the age of fifteen, Lady Mary became betrothed to the Protestant Mary, Princess Royal, and Prince William II of Nassau. At first, Charles II opposed the alliance with a Dutch ruler &mdash; he preferred that Mary marry the heir to the French Throne, the Dauphin Louis &mdash; but later, under pressure from Parliament and with a coalition with the Catholic French no longer politically favourable, he approved the union.<ref name="JP"></ref> Pressured by Parliament, the Duke of York agreed to the marriage, falsely assuming that it would improve his popularity amongst Protestants.<ref name="LE"></ref> The first cousins Mary and William married in London on 4 November 1677; Mary reportedly wept throughout the ceremony.<ref name="EM" />

Mary went to the Netherlands, where she lived as William's consort. Although she was devoted to her husband, the marriage was often unhappy; her three pregnancies ended in miscarriage or stillbirth, and her childlessness would be the greatest source of unhappiness in Mary's life. Her animated and personable nature made her popular with the Dutch people, but her husband was often cold and neglectful,<ref name="ne" /> and long maintained an affair with Elizabeth Villiers, one of Mary's ladies-in-waiting,<ref name="LE" /> though over time he became more relaxed in Mary's company.<ref name="EM" />

==The Glorious Revolution==

Upon the death of Charles II without legitimate issue in 1685, the Duke of York became King as James II in England and Ireland (and as James VII in Scotland). He had a controversial religious policy; his attempt to grant freedom of religion to non-Anglicans was not well-received, as the technique he chose was to annul acts of Parliament by Royal Decree.<ref name="EMJ" /> Several Protestant politicians and noblemen entered into negotiations with Mary's husband as early as 1687. After James took the step of forcing Anglican clergymen to read the James Francis Edward&mdash;in June 1688, for the son would, unlike Mary and Anne, be raised a Roman Catholic. Some charged that the boy was "supposititious", having been secretly smuggled in to the Queen's room in a bed-warming pan as a substitute for her stillborn baby.<ref name="right"></ref> Although there was no evidence to support the allegation, Mary publicly challenged the boy's legitimacy, sending a pointed list of questions to her sister, Anne, regarding the circumstances of the birth.<ref name="maryquery"></ref><!--can't find ref for this:and leading to a breach with her father-->

On 30 June, the Immortal Seven secretly requested William&mdash;then in the Netherlands with Mary&mdash;to come to England with an army.<ref name="GR1"></ref> At first, William was reluctant; he was jealous of his wife's position as the heiress to the English Crown and feared that she would become more powerful than he was. Mary, however, convinced her husband that she did not care for political power, telling him "she would be no more but his wife, and that she would do all that lay in her power to make him King for life".<ref name="neb"></ref>
William agreed to invade and issued a declaration which referred to James' newborn son as the "pretended Prince of Wales". He also gave a list of grievances of the English people and stated that his proposed expedition was for the sole purpose of having "a free and lawful Parliament assembled".<ref name="EM" /> The Dutch army finally landed on 5 November, having been turned back by a storm in October.<ref name="GR1" /> The disaffected English Army and Navy went over to William, and English people's confidence in James stood so low that they did not attempt to save their King.<ref name="RHJ"></ref> On 11 December, the defeated King attempted to flee, but was intercepted. A second attempt at flight, on 23 December, was successful: James escaped to France where he lived in exile until his death.<ref name="EMJ" /> 

Mary was upset by the circumstances surrounding the deposition of her father, but William ordered her to appear cheerful on their triumphant arrival in London. As a result, she was criticised for appearing cold to her father's plight. James, too, wrote a diatribe against her criticising her disloyalty, an action which deeply affected the pious Mary.<ref name="EM" />

In 1689, a Mary I married the Spanish Prince Philip, it was agreed that the latter would take the title of King. But Philip II remained King only during his wife's lifetime, and restrictions were placed on his power. William, however, demanded that he remain King even after his wife's death. Although some prominent statesmen proposed to make her the sole ruler, Mary, remaining loyal to her husband, refused.<ref name="Parl" />

On James Francis Edward (who would have been the heir-apparent under normal circumstances), but to William and Mary as joint Sovereigns. It was, however, provided that "the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in and executed by the said Prince of Orange in the names of the said Prince and Princess during their joint lives."<ref name="Parl" /> The declaration was later extended to exclude not only James and his heirs from the throne, but all Catholics, since "it hath been found by experience that it is inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this Protestant kingdom to be governed by a papist prince".<ref name="RH" />

The Acts of Union in 1707); they accepted on 11 May.<ref name="ne" />

Even after the declaration, there was still substantial support for James in Scotland. The Viscount of Dundee raised an army, and won a convincing victory at Killiecrankie on 27 July. The huge losses suffered by Dundee's troops, coupled with his fatal wounding at the start of the battle, served to remove the only effective resistance to William and the uprising was quickly crushed, suffering a resounding defeat the next month at the Battle of Dunkeld.<ref name="grahameb"></ref><ref name="dundee"></ref>

In December 1689 Parliament passed one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights. This measure &mdash; which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right &mdash; established restrictions on the royal prerogative; it declared, amongst other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with Parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail or inflict cruel or unusual punishments. The Bill of Rights also addressed the question of 
succession to the Throne.<ref name="BOR"></ref>

Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple, to be followed by Mary's sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage.<ref name="BOR" />

From 1690 onwards, William often remained absent from England, at first fighting Jacobites in Ireland. Whilst her husband was away, Mary administered the government of the realm. She proved a firm ruler, ordering the arrest of her own uncle, John Churchill, 1st Earl of Marlborough on similar charges; the dismissal somewhat diminished her popularity and harmed her relationship with her sister Anne (who was strongly influenced by Churchill's wife, Sarah).<ref name="ne" /> Anne appeared at court with Sarah, obviously supporting the disgraced Churchill, which led to Mary angrily demanding that Anne dismiss Sarah and vacate her lodgings. Mary later failed to visit Anne during her pregnancy and relations remained strained until Mary's death.<ref name="EM" />
