==Biography==
===Early life===
David Canary grew up and attended high school in Massillon, Ohio, playing football for the famed Massillon Tigers of Washington High School before earning a football scholarship to the University of Cincinnati, where he trained as a singer and became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.  Soon acting became his goal, following college performances and summer stock shows.
===Career===
After a semi-regular role as a doctor in the prime time serial ''Peyton Place'', Canary first came to prominence in Western series ''Bonanza''.

The year 1967 was very good to Canary and his resume. Canary did the classic western movie ''Hombre'' with Paul Newman and Cameron Mitchell, guest starred in a two-part ''The St. Valentine's Day Massacre''.

A contract dispute that year between Star Trek'' forced ''Herb Solow'', Robert H. Justman and Gene Roddenberry to compile a list of candidates for consideration as replacements for Mr. Spock. As revealed in Solow and Justman's book, ''Star Trek - The Inside Story'', Canary was one of the "A List" candidates. When David Dortort ("Bonanza", "High Chaparral", "The Cowboys", and "Ponderosa" creator/ producer) was looking for a new Ponderosa foreman, he saw Canary in ''Hombre'' and cast him in the role.  Canary left ''Bonanza'' in 1970 after a contract dispute with the show's producers. He would return after co-star Dan Blocker's May 1972 death. Canary said that he loved "Bonanza", except for the on-location Nevada filming in over 100 degree heat.

In Another World''. However, the effort to revive the Steve/Alice/Rachel triangle was largely unsuccessful and Canary left the show in 1983, after the character of Steve Frame was killed off in a car crash.

That same year, he joined the cast of ''Stuart.  He has played the twins since (and as per SAG stipulations, gets paid double for performing two parts).  

Additional daytime television roles have included the part of a cult leader on ''The Doctors'' and a role on ''Search for Tomorrow''.  Other prime time guest appearances include: ''Alias Smith and Jones'', "Hawaii Five-0", ''Remember WENN'', and ''Touched By An Angel''.

He has won five Outstanding Lead Actor', and has been nominated an additional ten times. He has been nominated again in 2008 for a Daytime Emmy for Best Lead Actor.  A  baritone, Canary has performed in such musicals as, "Man of La Mancha", "Sweeny Todd", "Kismet" and "Carousel", as well as performing in dramatic pieces such as "The Seagul", and the one man play "Clarence Darrow". Canary's favorite stage performance was when he did Tennessee Williams' Broadway production of "Clothes for a Summer Hotel" with Geraldine Page.
