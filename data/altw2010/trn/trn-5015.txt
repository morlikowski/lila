'''Pelagius''' (, ; died 737) was the founder of the Kingdom of Asturias, ruling from 718 until his death. He is credited with beginning the ''Reconquista'', the Christian reconquest of the Iberian peninsula from the Moors, insofar as he established an independent Christian state in opposition to Moorish hegemony, but there is no strong evidence that he either intended to resuscitate the old Visigothic kingdom or was motivated by any religious desire. 

The chief sources for Pelagius' life and career are two Latin chronicles produced in the kingdom he founded in the late ninth century. The earlier is the ''Chronica Albeldensia'', written at Albelda towards 881, and preserved in the ''Codex Vigilanus'' with a continuation to 976.<ref name="Arab142">Collins, ''The Arab Conquest of Spain'', 142.</ref> The later is the ''Chronicle of Alfonso III'', which was revised in the early tenth century and preserved in two textual traditions, called the ''Rotense'' and the ''Ad Sebastianum'', which diverge in several key passages.<ref name="Arab142"/> The only likely earlier sources from which these chroniclers could derive information are regnal lists.<ref name="Arab143">Collins, ''The Arab Conquest of Spain'', 143.</ref> 

Pelagius was a Visigoth nobleman, the son of Fafila. The ''Chronica Albeldensia'' states that this Fafila was a ''dux'' of Galicia who was killed by Córdoba, again at the instigation of Wittiza.<ref name="Arab144">Collins, ''The Arab Conquest of Spain'', 144.</ref> Wittiza is also said to have exiled Pelagius from Toledo upon assuming the crown in 702. All of this, however is a late tradition.<ref name="Arab144"/> 

According to the late tradition, Berber governor of ''Iegione'' (either León), became attracted to Pelagius' sister and sent word to Tariq ibn Ziyad, who ordered him to capture Pelagius and send him to Córdoba.<ref name="Arab145">Collins, ''The Arab Conquest of Spain'', 145.</ref> That Munuza's seat was at Gijón or León is sufficient to demonstrate that the Arabs had established their rule in the Asturias and that Pelagius was not therefore the leader of a local resistance to Arab conquest.<ref name="Arab148">Collins, ''The Arab Conquest of Spain'', 148.</ref> Rather, Pelagius may have come to terms with the Arab elite whereby he was permitted to govern locally in the manner of the previous Visigoths, as is known to have occurred between Arab rulers and Visigothic noblemen elswhere, as in the case of Theudimer.<ref name="Arab149">Collins, ''The Arab Conquest of Spain'', 149.</ref> 

At some point Pelagius is said to have rebelled, but for what reasons is unknown and such rebellions by local authorities against higher ups was a common theme in Visigothic Spain. An army was sent against him under the command of Alkama and the Christian bishop of Seville, Oppa. That Alkama was the general and that there was a bishop of Seville named Oppa among his ranks is generally accepted.<ref name="Arab145"/> A battle was fought near Covadonga (''in monte Asevua'' or ''in monte Libana'') and Alkama was killed and Oppa captured.<ref name="Arab145"/> Moorish chronicles of the event describe Pelagius and his small force as "thirty wild donkeys."<ref>[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/historia/textos/medieval/alta_edad_media3.shtml "Extract from C. Sánchez Albornoz and M. Antuña's ''Fuentes de la historia hispano-musulmana del siglo VIII'' featuring a translation of an excerpt from Al Maqqari's ''Nafh al-Tib''"] in the on-line Biblioteca Cervantes (Spanish)</ref> The battle is usually dated to 718 or 719, between the governorships of al-Hurr and as-Sham, though some have dated it as late as 722 and the ''Chronica Albeldensia'' mis-dates it to the 740s. 

After royal election by the local magnates in the Visigothic manner,<ref name="Arab149"/> Pelagius made his capital at Fafila.<ref name="Arab150">Collins, ''The Arab Conquest of Spain'', 150.</ref>
