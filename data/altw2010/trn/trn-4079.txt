'''''Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat''''' is a 2003 1957 book, produced by Mike Myers in the title role of the Cat in the Hat, and Dakota Fanning as Sally. Sally's brother, who is not named in the book, is known in this version as "Conrad" and played by Spencer Breslin. 

While the basic plot of the live-action adaptation of The Cat in the Hat rotates around that of the book, the film filled out its 82 minutes by adding new subplots and characters quite different from those of the original story.

==Mature themes==
The film contains a number of adult themes, such as:
* The Cat begins to explain to the children where babies come from before being cut off by Conrad.
* The Cat sings a song about a cat back home where he was bred who never listened to his mother and was finally taken to a vet and was neutered. He sings the line as "...and they cut off his ba... ba... ba..." and cuts off by saying "Boy!". (In a deleted verse, which is included on the film's soundtrack, the Cat sang about a know-it-all cat who liked to be the "teacher's pet" and sings the line "...it took a ton of TNT to kill the bug up her a..." and cuts off by saying "Ask me...".)
* When the Cat spots the photo of Joan he unfurls it centerfold-style, gets excited saying "hubbata hubbata" and his hat extends. (It is revealed in a deleted scene that the photo of Joan featured her in her underwear.)
* When the Cat cuts his tail off he yells out "SON OF A BI..." before the broadcast is terminated.
* After the Cat unsuccessfully tries to capture Nevins he 'talks' to the hoe he is holding, calling it a "dirty hoe" and then apologizing with "I'm sorry baby, I love you", finally proceeding to lick it.
* The acronym of the Cat's car's former name is S.H.I.T. (Super Hydralic Instantaneous Transporter) which Conrad is about to say before the Cat cuts him off, saying "NO! Quick to the S.L.O.W.!"
* After the bathroom was shown while on Mrs. Kwan, The Cat said at the toilet, "Something like that really burns my a.." Then the last word was cut when the started going down.

== Reception ==
The film was largely panned by Ebert and Roeper.  As a result of the frequent mature themes, the widow of Theodor Geisel (who holds the rights to his work) declared that there are to be no more live-action movies based on the works of Dr. Seuss, arguing that the film has clearly deviated from her late husband's family-friendly work.

Not surprisingly, The Cat in the Hat made a strong showing at the 24th Annual Golden Raspberry Awards, snagging the razzie for Worst Excuse for an Actual Movie. The Cat in the Hat was the first and last film to win in that category.
