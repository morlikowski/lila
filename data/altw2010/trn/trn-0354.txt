'''Gaj Marije''' (lat. ''Gaius Marius'', rođen 157. godine st. e., umro 86. godine st. e.) bio je rimski vojskovođa i državnik koji je sedam puta tokom svoje političke karijere bio biran za rimske vojske tako što je među vojnike primao i građane bez zemlje i uopšte zanemarivao formalno važeći imovinski cenzus, te time što je legije reorganizovao u odvojene kohorte.

==Rana karijera==

Marije, rođen u viteškoj porodici u Scipiona Emilijana kao mladi vojnik te je uz pomoć lukavog političkog oportunizma došao na položaj patricijskom porodicom Julija. Mada je Marije time duboko uvredio porodicu Metela, svoje ranije patrone, Afriku kao legata. Marije je zatim započeo intrige protiv svog zapovednika kako bi se dokopao konzulskog položaja; postao je konzul 107. godine (uglavnom uz pomoć vitezova i narodnih tribuna koji su zastupali interese populara), a odlukom narodne skupštine dobio je komandu u Jugurtinom ratu. U tom se ratu nije pokazao mnogo boljim od Metela, ali 105. godine njegov Jugurtu, pa je tako u zgodan čas obezbedio pobedu Mariju i Rimu.

==Kimbri i Teutonci==

Tokom prethodne decenije na severu se razvila ozbiljna pretnja Italiji. Počev od 125. godine nekoliko rimskih vojnih zapovednika (Marko Flak, na primer) borilo se protiv ligurskih i galskih plemena u južnoj Francuskoj, te je najzad tamo učvrstilo rimsku sferu uticaja: izgrađen je put koji je povezivao Italiju sa Hispanijom, a koji su verovatno obezbeđivale neke vojne postaje. Najzad, osnovana je kolonija u provinciju. Tada su neka germanska plemena, od kojih su glavni bili prokonzul bili su sa svojim vojskama potučeni do nogu kod Oranža. U Rimu je zavladala panika, koju je smirila samo čvrsta akcija drugog konzula, Publija Rutilija Rufa.

U tom je trenutku stigla vest o Marijevom uspehu u Africi, pa je on opet bio oslobođen zakonskih prepreka i ponovo izabran za konzula za 104. godinu. Posle sjajnog [trijumf]a, koji je uzdigao moral Rimljana, on je preuzeo vojsku koju je već pripremio i obučio Ruf. Iz godine u godinu bio je biran za konzula, a germanska su plemena odlagala svoj napad na Italiju. Najzad, 102–101. godine do nogu ih je porazio kod Akva Sekstija, a zatim, sa svojim kolegom Kvintom Katulom, na Raudijskim poljima (blizu delte reke Pad). Bio je nagrađen novim trijumfom i još jednim konzulatom. 

==Vojna reforma==

Tokom svog prvog konzulata Marije je preduzeo jedan korak velike važnosti: svestan već dugo prisutnih teškoća u tradicionalnom sistemu regrutacije, on je ignorisao imovinski cenzus prilikom prikupljanja vojnika, te je tako regrutovao veliki broj dobrovoljaca iz redova onih ljudi koji nisu imali ništa da izgube. Ovo se radikalno rešenje otada stalno koristilo, a obavezna se regrutacija sprovodila samo u vanrednim situacijama (kao što su saveznički i građanski ratovi). Takođe je uvećao važnost legionarske zastave, te je tako otpočeo proces koji je vodio tome da svaka legija ima jedan stalni kolektivni identitet. Istovremeno, Rutilije je uveo vojne vežbe i reformisao izbor viših oficira. Različite taktičke reforme vodile su povećanju važnosti kohorte (desetog dela legije) kao taktičke jedinice i potpunom oslanjanju na nerimske savezničke trupe u lako naoružanoj pešadiji i u konjici. Precizan razvoj ovih reformi nije moguće utvrditi, ali su one kulminirale u mnogo efektnijim vojskama Pompeja i Cezara.

Marijeva afrička vojska nije bila voljna da se upusti u novi rat, pa je Marije više voleo da regrutuje nove vojnike (koje više nije bilo teško naći). Ali, izgleda da ni on sam ni senat nisu bili bilo kakve nikakve odgovornosti prema veteranima. Narodni tribun antioligarhijskim akcijama. Marije je pristao, a velike parcele dodeljene njegovim veteranima (kako Rimljanima tako i romanizacije Afrike. Kada su se završili ratovi s germanskim plemenima, Saturnin se 100. godine ponovo pokazao dobrodošlim saveznikom, pošto je isposlovao da se Marijevi veterani nasele u Galiji. To je za uzgrednu posledicu imalo odlazak Marijevog starog zapovednika i potonjeg neprijatelja, Kvinta Metela, koji je odbio da prizna važnost Saturninovog zakona te je, odabravši mučeništvo, otišao u progonstvo. Ali, ovog je puta Saturnin izvukao visoku cenu. Sa svojom saveznikom, pretorom Gajem Glaucijom, sproveo je zakone koji su mu donosili popularnost među popularima i vitezovima, a zatim je za veterane obezbedio zemlju u Makedoniji i na Siciliji, na isti način kao ranije za Marijeve veterane. Planirao je da se ponovo kandiduje za pretora u 99. godini, dok se Glaucija protivpravno nadmetao za konzulat. Nasilje pa čak i ubistvo slobodno su korišćeni da bi se postigli ti ciljevi.

==Političke intrige==

Marije je sada morao napraviti izbor. Saturnin i Glaucija mogli bi mu obezbediti dalju podršku plebsa i možda vitezova, mada su je takođe mogli prisvojiti i za sebe. Ali, kao spasilac svoje države i šest puta konzul, on se sada nadao da će postati stariji državnik i prvak senata ''(princeps)'', koga će prihvatiti i poštovati oni koji su nekada s visine gledali na njega kao skorojevića. Tom je cilju dugo težio, deleći usluge revoluciju ili tiraniju. Stoga, kada je bio pozvan da spase državu od svojih revolucionarnih saveznika, nije mogao odbiti. Zatvorio ih je s njihovim naoružanim pristalicama i nije sprečio da oni budu linčovani, u punoj Aziju.

Uskoro je nađen neki kompromis i Marije se vratio, ali tokom devedesetih godina on nije igrao neku veću ulogu u političkom životu. Mada je još uvek bio u svom elementu kada su njegovi prijatelji i klijenti bili napadani u sudovima, njegovi nekadašnji aristokratski štićenici našli su sada nove saveznike koji su više obećavali. Sula je bio tipičan: blizak Mariju na početku njegove rane karijere, on je 91. godine preuzeo vodeću ulogu u napadima na Marija, u čemu je (što je značajno) naišao na ogromnu podršku. Oligarhija nije mogla oprostiti Mariju.

==Događaji u Aziji==

U spoljnim prilikama, devedesetim je godinama dominirala Azija, glavni rimski izvor prihoda. Crnog mora te je počeo da prodire i u rimsku sferu uticaja. Marije se ranije susreo s njim i odlučno ga upozorio, što je privremeno urodilo plodom: Mitridat je poštovao rimsku moć. Kada je planirao da osvoji Kapadokiju, u tome ga je sprečio senat koji je naložio Korneliju Suli, tada prokonzulu, da tamo postavi prorimskog kralja 96–95. godine. (Tom prilikom je Sula primio i jedno izaslanstvo iz Partije – što je bio prvi kontakt između te dve sile.) Ali, novu nadu Mitridatu davalo je nezadovoljstvo rimskom vlašću koje se širilo po provinciji Aziji. Provincija je bila neefikasno organizovana posle pripajanja Rimu, a unutrašnja gradska uprava bila je korumpirana, tako da su je uskoro preplavili italski "poslovni ljudi" i rimski skupljači poreza. Kada je senat uvideo opasnost, poslao je 94. godine jednog od najistaknutijih pravnika, Kvinta Muciju Scevolu (konzula 95. godine i velikog pontifika) na misiju bez presedana da reorganizuje Aziju. On je sa sobom poveo Publija Rutilija Rufa – [Rimsko pravo|[pravnika]], stoičkog filozofa i bivšeg konzula – kao višeg magistrata, a posle Scevolinog povratka Rutilije je ostao u Aziji, gde je odlučno sprovodio nove principe koje su zaveli. To je izazvalo ogorčenje poslovnih ljudi, čije je profite Scevola ograničio. Zbog toga je 92. godine bio optužen za "iznuđivanje", te je bio osuđen posle suđenja u kome su rimski publikani i poslovni ljudi beskrupulozno upotrebili svoj uticaj na stalež iz koga su se birale sudije. Ta je osuda otkrila slom sistema koji je zaveo Gaj Grakho: stalež kome je on poverio kontrolu nad senatom sada je držao moć za koju nikome nije odgovarao, sprečavao je uvođenje uređene uprave i ugrožavao rimsku vlast. Razni vodeći senatori bili su najednom uznemiravani suđenjima, pa je pretio politički haos.

Far from being a mere son of the soil, as he'd later have the ignorant believe, Marius was a knight, and though his fortune must originally have been modest by the standards of the Roman aristocracy, it would not have been entirely negligible.

 | quote = When, that is, he was quite young and living in the country, he had caught in his cloak a falling eagle's nest, which had seven young ones in it; at sight of this, his parents were amazed, and made enquiries of the seers, who told them that their son would be most illustrious of men, and was destined to receive the highest command and power seven times.
 }}</ref>  Later, as consul, he decreed that the eagle would be the symbol of the Senate and People of Rome.

In 134 BC, he was serving with the army at Numantia and his good services brought him to the attention of Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus. Whether he arrived with Scipio Aemilianus or was already serving in the demoralized army that Scipio Aemilianus took over at Numantia is not clear. It would seem that even at this early stage in his army career, Marius had ambitions for a political career in Rome. He ran for election as one of the twenty-four special military tribunes of the first four legions who were elected (the rest were appointed by the magistrate who raised the legion). Sallust tells us that he was unknown by sight to the electors but was returned by all the tribes on the basis of his accomplishments.

We next learn that he ran for the quaestorship after losing an election for local office in Arpinum. This is hard to interpret. The military tribunate shows that he was already interested in Roman politics before the quaestorship. Perhaps he simply ran for local office as a means of gaining support back home, and lost to some other local worthy. Nothing is known of his actions while quaestor.

In plebian tribune for the following year. He won with the support of Quintus Caecilius Metellus (later known as Metellus Numidicus), who was an inherited ''patronus''. The Metelli, while neither ancient nor patrician, were one of the most powerful families in Rome at this time. During his tribunate, Marius pursued a populares line. He passed a law that restricted the interference of the wealthy in elections. In the 130s voting by ballot had been introduced in elections for choosing magistrates, passing laws and deciding legal cases, replacing the earlier system of oral voting. The wealthy continued to try to influence the voting by inspecting ballots and Marius passed a law narrowing the passages down which voters passed to cast their votes in order to prevent outsiders from harassing the electors. In the passage of this law, Marius alienated the Metelli, who opposed it.

Soon thereafter, Marius ran for the aedileship and lost.  This loss was at least in part due to the enmity of the Metelli.<ref name="Hazel"> {{cite book

 }}</ref> In 116 BC he barely won election as praetor for the following year (presumably coming in sixth) and was promptly accused of ambitus (electoral corruption). He barely won acquittal on this charge, and spent an uneventful year as praetor in Rome (as Urban Praetor, Peregrine Praetor or President of the extortion court). In 114 BC, Marius' imperium was prorogued and he was sent to govern Lusitania, where he engaged in some sort of minor military operation. During this period in Roman history governors seem regularly to have served two years in Hispania, so he was probably replaced in 113 BC. 

He received no triumph on his return and did not apparently run for the Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar. The Julii Caesares were a patrician family, but at this period seem to have found it hard to advance above the praetorship. (Only once in the second century &ndash; in 157 BC &ndash; did a member of the family become consul.) To judge by this marriage, Marius had apparently achieved some substantial political influence by this point.

===Legate to Metellus===

The Marii were the inherited clients of the Caecilii Metelli and a Caecilius Metellus had aided Marius' campaign for the tribunate. Although he seems to have had a break with the Metelli as a result of the laws he passed while tribune, the rupture was not permanent, since in 109 BC Quintus Caecilius Metellus took Marius with him as his legate on his campaign against Senate, but men appointed as legates by the Senate were used by generals as subordinate commanders, usually becoming the general's most trusted lieutenant. Hence, Metellus had to have asked the Senate to appoint Marius as legate to allow him to serve as Metellus' subordinate. In Sallust's long account of Metellus' campaign no other legates are mentioned, so it is assumed that Marius was Metellus's senior subordinate and right-hand man. Thus Metellus was using Marius' military experience, while Marius was strengthening his position to run for the consulship. The rupture in 119 BC may have been exaggerated after the fact in light of his later and much more serious disagreement with Metellus about Numidia.

===Run for the consulship===

By 108 BC, Marius conceived the desire to run for the consulship. Despite lack of approval from Metellus (brought on by Marius' status as a novus homo) who instead advised Marius to wait and run with Metellus' son (who was only twenty, which would signify a campaign 20 years in the future) Marius began to campaign for the consulship.  Sallust claims that this was catalyzed, in part, by a fortune-teller who "told him that great and wonderful things were presaged to him that he might therefore pursue whatever designs he had formed trusting to the gods for success, and that he might try fortune as often as he pleased for that all his undertakings would prosper."<ref name="Sallust, Bellum Iugurthinum"></ref>  Following this meeting, Marius spent the summer ingratiating himself with the troops by relaxing military discipline and with the Italian traders by claiming that he could capture Jugurtha in a few days with half Metellus' troops. Both groups wrote home in praise of him, suggesting that he could end the war quickly unlike Metellus, who was pursuing a policy of methodically subduing the countryside. Eventually Metellus gave in, realizing that it was counterproductive to have a resentful subordinate.

Under the circumstances it is not difficult to understand how Marius was triumphantly elected consul later that year, for 107 BC. He was campaigning against Metellus's apparent lack of swift action against Jugurtha. Given the repeated military debacles from 113 BC to 109 BC and the accusations that the oligarchy was open to flagrant bribery, it is not at all surprising that the virtuous new man who had worked with difficulty up the ladder of offices was elected as an alternative to the inept or corrupt nobility. The Senate had a trick up its sleeve, however. In accordance with the provisions of the ''Lex Sempronia'' on Consular provinces, which dictated that the Senate in a given year was to determine the Consular provinces for the next year at the end of year before the elections, the Senate decided not to make the war against Jugurtha one of the provinces and to prorogue Metellus in Numidia. Marius got around this through a ploy that had been used in 131 BC. In that year there was a dispute as to who should command the war against Aristonicus in Asia, and a tribune had passed a law authorizing an election to select the commander (there was precedent for this procedure from the Second Punic War). A similar law was passed in 108 BC and Marius was voted the command by the People in this special election. Metellus shed bitter tears when he learned of the decision. Upon returning home, he avoided meeting Marius, and was granted a Triumph and the ''agnomen'' Numidicus (conqueror of Numidia).

===Recruitment===

thumb|Marius.

The most dramatic and influential changes Marius made to the Roman army were named the Marian Reforms. In 107 BC, shortly after being elected as Consul, Marius, fearing Barbarian invasion, saw the dire need for an increase in troop numbers. Until this time, the standard requirements to become a Roman soldier were very strict. To be considered a soldier in the service of the republic, an individual had to be a member of the 5th Census Class or higher and own property worth over 3000 sesterces in value. Furthermore, soldiers were required to provide their own arms and uniform for combat. Marius relaxed the recruitment policies by removing the necessity to own land, and allowed all Roman citizens entry, regardless of social class (Plutarch, The Life of Marius). The benefits to the army were numerous, with the disenfranchised, unemployed masses enlisting for military service alongside the more fortunate citizens. Poorer citizens were drawn to life-long service, as they were rewarded with the prospect of settlement in conquered land. This also 'Romanized' the population in newly subjugated provinces, thus reducing unrest and lowering the chance of revolt against the Roman Empire. The new Roman army, its numbers vastly bolstered by lower class citizens whose future was tied to their permanent career, was always able to provide reserves in times of disaster. In addition, the growth of the army ensured continued military success due to the high number of fresh soldiers available for each campaign. Even though the army increased in size considerably, Marius also sought to improve organization among his troops.

Marius needed more troops, and to this effect he made a change in procedure used for recruiting troops, probably unaware of the momentous implications of this change. All of the sesterces of property, and already in 109 BC the consuls had had to seek suspension of Sulla would use it against the Senate and Marius.

===War in Numidia===
Marius found that it wasn't as easy to end the war as he had claimed. He arrived comparatively late in 107 BC and in that year and the next he forced Jugurtha to the south and west toward Mauretania. Marius' quaestor in 107 BC had been Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix, the son of a patrician family that had fallen on hard times. Marius was supposedly unhappy at receiving the dissolute youth as his subordinate, but Sulla proved a competent military leader. By 105 the king of Mauretania, Bocchus, who was also Jugurtha's father-in-law and reluctant ally, was worried about the approaching Romans. After receiving word that an accommodation with them was possible, Bocchus insisted that Sulla make the hazardous journey to his capital, where Sulla induced Bocchus to betray Jugurtha, who was duly handed over to Sulla, thus ending the war. Since Marius held the imperium and Sulla was acting as his subordinate, the honor of capturing Jugurtha belonged strictly to Marius, but Sulla had clearly been immediately responsible and had a signet ring made for himself commemorating the event. Though it seems not to have mattered now, Sulla would later claim that the credit for ending the war was his. Meanwhile, Marius was the hero of the hour, and his services would be needed in another emergency.

===Cimbri and Teutones===
The arrival of the Cimbri in Gaul in 109 BC and their complete defeat of Marcus Junius Silanus had resulted in unrest among the Celtic tribes recently conquered by the Romans in southern Gaul. In 107 the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus was completely defeated by the Tigurine clan, and the senior surviving officer (Gaius Popillius Laenas, son of the consul of 132) had saved what was left only by surrendering half the baggage and suffering the humiliation of having his army "march under the yoke." The next year (106 BC) another consul, Quintus Servilius Caepio, marched to Gaul and captured the disloyal community of ''Tolosa'' (Toulouse), where a huge sum of money (the Gold of Tolosa), was taken from shrines. The larger part of it mysteriously vanished when being transported to ''Massilia'' (Marseille). Caepio was prorogued into the next year, when one of the new consuls, Gnaeus Mallius Maximus, also operated in southern Gaul. Mallius was a new man like Marius, and he and the noble Caepio found it impossible to co-operate.

The Cimbri and the Rhône, and while Caepio was on the west bank he refused to come to the aid of Mallius on the left. Eventually the Senate got Caepio's reluctant agreement to co-operate, but even when he crossed the river to help the threatened Mallius, he refused to join forces and kept his own at a fair distance. First the Germans routed Caepio and then destroyed Mallius's army on Arausio. Since the Romans fought with the river at their back, flight was not possible and reportedly 80,000 were killed. The losses in the preceding decade had been bad enough, but this defeat, apparently caused by the arrogance of the nobility and its refusal to co-operate with talented non-nobles, was the last straw. Not only had huge numbers of Romans lost their lives but Italy itself was now exposed to invasion from barbarian hordes. The failure to deal with this threat marked the start of a period when dissatisfaction with the oligarchy (and thus, conflict between the ''optimates'' and the ''populares'') was becoming increasingly, and dangerously, bitter.<ref name="Shuckburgh"> {{cite book

===As consul===
thumb|Gaius Marius
In late 105 BC Marius was elected consul again while still in Africa. Election ''in absentia'' was unusual enough, but at some time after 152 BC a law had been passed dictating a ten-year interval between consulships, and there is even some evidence to indicate that by 135 BC a law had been passed that prohibited second consulships altogether. Nonetheless by this time news of a new advancing tribe known as the Cimbri had reached Rome and in the emergency Marius was again chosen consul. The law was repealed, as Marius was then elected to an unprecedented five successive consulships (104 BC–100 BC). He returned to Rome by January 1, 104 BC, when he celebrated his triumph over Jugurtha, who was first led in the procession, then killed in the public prison. 

The Cimbri conveniently marched into Hispania and the Teutoni milled around in northern Gaul, leaving Marius to prepare his army. One of his legates was his old quaestor, Sulla, which shows that at this time there was no ill-will between them. In 104 BC, Marius was returned as consul again for 103 BC. Though he could have continued to operate as proconsul, it seems that the position as consul would make his position as commander unassailable and avoid any problems with the consuls if he was only a proconsul. Marius seems to have been able to get exactly what he wanted and it even seems that his support determined whom the People would elect as his colleagues (his choice was apparently determined on the basis of their malleability). In 103 BC, the Germans still did not emerge from Hispania, and conveniently Marius's colleague (L. Aurelius Orestes, son of C. Gracchus's commander in Sardinia in 126 BC–124 BC) died, so Marius had to return to Rome to oversee the elections, being re-elected for 102 BC.

===Showdown with the Germanic tribes===

In 102 BC the Cimbri returned from Hispania into Gaul and together with the Teutones decided to invade Italy. The Teutones were to head south and advance toward Italy along the Mediterranean coast; the Cimbri were to attempt to cross the Alps into Italy from the northwest by the Brenner Pass; and the Tigurini (the allied Celtic tribe who had defeated Longinus in 107) were to cross the Alps from the northeast. This decision proved fatally flawed. The Germanic soldiers divided their forces, making each contingent manageable, and the Romans could use their shorter lines of communication to concentrate their forces at will.

First, Marius had to deal with the Teutones, who were in the province of Narbonensis marching toward the Alps. He refused to give them a battle where they wanted, and withdrew to attacked the Roman position without waiting for reinforcements and 30,000 were killed. Marius then hid 3,000 troops in ambush, so when the main Germanic contingent finally attacked, the hidden Roman troops could fall on them from behind. In the ensuing defeat, the Teutones were completely annihilated, to the number of something over 100,000.

Marius's colleague battle was fought at Vercellae in Cisalpine Gaul. Once again, Roman discipline overcame a larger barbarian force. At least 65,000 were killed (perhaps as many as 100,000 again) and all the remainder enslaved. The Tigurini gave up their efforts to enter Italy from the northeast and went home. Catulus and Marius celebrated a joint Triumph, but in popular thinking all the credit went to Marius. Catulus became alienated from Marius and would later become one of his chief opponents. As a sort of reward (the danger was now gone) Marius was returned as consul for 100 BC. This year would not go at all well for Marius.

===Sixth consulship===
