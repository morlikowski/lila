'''''Alive in Studio A''''' is a heavy metal album released in 1995 (see 1995 in music) by Bruce Dickinson.

The album does not include new songs but instead re-recordings of songs from Bruce's first two solo-albums with his new band line-up. According to the booklet included with the 2005 re-release Alive In Studio A was originally meant as a live session to be played on a US radio station however this never took place. The second CD is composed of live-recordings at the Marquee Club from the Tattooed Millionaire and Balls To Picasso albums with his new band.

The idea was for a low key release of these double albums and according to the booklet in the re-release Bruce Dickinson was less than pleased when the record company tried to pass them off as new material.
