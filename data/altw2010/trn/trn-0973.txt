==Life==
Born Wang Zhongfu in 1113, Wang Chongyang grew up in a wealthy family and received a classical education as well as training in the martial arts. 

According to tradition, in the summer of 1159 when he was 48 years old, he met two Taoist immortals in a pub, Zhongli Quan and Lü Dongbin, who provided him with training in secret Taoist rituals. He changed his name to Zhe and adopted the Taoist name Chongyang.

In 1160 he met one of the immortals again who provided him with five written instructions, the "''Ganshui xianyuan lu.''" According to tradition those written instructions included the names of two men who would later become his disciples, Ma Yu and Tan Chuduan. In a state of delirium, Wang Chongyang then dug himself a grave near Mount Zhongnan that he called the "Tomb of the Living Dead," and lived in it for three years.

At the end of the three years, Wang Chongyang filled in the grave and built a hut on top of it, called "Complete Perfection Hut." He lived in the hut for another four years, continuing his Taoist studies and teaching others. During that time, he met Tan Chuduan who became Wang's disciple after Wang cured Tan's illness. Qiu Chuji and Tan traveled around the local towns and villages with Wang as he founded five Taoist congregations. Later, Wang Chongyang's teachings were referred to the "Teachings of the Complete Perfection" (after the hut) and his branch of Taoism became known as the Quanzhen ("Complete Perfection") school.

In 1167, Wang Chongyang burned down the hut, dancing and chanting. He then traveled east to Shandong where he met Ma Yu and Ma's wife Sun Bu'er who also became his disciples. He ultimately collected seven disciples who were later known as either The Seven Masters of Quanzhen or The Seven Elders of Quanzhen. They are also sometimes called the Seven Immortals or Seven Perfected Beings.

==Writings==
Wang Chongyang was the author of many poems of Taoist instruction. According to legend, Liu Chuxuan became a follower of Wang Chongyang after seeing one of Wang's poems on a wall.

Wang Chongyang's writings include:
*"An Anthology of Complete Perfection by Chongyang" (''Chongyang quanzhen ji'')
*"Chongyang's Anthology on Teaching Transformation" (''Chongyang jiaohua ji'')
*"Chongyang's Anthology of the Ten Transformations by Dividing Pears" (''Chongyang fenli shihua ji'') (The phrase "to divide a pear" is a pun for "to separate," these were writings intended to convince Ma Yu and Sun Bu'er to separate in order to better cultivate the Dao.)

==Disciples==
Particularly notable among Wang Chongyang's seven disciples were Sun Bu'er, and Qiu Chuji. Sun Bu'er is now one of the most important female Taoist role-models. Her husband, Ma Yu, was another of the seven disciples. He eventually succeeded Wang Chongyang as the leader of the Quanzhen sect.

Qiu Chuji gained the favor of Genghis Khan and founded the famous White Cloud Monastery in Beijing. Genghis Khan granted tax-exempt status to all Quanzhen monasteries and put Qiu Chuji in charge of all religions in China. The strong start this provided helped the Quanzhen school of Taoism to flourish, and it is still strong today.

Each of the seven disciples founded his or her own lineage of Quanzhen Taoism. They are as follows:
# Ma Yu (馬鈺) founded the Yuxian lineage (Meeting the Immortals)
# Tan Chuduan (譚處端) founded the Nanwu lineage (Southern Void)
# Liu Chuxuan (劉處玄) founded the Suishan lineage (Mount Sui)
# Qiu Chuji (丘處機) founded the Longmen lineage (Dragon Gate)
# Wang Chuyi (王處一) founded the Yushan lineage (Mount Yu)
# Hao Datong (郝大通) founded the Huashan lineage (Mount Hua)
# Sun Bu'er (孙不二) founded the Qingjing lineage (Clarity and Stillness)

===Life in the fiction===
Wang Chongyang in the world of Jinyong was an extraordinary man. He first appeared in Jinyong's novel, The Legend of the Condor Heroes as a patriotic Taoist loyal to Song Dynasty. His story was later told by one of his prominent disciples, Qiu Chuji in the sequel to the novel entitled ''The Return of the Condor Heroes''.

====The Battle for Song Dynasty====
In his younger years, he assembled an army of righteous, heroic men against the Jin rule. However, he could not overcome the strong and powerful Jurchen army and was defeated many times and in the end he gave up this dream of his.

====The retreat====
Wang Chongyang later retreated to an ancient tomb in Mount Zhongnan where he resided for many years contemplating on his mistakes and meditating. He refused to share the same sky with the Jurchens and made a vow never to step out of the tomb. Eventually, many friends came to urge Wang Chongyang to come out of the tomb because they considered him a hero and the Jins (Jurchens) were still attacking the Song. 

The Emperor of the Jurchen Empire still saw Wang Chongyang as a threat even when his army was gone. So, he sent more than ten martial arts experts to find the ancient tomb and kill Wang Chongyang. However, all of those martial arts experts were inferior to Wang Chongyang and therefore all defeated and or killed by him.

After the death of that emperor the new emperor did not know of Wang Chongyang and did not see him as a threat. And so, it seemed that for a while, Wang Chongyang was forgotten by the world of Jiang Hu.

====Breaking the vow====
It was Lin Chaoying who forced him out of the tomb in the end. Wang Chongyang had met Lin Chaoying earlier in his life and they were very close to each other. She was the only person with whom he felt a certain affinity because of her high skills in kung fu that could rival his own. During the war with the Jurchens, they exchanged correspondence. 

Lin Chaoying stood outside Wang's tomb and cursed him for days until finally he stepped out of the tomb to confront her. But when he stood outside, Lin Chaoying laughed and said that he does not have to go back into the tomb anymore because he has already broken his vow by stepping out of the tomb.

From then on, Lin Chaoying and Wang Chongyang roamed Jiang Hu, the realm of martial arts together. They would often train martial arts together and developed their skills to a higher level. Each fell in love with the other but their pride would not let them share their feelings.
