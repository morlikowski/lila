'''William Francis Buckley''' (CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

==Early life and career==
William Francis Buckley was born in MP and served in that capacity for two years, but then attended Officers Candidate School and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in Armor. He continued his military education at the Engineer Officer's Course at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, the Advanced Armor Officer's Course at Fort Knox, Kentucky, and the Intelligence School at Oberammergau, Germany.<ref name=Arlington>[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wbuckley.htm William Francis Buckley, Lieutenant Colonel, United States Army Assassinated CIA Station Chief], Arlington National Cemetery Website, (2006-04-23). Retrieved on 2008-07-13/</ref>

During the Korean War, Buckley served as a company commander with the 1st Cavalry Division. Next, he returned to Boston University and completed his studies, graduating with a degree in Political Science. It was during this time that Buckley began his first employment with the Central Intelligence Agency, from 1955 to 1957. He was also employed as a librarian in the Concord, Winchester and Lexington public libraries. In 1960, Buckley joined the 320th Special Forces Detachment which became the 11th Special Forces Group and attended both Basic Airborne and the Special Forces Officers Course. He was assigned as an A- Detachment Commander and later as a B-Detachment Commander. Colonel Buckley served in Vietnam with the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, or MACV, as a Senior Advisor to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.<ref name=Arlington/>

==Career at the CIA==
In 1965 (or 1963, according to one source), Buckley rejoined the CIA. He may have been recruited by Ted Shackley, joining his Secret Team that had been involved with Thomas Clines, Carl Jenkins, Raphael Quintero, Felix Rodriguez  and Luis Posada Carriles, in the CIA “assassination” program. Leslie Cockburn pointed out in her book, Out of Control (1987), that Buckley had had to approve CIA assassinations undertaken by the Shackley organizations. In his book, Prelude to Terror (2005) Joseph Trento claims that Buckley was "one of Shackley's oldest and dearest friends."<ref name=Arlington/>

Buckley may have been working for the CIA while in Mexico in 1963, but this is unconfirmed. His CIA employment kept him in Vietnam from 1965 to 1970, and he was promoted in his military capacity to Lieutenant Colonel in May 1969. After leaving Vietnam, he served in Zaire (1970-1972), Cambodia (1972), Egypt (1972-1978), and Pakistan (1978-1979). It is believed he worked with William Casey in the secret negotiations that had taken place with the Iranians on behalf of Ronald Reagan during the 1980 presidential elections. Other sources claim that in 1980 he was put in charge to monitor the safety of the Egyptian President Anwar Al Sadat, who was killed the next year.

In 1983, Buckley succeeded Ken Haas as the Beirut Station Chief/Political Officer at the U.S. Embassy, but was kidnapped by the Islamist group Hezbollah on March 16, 1984. Hezbollah was closely allied to Iran. William Casey, who was by then the Director of Central Intelligence, asked Ted Shackley for help in securing Buckley’s release.<ref name=Spartacus>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKbuckleyWF.htm William Francis Buckley], Spartacus Educational. Retrieved on 2008-07-13.</ref>

Three weeks after Buckley’s abduction, President Ronald Reagan signed the National Security Decision Directive 138. This directive was drafted by Iran-Contra deal, which culminated in the exchange of missiles for the release of hostages.<ref name=Spartacus/>

On November 22, 1985, Ted Shackley, Buckley's friend and recruiter, traveled to Hamburg, where he met General Manucher Hashemi, the former head of SAVAK’s counterintelligence division at the Atlantic Hotel. Also at the meeting on 22nd November was Manucher Ghorbanifar. According to the report of this meeting that Shackley sent to the CIA, Ghorbanifar had “fantastic” contacts with Iran, but the CIA had designated him one year earlier as a "fabricator".<ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB210/index.htm The Iran-Contra Affair 20 Years On], The National Security Archive, (2006-11-24). Retrieved on 2008-07-13).</ref> At the meeting Shackley told Hashemi and Ghorbanifar that the United States was willing to discuss arms shipments in exchange for the four Americans kidnapped in Lebanon. Buckley was already dead at this point.

==Death and memorials==
On Islamic Jihad announced that it had executed William Buckley. The US National Security Council acknowledged in a now unclassified note that Buckley probably died on June 3, 1985 of pneumonia-like symptoms<ref name="gup3">US Security Council, "U.S./Iranian Contacts and the American Hostages"

'''William Francis Buckley''' (* US-Armee und ''operierender'' Agent der Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 

== Leben ==
William Francis Buckley trat nach Abschluss der High School 1947 in die US-Armee ein, für die er am Koreakrieg teilnahm. 1955 bis 1957 war er für die CIA tätig. Nach weiteren militärischen Stationen trat er in den 60er Jahren wieder in die Dienste der CIA.

Buckley wurde am 16. März 1984 von der islamischen Gruppe ''Heiliger islamischer Krieg'' entführt, während er als ''CIA-chief of station'' in Beirut (Libanon) arbeitete. Er wurde das Opfer von Folter und Verhören in einer 444 Tage andauernden Behandlung in den Händen seiner Entführer. Die Person, die seine Folter deckte, war Imad Mughniyah, ein ehemaliger Führer der Hisbollah. Buckley wurde möglicherweise an Bord eines iranischen Flugzeugs über Damaskus nach Teheran geschmuggelt. Er starb in der Gefangenschaft in Beirut nach Krankheit und Misshandlung.

Buckley wurde auf dem Nationalfriedhof Arlington, Virginia, beerdigt.

Der Direktor der CIA, William Webster, rühmte Buckley mit den Worten: „''Bill's success in collecting information in situations of incredible danger was exceptional, even remarkable.''“

== Die Reaktion der CIA ==
Die CIA rächte sich am 8. März 1985 durch die Zündung einer Autobombe in Beirut, um den spirituellen Führer der Hisbollah, Scheich Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, einen Schüler des Ayatollah Khomeini, zu töten. Fadlallah entkam unverletzt, aber 81 Menschen wurden bei der Explosion getötet. Dies führte wiederum zu neuen Entführungen von westlichen Personen und zu der Entführung von ''TWA-Flug 847''.<ref>
