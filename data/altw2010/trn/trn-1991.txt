==USS ''Triton'' (SSRN-586)==
In January 1958, he attended the Navy's training program for atomic reactors in order to quality for his next command, the USS ''Triton'', the nation's fifth nuclear powered submarine.<ref>Beach, ''Salt and Steel'', p. 261 - 262</ref>

In November 1959, Beach took command of the USS ''Triton'', the first and only American nuclear-powered submarine to be equipped with two nuclear reactors. Departing New London on what was supposed to have been a "shake-down" cruise in February 1960, ''Triton'' began a 1960 circumnavigation of the earth in 84 days without surfacing, covering over 41,000 statute miles, an unprecedented feat. The route of ''Triton'' followed roughly that of Ferdinand Magellan in 1519-1522. The scientific and military significance of the ''Triton'' voyage was overshadowed by the U-2 Incident which broke just as ''Triton'' was returning.<ref>“Triton Follows Magellan's Wake” by Edward L. Beach. ''National Geographic'', November 1960 (Vol. 118, No. 5)</ref>  

For successfully completing its mission, ''Triton'' was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.<ref>[http://garrygray.tripod.com/presidential_unit_citation.htm] Presidential Unit Citation dated May 10, 1960</ref>  At a special White House ceremony, Captain Beach was presented the Legion of Merit by President Eisenhower.<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=11777&st=&st1=] Citation accompanying Award of Legion of Merit to Captain Edward L. Beach, USN, dated May 10th, 1960</ref>  Beach wrote about the ''Triton'''s voyage in his book ''Around the World Submerged: The Voyage of the Triton'', published in 1962.

Following her post-shakedown availability, ''Triton'' deployed to European waters with the Second Fleet to participate in ''Ark Royal'' and ''Hermes'' under the command of Rear Admiral Sir Charles Madden.  The deployment was climaxed with a port visit to Bremerhaven, West Germany, the first visit by a nuclear-powered ship to a European port.<ref>Beach, ''Salt and Steel'', p. 263 - 269</ref>

====Subron 8, National War College & OpNav====
After his tour in command of ''Triton'', Beach assumed command of Submarine Squadron Eight from July 1961 to August 1962. Beach then was sent by the Navy to the National War College, where he completed a course of study in July 1963, and at the same time earned a Master of Arts degree in International Relations from George Washington University.  From July 1963 to December 1966, Beach served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OpNav) preparing annual budget reports for Congress and prepping the Secretary of the Navy (Fred Korth, Paul B. Fay, and Paul H. Nitze) and the Chief of Naval Operations {George W. Anderson Jr. and David L. McDonald) for hearings before Congressional committees.

Having been commissioned an Ensign in 1939, Beach rose to the rank of Captain, retiring from active duty after 27 years in 1966.

:''The Navy Cross is presented to Edward Latimer Beach, Lieutenant Commander, United States Navy, for gallantry and intrepidity in action as Executive Officer, Navigator and Assistant Approach Officer on board the U.S.S. TIRANTE (SS-420) on the First War Patrol of that submarine during the period 3 March 1945 to 25 April 1945, in enemy controlled waters of the East China Sea. Lieutenant Commander Beach rendered valiant service to his commanding officer in penetrating mined and shoal-obstructed shallow waters in defiance of hostile shore-based radar stations and aircraft. By his excellent judgment and keen understanding of attack problems, he aided immeasurably in sending torpedoes into targets with deadly accuracy and contributed to the sinking of three Japanese cargo ships, one large transport, a hostile tanker, three patrol frigates, and one lugger, totaling 28,000 tons of shipping vital to the enemy's ability to prosecute the war. Through his experience and sound judgment he assisted in bringing his ship safely back to port. His conduct throughout was an inspiration to his officers and men and in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.''<ref>[http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/1_Citations/03_wwii-nc/nc_06wwii_navy.html] ''Full Text Citations For Award of The Navy Cross'' @ HomeOfHeroes.com</ref>

==Naval War College and Capitol Hill==
Beach retired from active duty in the Navy in 1966, and was appointed as the Stephen B. Luce Chair of Naval Science at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island &mdash; the first person to hold that position.  During his tenure he was the editor of the ''Naval War College Review''. 

Subsequently Beach served for seven years as staff director of the United States Senate Republican Policy Committee, and for one year as chief of staff for Senator Jeremiah Denton (R-Alabama).

==Author==
thumb|right|[[Burt Lancaster and 1958 film adaptation of ''Run Silent, Run Deep'']]
After World War II, Beach wrote extensively in his spare time following in the footsteps of his father, who was also a career naval officer and author. His first book ''Submarine!''  (1952) was a compilation of accounts of several wartime patrols made by his own as well as other submarines, which ''TIME'' magazine called "the liveliest and most authentic account of underseas combat to come out of World War II."<ref name="time"/> 

In all, Beach published thirteen books, but is best known for his first novel, ''Run Silent, Run Deep'' (1955), which appeared on ''movie of the same name, based loosely on the novel and starring Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster, was released by United Artists in 1958.  Beach penned two sequels to ''Run Silent, Run Deep'': ''Dust on the Sea'' (1972), relating in detail a war patrol by ''Eel'' leading a wolf pack, and ''Cold is the Sea'' (1978), set in 1961 aboard a nuclear submarine.

In addition to ''Submarine!'', Beach wrote several more books on naval history, including ''The Wreck of the Memphis'' (1966); ''United States Navy: 200 Years'' (1986), a general history of the Navy; ''Scapegoats: A Defense of Kimmel and Short at Pearl Harbor'' (1995); and ''Salt and Steel: Reflections of a Submariner'' (1999).  ''Keepers of the Sea'' (1983) is a stunning pictorial record of the modern navy  with photography by Fred J. Maroon.  For a number of years Beach was co-editor of ''Naval Terms Dictionary'' as that standard reference work passed through several editions.  His last work, completed shortly before his death, was to prepare for publication his father's manuscript of his own distinguished service in the navy.  That book, ''From Annapolis to Scapa Flow: The Autobiography of Edward L. Beach, Sr'' (2003), is Captain Beach, Sr.'s personal account of the navy from the age of sail to the age of steam.

In addition to his books, Beach was a prolific author of articles and book reviews for periodicals ranging from ''Blue Book Magazine'' to ''National Geographic'', and ''Naval History'' to ''American Heritage''.
