'''Deanna Troi''' () is a main character in the science-fiction TV series ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and related TV series and films.  In the seventh season, Troi takes the Bridge Officer's Exam, and (with the help of William Riker) is promoted to the rank of Commander. Despite this promotion, Troi nominally serves as ship's counsellor.  

The character was portrayed by actress Marina Sirtis.

==Development and casting==

Marina Sirtis at first read for the role of Tasha Yar in 1986. She had, in total, five readings all with Gene Roddenberry and other executives. It has been noted that Roddenberry took a liking to her almost immediately. <ref>Adam Schrager, "Marina Sirtis: From Hoi Polloi to Counselor Troi" ''The Finest Crew in the Fleet: The Next Generation's Cast On Screen and Off''. New York: Wolf Valley Books (1997): 147. "She landed a guest role on the series ''Hunter''. Other small television roles followed, but no steady work came her way during her short stay. Just before she was to return home -- broke, credit cards "maxed out," and depressed -- Sirtis auditioned for the role of the chief security officer aboard the ''USS Enterprise'', Lieutenant Macha Hernandez (later changed to Natasha Yar)."</ref> Denise Crosby, who eventually won the role of Tasha, auditioned for the role of Deanna Troi.<ref>Adam Schrager, "Marina Sirtis: From Hoi Polloi to Counselor Troi" ''The Finest Crew in the Fleet: The Next Generation's Cast On Screen and Off''. New York: Wolf Valley Books (1997): 147. "Meanwhile, Denise Crosby had been auditioning for the role of Lieutenant Commander Deanna Troi, the ship's Betazoid counselor."</ref> It was said that Marina Sirtis had a more "exotic" feel about her (as stated in the dvd extras found on a bonus Star Trek TNG DVD).

She was just about to return home, in debt and jobless when she received "the phone call" alerting her to the fact that she had the role of Deanna Troi. She stated that had it been but an hour later she would have missed it and been on her way to England.

==Character background & fan reception==

In the series, Deanna Troi served as ship's ''USS Enterprise'' (designated NCC-1701-D & NCC-1701-E and referred to as Captain Jean-Luc Picard (portrayed by actor Patrick Stewart).

Fictional character Deanna Troi was born on 2336, near Lake El-Nar,<ref>
</ref> Betazed.  Parents are a Betazoid mother and Ambassador, Lwaxana Troi (portrayed by actress Majel Barrett, real life widow of television director/producer/writer and ''Star Trek'' creator ''Gene Roddenberry'') and a human father, deceased Starfleet officer Lt. Ian Andrew Troi. In the character background, an older sister, Kestra, drowned during Deanna's infancy (note: "Dark Page"). Although Deanna Troi has little exposure to planet Earth culture, she attended Starfleet Academy from 2355 to 2359, as well as the University on Betazed, and earned an advanced degree in psychology.

In depicting a possible phenomenon of galactic travel, the series creates several fictional alien races including a Betazoid race that have extra-sensory empath with clairsentience. As viewed in ''Star Trek: Nemesis'', Troi has the ability to connect to another psychic and follow that empathic bond to its source. In this instance, her ability enables the Enterprise-E to target and hit the Romulan vessel ''Scimitar'', despite the fact that it was cloaked. There are several species who are resistant to telepathy of Deanna and other Betazoids, most notably are the Ferengi and the Breen.

She is called various names, usually depending upon the circumstances: 
Captain Picard calls her "Counselor" but when he is concerned about her or in emergencies he called her by her first name "Deanna."
Doctor Crusher (one of her most noted female friends) usually calls her "Troi"
Data very rarely calls her by her first name but usually as "Counselor Troi"

Early in the series, Troi finds herself working with an early love, the newly assigned Commander William T. Riker (a character portrayed by actor Jonathan Frakes). In later episodes, Troi has romantic involvements with several others, including a brief relationship with Klingon Starfleet officer Lt. Worf (portrayed by actor Michael Dorn).

Throughout Star Trek TNG, all primary characters have their own "Key" episodes. These include:

'''Season 1''': ''Encounter at Farpoint'' - Start of her service onboard the USS Enterprise.
''Skin of Evil'' - Troi is trapped inside a shuttle leading to the resulting death of her colleague and friend

'''Season 2''': ''The Child'' - Deanna becomes pregnant to an alien host

'''Season 4''': ''The Loss'' - Deanna temporarily loses her telepathic abilities and learns to depend upon her "human half"

'''Season 7''': ''All Good Things'' - Deanna dies in an alternate future

After Season 4, Deanna takes charge of the Enterprise D, after it is seriously damaged by an unknown space entity.  Initially hesitant, she grows into her first command role.  By putting the safety of her crew before her own, she demonstrates her value as a leader.
