'''''Loose Change''''' (2005) is a series of  documentary films written and directed by Dylan Avery, and produced by Korey Rowe and Jason Bermas and is distributed by MercuryMedia International. The films assert that the September 11, 2001 attacks were planned and conducted by elements within the United States government, and base the claims on perceived anomalies in the historical record of the attacks. The  first film, ''Loose Change'', was originally released through the creators' own company, Louder Than Words, and received widespread attention after ''Loose Change 2nd Edition'' was featured on a Binghamton, New York local FOX affiliate, WICZ-TV (FOX 40).<ref>[http://www.nowpublic.com/ny_fox_affiliate_airs_alternative_9_11_theory NY FOX affiliate airs alternative 9/11 theory, "Loose Change"]</ref>

The original film was edited and re-released as ''Loose Change: 2nd Edition'', and then subsequently re-edited again for the ''2nd Edition Recut'', each time to tighten the focus on certain key areas and to remove what the filmmakers have learned to be inaccuracies and copyrighted material. ''Loose Change: Final Cut'', deemed "the third and final release of this documentary series"<ref name="finalcutbio"></ref> was released on DVD and Web-streaming format on November 11, 2007.<ref></ref> This installment is a completely new film; using almost none of the same content appearing in the previous Loose Change versions.

==History==
''Loose Change'' originated as a plan for a fictional film, on the advice that to make a successful film a filmaker must offer the audience something they want to watch, and as the concept advanced through research into footage and resources for the film, the film became a documentary.

In May 2002, Dylan Avery began researching the 9/11 attacks and based on his research he concluded they were not a terrorist attack involving only members of Al Qaeda, but rather that they were an attack orchestrated by members of the United States government. <ref name="loosechange911.com"></ref>

In April 2005, the first edition of ''Loose Change'' was made available for free on the Internet and was given a limited DVD release to certain video stores.  It cost around $2000 to make, and was made primarily on Avery's laptop computer, featuring a distinctive soundtrack produced by DJ Skooly.  Avery's childhood friend, Korey Rowe, left the service of the U.S. military in June 2005 to assist with the marketing of the movie.<ref name="loosechange911.com"/>

Soon after this, Avery decided that "there was new information that needed to be added and improvements made", and so began creating ''Loose Change: 2nd Edition''.  Korey Rowe assumed the role of producer, and Jason Bermas, a graphic designer, worked as independent movie production company called Louder than Words before the release of this edition, an organization that identifies with the "9/11 Truth Movement".<ref></ref>

The third and final edition of the movie, ''Loose Change Final Cut'', was released in November 2007.  According to the Loose Change website, this edition "is substantially different from Loose Change and Loose Change 2nd Edition Recut in the way it presents the information surrounding 9/11/2001. However, it remains true to the spirit that has made Loose Change what it is today."<ref name="finalcutbio"/> Professor radio host Alex Jones and Tim Sparke of Mercury Media served as executive producers. Due to an estimated cost of $200,000, this version is the first not to be available for free online, although it is in fact available for free on Google Video in a lower quality version, currently having amassed nearly 30,000 hits.  This edition is also substantially longer than previous versions, at over 2 hours in length.

==Presentation==
''Loose Change: 2nd Edition Recut'' is one hour and 22 minutes in length. The film consists of Dylan Avery narrating over photographs and news footage relating to 9/11, with an underscore of  Ground Zero on September 11, 2006.

===Revisions===

Although each version of the film asserts that the events of 9/11 were essentially an "inside job", there were significant revisions between the particular theories that different editions posited.  For example: 

*The first edition, ''Loose Change'', suggested that there was an unusual device (which the filmmakers refer to as a "pod") under the fuselage of the plane that struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center. The "pod" was presented as evidence that the planes involved in the attack were replaced with remote-controlled drones. Official flight records were also presented as evidence that the aircraft involved are still in active service, though it is stated that the producers do not know what happened to the passengers of the flights.  This information is omitted from all subsequent versions.
*While the first edition asserted that Flight 93 was shot down over Pennsylvania, ''Loose Change 2nd Edition'' and ''Loose Change 2nd Edition Recut'' theorise that Flight 93 was actually flown to and landed at Cleveland Hopkins Airport.  The third edition states less information about Flight 93, but maintains that it is impossible that it crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
*The first and second editions asserted that a missile hit the Pentagon, but ''Loose Change Final Cut'' presents two scenarios, saying that "opinions differ" about whether or not Flight 77 hit the Pentagon.

On Naudet brothers. The letter states that Avery used copyrighted images from the film ''9/11'' and that those the images violate the  Federal Lanham Trademark Act "by suggesting that the Naudet brothers or Mr. Hanlon have endorsed or sponsored the controversial views in your film."  The letter concludes: "Accordingly, we hereby demand that you confirm to us within three (3) business days of the receipt of this letter that you have removed all footage taken from our clients' 9/11 film from your Loose Change film, including from the version of your film that can be downloaded on the Internet, the DVD version of your film and anywhere else you have used or are using our clients' footage."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/05/911_documentary_removed/|

*The statement that B-52 bomber in 1945 was corrected; it was in fact a B-25 Mitchell, which is less than one-third the size of a B-52.
*References to the rumors concerning the amount of gold stored beneath the World Trade Center (such as one claim of $167 billion in gold) were removed, leaving only confirmed statements, including that of the "$230 million in precious metals".
*The implication the film makes that Flight 77 had Rolls-Royce engines.
*Multiple instances of Wikipedia articles being shown as source material were removed and replaced with news articles containing the reported information.
*Throughout the film minor changes in talking points, images and language were made.

===Impact===

An August 2006 Vanity Fair article suggested that ''Loose Change'' "just might be the first Internet blockbuster" as it became the most watched video on Google Video in May 2006, being viewed at least 40 million times on that site, and with the official Loose Change website receiving over 100,000 hits a day.  Millions more have viewed the film via unaffiliated websites.  More than one million copies of the DVD have been sold, and many more have been given away.<ref>[http://www.vanityfair.com/ontheweb/features/2006/08/loosechange200608 "Click Here for Conspiracy"], Vanity Fair article, by Nancy Jo Sales, August 2006</ref>

==Content of 2nd Edition Recut==

300px|thumb|right|Flyer for a screening of the film.

''Loose Change 2nd Edition Recut'' (2006) opens with a brief description of past suspicious and questionable motives in the history of American government. This discussion includes mention of Operation Northwoods, a plan put forward, but never implemented, during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 to create and utilize bogus terrorist attacks against the United States, which were to be blamed on Cuba, as a pretext for invasion of the country. Focus is particularly directed at the previously proposed plans to substitute real commercial airliners with pilotless drone aircraft in order to investigate the plausibility of covertly using them as weapons, whilst maintaining the cover of an accident.<ref></ref>
