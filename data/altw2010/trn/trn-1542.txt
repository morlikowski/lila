'''구로야나기 데쓰코'''(,1933년 8월 9일 ~ )는 일본의 여배우, MC, 수필가, 평화운동가이다. 일명 ‘토토짱’(). 같은 TV프로그램(세계 신기한 발견!)에 출연하는 반도 에이지로부터는 ‘엄마’()라고 불린다.

TV프로그램 데쓰코의 방(徹子の部屋)의 사회자이자, 일본 최대의 베스트 셀러인 창가의 토토로 잘 알려져 있다. ‘양파’(玉ねぎ) 등으로 불리는 머리모양으로도 유명하다.

이름의 유래는, 양친이 남자아이가 태어날 것으로 생각해 ‘데쓰’(徹)란 이름이 붙여졌으나, 실제로 여자아이로 태어난 이유로 ‘코’(子)를 붙여 ‘데쓰코’가 되었다. 저서의 제목인 유소년기의 애칭 ‘토토짱’은, 바로 이 미리 지어진 이름이었던 ‘토오루’(徹를 읽는 법의 하나)에서 따온 것이다. 한편 ‘구로야나기’로 서명할 때에는 ‘柳’의 다른 글자인 ‘栁’를 쓴다.

참고로, 사회자로서도 ‘비탁음의 명수’로 손꼽힐 정도로 유명하다.
