Il montre à plusieurs reprises des signes de dyslexie et à tendance à perdre son calme lorsque survient un problème. Il est chargé des pires corvés du bar: "le travail de Charlie". Assez naïf, Mac et Dennis le manipule fréquemment en testant ses capacités et son courage.
Bien que d'apparence, il semble totalement dénué d'intélligence, Charlie s'avère être le meilleur musicien de la bande.
Charlie n'est pas très doué avec les filles mais il est follement amoureux de la serveuse d'un café qui est, elle, très attirée par Dennis.

==Cast and characters==
===Main cast===
*'''prep and a self-described "ladies' man". Dennis' self-esteem is derived chiefly from his appearance, so he takes criticism of his looks very poorly. A running joke throughout season three showed Dennis constantly removing his shirt to display his physique. Dennis was popular in high school, but his prom date dumped him for another man. Despite making less than $400 a week at the bar, his family's wealth enables Dennis to wear stylish clothing and drive a Range Rover. He earned good grades at the University of Pennsylvania and minored in psychology, though his original ambition was to become a veterinarian. He listens to hair metal and Rick Astley.

*'''Penn (where she had majored in psychology but failed her classes) to become an actress, but has put little effort into realizing her ambition. Although she identifies herself as a compassionate liberal, she will always put herself first and often has the same prejudices as her friends and brother. She is highly sensitive about her appearance and her professional failings. She was unpopular in high school due to her severe scoliosis, which forced her to wear a back brace and earned her the nickname "The Aluminum Monster". Since high school, she has had a long string of failed relationships. Like the other members of the gang, she drinks heavily, especially to calm herself after meeting an attractive man. Deandra also harbors a phobia regarding the elderly. Despite her many insecurities, Dee is aggressively outspoken and prone to violence when angered. Dee was the only major character in the show to be conceived without an actor in mind. Although Deandra was originally written as a female voice of sanity to contrast with her ill-intentioned co-stars, the character became an equal participant in the gang's activities after Olson was cast.<ref>[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/news/article_1347014.php/Its_Always_Sunny_screen_test_college_tour_ 'It's Always Sunny' screen test college tour - Smallscreen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

*'''Rob McElhenney''' as '''Mac''': Mac is Charlie's friend from childhood and Dennis' high school friend, later roommate. He is co-owner of Paddy's and generally the pub's most active manager. He comes from a broken home, as his father was an incarcerated meth dealer, and Mac sold drugs to popular students in high school to gain their friendship. Mac constantly seeks the acceptance of others, especially his parents, but his over-earnest efforts more often than not cause him to be considered an "asshole". Mac also makes frequent attempts to be "hard", usually to impress his criminal father, but he generally flees from confrontation and fares poorly in fights. Mac is Catholic and the only member of the group to profess a religious faith, but this has done little to affect his general lack of ethics (though he is opposed to abortion, unless he is the father of the child). 

*'''learning disabilities, including retarded" and illiterate by other characters. Despite this, he has a great deal of self-confidence (except when it comes to performing on stage) and is generally unshaken by the gang's insults and criticism of him.  All of the most tedious and disgusting tasks at the bar are called "Charlie Work", even when he is temporarily spared from performing them. He tends to squander the little money he earns from the bar on "bad investments." He has an extremely short fuse and is prone to Al Pacino-styled outbursts. Mac and Dennis frequently manipulate him into tests of his fortitude, and consider him to be almost impossible to injure. Charlie has no success in dating, and harbors an unrequited crush on a cafe waitress. Despite his apparent lack of intelligence, Charlie is the most skilled musician in the group and has concocted elaborate plans to achieve his desires. He spent the majority of his life without a father figure until the finale episode of season two, when he learned who his father is.

*'''Danny DeVito''' as '''Frank Reynolds''': Frank is the legal father of Dennis and Dee. Frank is a successful businessman and he has a long history of shady business endeavors. He was introduced in the first episode of the second season as a man undergoing a midlife crisis. He divorced Dennis and Dee's mother and decided to join in his children's lazy, scheming lifestyle. Frank became co-owner of Paddy's by purchasing land underneath it, and then using this leverage to forcibly join the gang. Frank is a master manipulator and frequently takes the lead in the group's schemes. Frank knows many sordid characters around town, including a ring of Asian gamblers who the gang find creepy. He claims to have his children's best interests at heart but frequently exploits and insults them. During the second season finale he discovers that Dennis and Dee are not actually his children, but that he is the biological father of Charlie following a one night stand with Charlie's mother 30 years ago. He may actually be Dennis and Dee's biological father because an definite paternity test was never taken by Bruce Mathis to see if he is indeed the biological father of Denis and Dee. One episode involved Deandra visiting her Nazi grandfather, whom bore a striking resemblance to Dennis as a young man, which could prove that Frank is, in fact, the twins' biological father; however, it was never made clear whether the children's grandfather was the father of the children's mother or father.

===Recurring cast===
*'''Mary Elizabeth Ellis''' as '''The Waitress''': A nameless, recovering alcoholic waitress at a cafe, with whom Charlie is madly in love. The Waitress has no interest in Charlie, but harbors her own unrequited crush on Dennis. Charlie goes to great lengths to woo her, and she goes to equally great lengths to attract Dennis' attention. Mary Elizabeth Ellis is Charlie Day's real-life wife.

*'''Anne Archer''' as '''Barbara Reynolds''': Frank's gold-digging ex-wife and the mother of Dennis and Dee. She is a cold, cruel, and selfish woman with little affection for her family. The finale of season two revealed that Barbara tricked Frank into raising the twins because she thought he was wealthier than Dennis and Dee's biological father, Bruce Mathis (Stephen Collins). She has a vindictive streak, sleeping with Mac solely to make Frank jealous during their divorce, and cutting her children out of her will for petty and illogical reasons. She passes away in the third season.  

*'''Stephen Collins''' as '''Bruce Mathis'''. The antithesis of Frank Reynolds, Bruce is Dennis and Dee's biological father.  Bruce devotes most of his time to helping suffering children in Africa, several of whom he has adopted.  He first appears in Episode 210, "Dennis and Dee Get a New Dad." He later appears in  Episode 303, "Dennis and Dee's Mom is Dead", where he inherits Barbara's fortune.

*'''Lynne Marie Stewart''' as '''Bonnie Kelly''': Charlie's mom, a sweet and timid woman who is attracted to cruel men. She had a one-night stand with Frank Reynolds 30 years ago, making him the biological father of Charlie. She later reconnects with Frank through myspace.com, enjoying his harsh treatment and becoming his "bang-maid", but quickly transfers her affections to the malevolent Luther after meeting him at a dinner party.

*'''Gregory Scott Cummins''' as '''Luther''': Mac's father and a convicted felon. In his first appearance in the episode "Dennis and Dee Get a New Dad," Mac and Charlie visit him in prison to bond with him, and he attempts to get them to smuggle heroin into the prison. He plays a larger role in "Dennis Looks Like a Registered Sex Offender," this time out on parole and convincing Mac to help him "take care of some people." He is tall, has numerous tattoos, and mentions that he rarely blinks, giving him a generally intimidating appearance. The warm and gentle Bonnie Kelly is attracted to Luther's aloof behavior and criminal past, and the two begin a relationship.
