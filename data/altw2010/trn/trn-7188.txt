'''Robert Dennis "Danny" Blanchflower''' (footballer, football manager, and Spurs during their double-winning season of 1961. He is remembered as one of the great tacticians in the history of the game, renowned for his passing, and as an outstanding right-half.

==Early years==
Blanchflower was born February 10, 1926 in the Bloomfield district of Belfast, Northern Ireland; his mother had played as a centre-forward on a women's football team. He was educated at Ravenscroft public elementary school and was awarded a scholarship to Belfast College of Technology. His younger brother Jackie Blanchflower played for Manchester United.

He left early to become an apprentice electrician at Gallagher's cigarette factory in Belfast. He also joined the Air Raid Precautions (ARP) and in 1943 lied about his age in order to join the RAF. As a trainee navigator he was sent on a course to St Andrews University (where he acquired a lifelong love of golf) and in the spring of 1945 was posted to Canada for further training. By 1946 he was back in Belfast, back at Gallagher's, and building a reputation as an outstanding footballer.

==Playing career==
He began his professional football career at the end of the Second World War when he was signed by Belfast side Glentoran. In Aston Villa bought him for £15,000. He played 155 times for Villa, captaining the side on many occasions. 

He grew disenchanted with the club and the way training was conducted, becoming one of the first to propose that players should train with a ball as opposed to merely undertaking physical exercise. In 1954 he was bought by Tottenham Hotspur F.C. (Spurs) for the huge fee of £30,000, and during his ten years at White Hart Lane he made 337 league appearances.

The highlight of his time at Spurs came with the 1960–61 season. With Blanchflower as captain Spurs won their first 11 games, still a record for the top flight of English football and eventually ran out as league champions by 8 points. They then beat Leicester City in the final of the FA Cup to become the first team in the 20th century to win the league and cup double, not achieved since Aston Villa in 1897.

In Ipswich Town and Burnley, and in European Cup Winners' Cup.

Between 1949 and 1963, he earned 56 caps for Northern Ireland, often playing alongside his brother Jackie, and in World Cup.
