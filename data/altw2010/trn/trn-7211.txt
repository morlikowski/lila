Fu fra i più popolari e rappresentativi tra le due guerre mondiali.

Nel panorama hollywoodiano di grandi seduttori, di divi belli, eleganti ed impomatati, Beery si presentava con il suo volto grosso e ghignante, la sua corporatura tozza, i suoi gesti sgraziati e a volte volgari, ma con una potente carica di simpatia e di vitalità, con una comunicativa eccezionale, il tutto sorretto da un istrionismo di elevato livello, che rendeva incisive e indimenticabili le sue interpretazioni di personaggi buffi e commoventi, rozzi eppure dotati di una forte umanità.

Il suo film più significativo fu Viva Villa! (1934).<br/>
Altre interpretazioni notevoli le fornì in Il mondo perduto (Il campione (Grand Hotel (L'isola del tesoro (1934), Sui mari della Cina (1935).

Figlio di un poliziotto, aveva cominciato come aiuto domatore di elefanti al Ringling Brothers Circus, dove fu ferito a un braccio da un leopardo. In seguito, grazie all'incoraggiamento del fratello Noah Beery Sr., si stabilì a New York per lavorare in teatro come cantante e interprete di spettacoli di varietà. Dopo un periodo in cui si alternò fra Broadway e spettacoli itineranti, si trasferì a Hollywood ed esordì nel cinema recitando particine comiche e cominciando ad affermarsi dopo il 1920.
