Union County was formed in 1821. It was so named because it is the product of a union of parts of Fayette, Franklin and Wayne counties.

The first county seat was Brownsville, a small town located on the East Fork of the Whitewater River.  The seat was moved in 1824 to Liberty, a central location.  The primary industry of Union County was and is farming.
