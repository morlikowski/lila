==History==
During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Israeli forces managed to capture the town lands, but never managed to capture the town itself. According to Gilmour: "With the news of the armistice the inhabitants were furious that they had simply been handed over [by Abdullah I of Jordan ] to Israel but were understandably relieved that they were to be reunited with their land. Or so they thought. However, the Law of Acquisition of Absentee Property, which was passed in 1950 but made retroactive, was specially devised to take care of cases like this. Although they had not moved from their village, the inhabitants were declared "absentees" (or Internally Displaced Palestinians) and their land "abandoned property". According to the villagers, they lost 8,000 of their 11,000 acres (45 km²). (Walter Schwarz: The Arabs in Israel Faber & Faber, London 1959, p. 40, and Israel and Palestine, No. 51 (August 1976), p.1. Both quoted in Gilmour, p. 106))
