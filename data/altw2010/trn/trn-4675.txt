'''James David Ward''' (born Sparta. A self-taught guitarist and pianist, he was also the co-founder of the seminal (and now defunct) post-hardcore band At the Drive-In. 

==At the Drive-In==
While in At the Drive-In, Ward played rhythm guitar and sang backup vocals, as well as playing piano and keyboards on select songs. He performed lead vocals on one track, entitled "Hourglass", and sang co-lead with lead vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala on a number of tracks. Using the money from his college savings, he created the label "Western Breed Records" specifically to release Hell Paso and Alfaro Vive, Carajo!, At the Drive-in's first two releases. After the demise of At the Drive-In, Ward has stated that he is happy with the break-up, that he started the band when he was 17, and felt like he was always 17 while in the band.

==Sparta==
After the fall of At the Drive-In, Ward did not have the intentions of starting Sparta. His first plans included going back to college<ref>[http://www.withoutasound.net/?section=multimedia&page=ap_06 WithoutASound.net — The Online Sparta Community<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and enjoying himself in his new marriage. Eventually, former At the Drive-In members Tony Hajjar and Paul Hinojos asked Ward if he would like to be a part of their new project. Ward joined the group as the lead vocalist and guitar player. The band wrote nearly nine songs in their first week of rehearsal, with all members incorporating ideas and lyrics. Ward cites Radiohead and Billy Joel as influences for his songwriting during this period, which led to Ward incorporating more piano in Sparta (despite his informal knowledge of the instrument).<ref>[http://www.kindamuzik.net/interview/sparta/sparta-it-s-hard-as-shit-to-sing-in-key-man KindaMuzik - Interview: Sparta - Sparta: It's hard as shit to sing in key, man!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.
