'''''Kill Me, Kiss Me''''' (K2-케이투-, ''Kei Tu'') is a Korean author English by Tokyopop between February 2004 and February 2005. Tokyopop radically redesigned the covers of the volumes from how they appeared in the Korean version.

==Plot==
''Kill Me, Kiss Me'' is a story with two separate but loosely connected plots. The first, spanning only the first volume of the manhwa, centers around the high school girl Tae Yeon Im and her obsession over a handsome model named Kun Kang. Tae finds out that Kun goes to the same school as her cousin Jung-Woo Im, to whom she is almost identical in appearance. She makes a deal with Jung-Woo to trade places so she can get closer to the model of her dreams, though they settle on only one week for the switch. However, upon arriving at Pure Water High, she promptly gets beaten up by the gang member Ga-Woon Kim, apparently Kun Kang's closest friend. Despite this minor setback, Tae does not give up and goes back to the school the next day to continue her attempt to get closer with Kun. Most of the rest of the plot from this first sexuality.

The second arc in the ''Kill Me, Kiss Me'' series spans the rest of the manhwa from volumes two through five, and has almost no connection with the first arc. The story now concentrates on the beautiful girl Que-Min Ghun, who although appearing innocent at first glance is actually incredibly strong. She attends the same school as Jung-Woo and after meeting him one day in the street, starts to develop a crush on him, going as far as trying to protect him from people like Ghoon-Hahm Che and his gang, the Yi Won. Eventually, Ghoon-Hahm offers an arrangement: in exchange for not beating up Jung-Woo, Que-Min will have to go out with the gang leader himself. Ghoon-Hahm and Que-Min start their forced relationship, and Que-Min finally gets Jung-Woo to remember her name and notice her.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
;Tae Yeon Im: Tae Yeon is the main heroine of the first arc of the story but otherwise appears relatively sparingly throughout the rest of the series. She tends to be a strong-willed girl who doesn't usually give up very easily, and is also not afraid to pick a fight with others stronger than her. She switches places with her male cousin Jung-Woo in order to get closer to a model she admires named Kun Kang. Although eventually she starts to learn more about Kun and his best friend Ga-Woon who she also starts developing feelings towards.

;Jung-Woo Im: He is the main character of the second arc of the story though serves to start the plot for the first arc. Most of the time Jung-Woo is very passive, showing no emotion unless he's engaged in a fight. Despite his frail appearance, he is relatively physically strong, which takes his opponents off guard. His most defining feature is that he looks a lot like a female, especially later on when he grows his hair out. He has an intense affinity towards dogs as when he was young he found a stray he later named Ghost though it died after it got run over by a car.

;Kun Kang: A male model who attends Pure Water High School who is usually either gone from school in a photo shoot, found sleeping in class, or otherwise hanging around his best friend Ga-Woon Kim who he has known since junior high school. Other than in the first arc, he almost never appears again.
  
;Ga-Woon Kim: He is the leader of his small gang though has still gained a reputation as being a strong deviant character. After Tae and Jung-Woo switch places, he eventually finds himself starting to feel attracted to Tae, though while still thinking her as Jung-Woo, he also starts to question his sexuality.

;Lin Lee: She is a short, conceited girl who uses a lot of different tactics to make herself more appealing to the eye, like wearing hair extensions, skin concealer, and plucking her eyebrows, among other things. She has developed a crush on Ghoon-Hahm, but he doesn't want anything to do with her and also barely even knows she exists. She is also the younger sister of Jin Lee, but the two weren't that close, even in their childhood.

;Kai: He is the leader of the Ghoo Won gang who knew Ghoon-Hahm back from junior high school, when he was known as Bok-Chil. After a run in they had together during a fight with about twenty other guys against Ghoon-Hahm, he fled to Japan only to come back later.

===Pretty-boy Fan Club members===
The "Pretty-boy Fan Club" is a club of a group of female students at Pure Water High School, where Jung-Woo also attends, who take pictures of all of the boys in their school who they view as especially attractive.

;Que-Min Ghun: One of the main characters of the second arc, she is a beautiful seventeen year old girl who has a past that she has tried very hard to forget. At her old school, she was known as a female thug due to how physically strong she is and this had somewhat of a bad reputation. However, after moving and attending a new school, she was determined not to show anyone new she met her other more stronger side and wanted to be viewed as a normal high school girl. One of her interests is writing and she has even taken it upon herself to start writing her first novel which she publishes online.

== Rollfigurer: ==
*'''Kun Kang:''' En manlig modell som har fått idolstatus. Har ett hektiskt schema och missar många lektioner i skolan. Men har han någon hjärna att utveckla över huvud taget?
*'''Tae Yeon Im:''' Går på gymnasiet och är kär i den berömde tonårsidolen Kun. När hon får reda på att Kun går på samma skola som hennes identiska kusin, Jung-Woo, så ser hon till att byta plats med kusinen och tvingar honom att gå till hennes flickskola iförd kjol.
*'''Jung-Woo Im:''' Byter plats med sin kusin, går på flickskolan i flickkläder... något som inte verkar störa honom alls. Antingen är det för att han gillar att vara bland tjejer eller så har han inget emot att gå i kjol. Den typiske ensamvargen. Han är väldigt söt, vilket gör att han får mer uppmärksamhet än han egentligen skulle önska, speciellt från gängledaren Ghoon-Hahm.
*'''Ga-Woon Kim:''' Skolans värsting som inte har något emot att ge sig på Jung-Woo. Men på den senaste tiden har han känt en oförklarlig dragning till sitt offer.
*'''Que-Min Ghun:''' Hon var tidigare en riktig tuffing men försöker nu lämna det livet. Hon gillar stackars Jung-Woo, om han nu bara kunde komma ihåg hennes namn.
*'''Ghoon-Hahm Che:''' Har spöat Jung-Woo massor av gånger. Är det att han inte gillar den söta killens uppsyn... eller är det för att Que-Min gör det?
*'''Yang Me:''' Jung-Woo's såkallade "bästa kompis" och även medlem i Snyggingarnas fanclub, syns inte så mycket.
*'''Ghoon-Hahm's gäng:''' Bestående endast av killar.
*'''Lin Lee:''' En av killarnas i Ghoon-Hams's gäng, lillasyster som vill ha Ghoon-Hahm över allt annat.
*'''Nanashe Kai:''' Mystisk gäng ledare som visar sig i slutet av fjärde boken.
*'''Snöboll:''' Den lösdrivande hunden som Jung-Woo tar hand om.
