'''Romeo Muller, Jr.''' (American Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer''.

Muller was born Long Island. His talents in the arts were evident very early on. At age 11, he became a puppeteer at his grade school and eventually he began writing his own plays.

His career in theatre began when he joined an acting troupe called "Theater Go Round" in Virginia Beach, Virginia with producer/friend Lesley Savage. At this time Romeo wrote plays such as ''Angel With The Big, Big Ears'' and ''The Great Getaway'', which eventually became the Rankin-Bass off Broadway play ''A Month Of Sundays''. Since Romeo was a big man at 6'2" (1.88 m) and 300 pounds (136 kg), he decided to stray away from acting and turn his attention towards writing. 

After writing material for comedian Studio One'' and ''Philco Theatre''. He wrote one of the most popular episodes for the ''Studio One'' series entitled "Love Me To Pieces, Baby".

In NBC's ''holiday television special of all time ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer''. Muller embellished the short story into an hour-long broadcast and added a variety of characters into the story.

Muller is also known for his screenplays in other such films as ''Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town'', ''The Little Drummer Boy'', ''Here Comes Peter Cottontail'', and ''Frosty the Snowman'', among many others.

He was also the voice of the narrator, a talking sun in the first three Strawberry Shortcake TV specials from the 1980's, which he also wrote and co-produced.

Muller died in 1992 at the age of 64.

Romeo read his favorite and first Christmas story every year on Christmas Eve on New York radio station WGHQ. This story was reworked with a different ending for an animated film in 1992 and aired days before Romeo died.

In 2002 the book Jill Chill & the Baron of Glacier Mountain http://www.edmccray.comby Ed McCray featured a character named Romeo after Mr. Muller, the very King of Christmas specials. The book was very much written in the style of the old Christmas specials that Romeo wrote that we never see done these days, so it was fitting to add this to the tribute. Romeo's brother Gene wrote a review for the book praising how true it was written to the style of Romeo's work.
