The '''Puerto Rican national basketball team''' (or '''Puerto Rican national basketball selection''') is the men's side that represents women's and junior competitions.  

== History ==
In the Juan "Pachín" Vicéns. This was, and still is as of 2007, the highest place they have reached since the team's birth at any Olympic Games.<ref name="FIBA"></ref>

The 1970s brought some memorable moments for the team, particularly a dramatic one-point loss to the United States in the 1976 Olympics; a win would have been the first undisputed loss for the US in Olympic competition. During this decade, the 1974 Basketball World Championship and the 1979 Pan American Games were held in San Juan, promoting local enthusiasm for international basketball and Puerto Rico's presence in it.<ref name="FIBA"/> 

During the 1980s, the team earned gold medals at the American Los Angeles Olympics because they failed to qualify. The Puerto Ricans advanced to the second round in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, finishing in seventh place.<ref name="FIBA"/>

During the 1990s, their success continued as usual, as they begun the decade with a Fourth Place finish at the World Championship in Argentina.<ref name="FIBA"/> In 1991, they won, for the first time, the Gold Medal at the Pan American Games, held in Cuba.<ref name="FIBA"/> The team qualified for the 1992 Barcelona, Spain Olympics and they reached the second round there, facing the United States National team composed by NBA players in their first game of the elimination round. They finished in eighth place in Barcelona. In 1994, they finished in sixth place at the World Championship in Canada, and won the Gold Medal at the Goodwill Games competition.<ref name="FIBA"/> During this period, Puerto Rico was classified as one of the top 10 international teams.

In 1996, they placed 10th at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, USA, and conquered the first of back to back Gold medals at Centrobasket.<ref name="FIBA"/> In 2000, they retained the Centrobasket title, with another triumph in Mexico. In 2003, the team won the Gold medal at the Central American and Caribbean Games, held at El Salvador.<ref name="FIBA"/>

In 2002, the team had a strong showing at the World Championship held in Indianapolis, USA. In a tournament full of well-known professionals, including NBA superstars, they beat the top 3 European teams at the time; eventual champion Yugoslavia, Turkey and Spain. Puerto Rico, with a 5-1 record entering the quarterfinals, lost its chance to get into the medals round in a dramatic 2-point loss to New Zealand, eventually placing seventh.<ref name="FIBA"/>

The Puerto Rican National Basketball Team conquered the silver medal at the 2004 Centrobasket tournament, losing to the Dominican Republic, 75-74, in the championship game.<ref name="FIBA"/>

In NBA players were allowed to compete. The 92-73 outcome of that game is, as of 2007, the most lopsided victory against the US (collegiate or professional players) in the history of Olympic/World Championship basketball. The other team to defeat the U.S. had been the 1972 gold medal game (whose outcome is still disputed) and the 1988 semifinals.

On August 6, 2007, the team began in their first participation in a ''Caribe Basket'' tournament, debuting against Trinidad & Tobago.<ref name="Caribe Basket"></ref> Although the team didn't had the participation of Daniel Santiago or Rick Apodaca, they won the tournament which was classificatory for the 2008 Centrobasket.<ref name="Caribe Basket"/>

Puerto Rico was placed in Group D of the Fiba Preolympic Tournament in the draw that took place on Croatia and Cameroon and its winner would cross with the second place of Group C.<ref name="Pre"/> Following this event the president of the National Superior Basketball League confirmed that the team had already scheduled exhibition games against Germany, Greece and New Zealand beginning on Germany with scores of 85-83. In this game the team was mostly composed of reserve players, while Carlos Arroyo, Daniel Santiago, Larry Ayuso and Carmelo Lee were attending different compromises.<ref></ref> Puerto Rico continued playing with these players, finishing second in the Bamberg Super Cup, losing in the finals to Greece who entered the cup with their entire lineup.<ref></ref> Santiago and Ayuso joined the practices on July 5, 2008. Puerto Rico then traveled to Slovenia, where the Alpos Cup was being held. The first match in this tournament was against New Zealand, whom they defeated 82-74.<ref></ref> In the semifinals the team faced Iran, defeating them 83-80.<ref></ref> Puerto Rico finished second in ths cup, losing to Slovenia in the finals.<ref></ref> The Olympic Qualifying Tournament began on July 14, 2008, the team received a "bye" on its first day. Puerto Rico's debut came the following day, defeating Cameroon 81-72, advancing to the second round due to a loss that the African team suffered during the first day of competition. On its second game the team lost to Croatia. In the quarterfinals Puerto Rico defeated Slovenia 81-70.<ref></ref> The team didn't qualify to the Olympics, after losing to Greece in the semifinals and Germany in the tournament's bronze medal game.<ref></ref>

===2008-2012===
This Olympic cycle began with the 2008 CentroBasket competition, which was classificatory to the 2009 FIBA Americas Tournament. This event was scheluded to take place before the Olympic Qualifying Tournament, but due to time contraints it was postponed.

==Uniform==

During most of the 1980s and up until the late 1990s, the team wore a solid color uniform, with accent lines and the word "Puerto Rico" written in stylized cursive. Nowadays, the national team's uniform resembles a Puerto Rican flag, but also includes the usual Puerto Rico sign in cursive. The uniforms are red or blue for "visitor" status, and white for "host."
