'''Brigham Young University''' ('''BYU'''), located in private, coeducational research university owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormon Church). It is the oldest existing institution within the LDS Church Educational System, is America's largest religious university, and has the second-largest private university enrollment in the United States.<ref></ref><ref>
</ref><ref></ref> Approximately 98% of the 34,000 students at BYU are Mormon; two-thirds of its American students come from outside the state of Utah.<ref></ref>  

BYU students are required to adhere to a strict honor code, which mandates behavior in line with Mormon teachings (including prohibitions on extra-marital sex and the consumption of drugs and alcohol) in addition to academic honesty.  Furthermore, the Honor Code requires BYU students to adhere to a Mormon missionaries, and 32% of BYU women graduates have been missionaries as well.<ref name = mission/>  Many BYU students obtain a level of foreign language proficiency while being Mormon missionaries, and BYU has many foreign language classes.  Over 75% of BYU students have some foreign language proficiency.<ref></ref>
  
The university's primary focus is on master's and 25 doctoral degree programs, including a Juris Doctorate program.  About 70% of student tuition is funded by LDS Church tithing funds, making tuition relatively less expensive than at similar private universities.<ref></ref>

"I hope to see an Academy established in Provo... at which the children of the Latter-day Saints can receive a good education unmixed with the pernicious atheistic influences that are found in so many of the higher schools of the country."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | — Brigham Young, 1875<ref name="dusenberry"/>
|}
BYU's origin can be traced back to 1862 when a man named Warren Dusenberry started a Provo school in a prominent adobe building called Cluff Hall, which was located in the northeast corner of 200 East and 200 North.<ref></ref> On Karl Maeser.<ref name="history"/> The school did not become a university, however, until the end of Benjamin Cluff, Jr's term at the helm of the institution. At that time, the school was also still privately supported by members of the community and was not absorbed and sponsored officially by the LDS Church until July 18, 1896.<ref name="byhigh"></ref> A series of odd managerial decisions by Cluff led to his demotion; however, in his last official act, he proposed to the Board that the Academy be named "Brigham Young University". The suggestion received a large amount of opposition, many members of the Board saying that the school wasn't large enough to be a university, but the decision ultimately passed. One opponent to the decision, Anthon H. Lund, later said, "I hope their head will grow big enough for their hat."<ref name = wilk/>

In 1903, Brigham Young Academy was dissolved, and was replaced by two institutions: Brigham Young High School, and Brigham Young University.<ref name="byhigh">[http://www.byhigh.org/History/HistoryDecades/From1903to1920.html History of Brigham Young High School from 1903 to 1920<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  (The BY High School class of 1907 was ultimately responsible for the famous giant "Y" that is to this day embedded on a mountain near campus.<ref name="byhigh"/>) The Board elected George H. Brimhall as the new President of BYU. He had not received a high school education until he was forty. Nevertheless, he was an excellent orator and organizer.<ref name = wilk/> Under his tenure in 1904 the new Brigham Young University bought 17 acres of land from Provo called "Temple Hill".<ref name="byhigh"/> After some controversy among locals over BYU's purchase of this property, construction began in 1909 on the first building on the current campus, the Karl G. Maeser Memorial.<ref></ref> Brimhall also presided over the University during a brief crisis involving the theory of evolution. The religious nature of the school seemed at the time to collide with this scientific theory. Joseph F. Smith, President of the Church, settled the question for a time by asking that evolution not be taught at the school. A few have described the school at this time as nothing more than a "religious seminary". However, many of its graduates at this time would go on to great success and renown in their fields.<ref name = wilk/>

BYU satellite TV network also opened in 2000 under his leadership. Bateman was also president during the September 11th attacks in 2001. The planes crashed on a Tuesday, mere hours before the weekly devotional normally held at BYU. Previous plans for the devotional were altered, as Bateman led the student body in a prayer for peace.<ref></ref>  Bateman was followed by Cecil O. Samuelson in 2003, who is the current president.<ref></ref>

== Academics ==
===Admissions and demographics===

BYU accepted 74% of the 10,010 people who applied for admission in the summer term and fall semester of 2007.<ref name="Entrance"></ref> The average ACT score and GPA for these admitted students was 27.9 and 3.78, respectively.<ref name="Entrance" /> ''U.S. News and World Report'' describes BYU's selectivity as being "more selective" and compares it with such universities as the Merit Scholars, with 88 in 2006.<ref name = chronicle>The Chronicle of Higher Education, August 31, 2007.</ref> BYU and Harvard University are tied at 79 percent for the highest percentage of accepted applicants that go on to enroll.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kenneth |last=Terrell |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Once College Applicants Are Accepted, Where do They Enroll?

Students from every state in the U.S. and from many foreign countries attend BYU. (In the 2005-6 academic year, there were 2,396 foreign students, or 8% of enrollment.)<ref name = chronicle/> Slightly more than 98% of these students are active members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 2006, 12.6% of the student body represented ethnic minorities, mostly Asian/Pacific islanders and Hispanics.<ref></ref>

===Rankings===
thumb|right|The [[Harold B. Lee Library is consistently ranked among the top ten in the Nation, with a #1 ranking in 2004.]]
In 2008, the ''library is consistently ranked in the nation's top ten--#1 in 2004 and #4 in 2007.<ref></ref>  BYU is also ranked #19 in the ''U.S. News and World Report's'' "Great Schools, Great Prices" lineup, and #12 in lowest student-incurred debt.<ref name = ranks></ref> Due in part to the school's emphasis on undergraduate research, BYU is ranked #8 nationally for the number of students who go on to earn PhDs, #1 nationally for students who go on to dental school, #6 nationally for students who go on to law school, and #10 nationally for students who go on to medical school.<ref>http://news.byu.edu/homepage/mentored.pdf</ref> BYU is designated as a Carnegie research university with high research activity, one of the highest classifications by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.<ref></ref>

The accounting department obtained the "Best in Accountancy" title, according to the Financial Times global ranking of business schools.<ref></ref>  This department has also been highly ranked by the ''Public Accounting Report'' for several years.  This report ranked both the undergraduate and graduate accounting programs second in the nation for the 2006-2007 school year.<ref></ref> ''U.S. News and World Report'' ranked BYU's accounting program third in the nation in their 2008 publication.<ref>U.S. News & World Report, America's Best Colleges 2008</ref>

=== Notable research and awards ===

Scientists associated with BYU have created some notable inventions. BYU College of Engineering.<ref></ref> The Department of open source project.<ref></ref> In May 2008, research by economics professor Joseph Price regarding the effects of child birth order was featured on ''Today''.<ref></ref> In student achievements, BYU Ad Lab teams won both the 2007 and 2008 Rhodes Scholars,<ref></ref> three Gates Scholars in the last four years, and in the last decade has claimed 41 Fulbright scholars and 3 Jack Kent Cooke scholars.<ref></ref>

=== International focus ===

Over three quarters of the student body have some proficiency in a second language (numbering 107 languages in total).<ref name = langfact></ref>  This is partially due to the fact that 45% of the student body at BYU have been missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and many of them learned a foreign language as part of their mission assignment.<ref></ref> During any given semester, about one-third of the student body is enrolled in foreign language classes, a rate nearly four times the national average.<ref name = langfact/> BYU offers courses in over 60 different languages,<ref name = langfact/> many with advanced courses that are seldom offered elsewhere.  Several of its language programs are the largest of their kind in the nation, the Russian<ref name = langvalue>Owens, Eric. America's Best Value Colleges. New York: Princeton Review, 2004. pg.583. ISBN 0375763732</ref> program being one example. The university was selected by the United States Department of Education as the location of the national Middle East Language Resource Center, making the school a hub for experts on that region.<ref name = langvalue/> It was also selected as a Center for International Business Education Research, a function of which is to train business employees in international languages and relations.<ref name = langfact/>
thumb|right|Looking north from the [[Spencer W. Kimball Tower toward Mt. Timpanogos]]
Beyond this, BYU also runs a very large study abroad program, with satellite centers in London, Jerusalem, and Paris, as well as more than 20 other sites.<ref></ref> Nearly 2,000 students take advantage of these programs yearly. In 2001, the Institute of International Education ranked BYU as the number one university in the U.S. to offer students study abroad opportunities.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The BYU Jerusalem Center, which was closed in 2000 due to student security concerns related to the Second Intifada and, more recently, the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, was reopened to students in the Winter 2007 semester.<ref></ref>

A few special additions enhance the language-learning experience. For example, BYU's [http://ic.byu.edu/ International Cinema], featuring films in several languages, is the largest and longest-running university-run foreign film program in the country.<ref></ref> As already noted, BYU also offers an intensive foreign language living experience, the Foreign Language Student Residence.  This is an on-campus apartment complex where students commit to only speak their foreign language of choice while in their apartments.<ref></ref>

=== Academic freedom issues ===

In 1992, the university drafted a new Statement on Academic Freedom,<ref name = acadfree></ref> specifying that limitations may be placed upon "expression with students or in public that: (1) contradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy; (2) deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders; or (3) violates the Honor Code because the expression is dishonest, illegal, unchaste, profane, or unduly disrespectful of others." These restrictions have caused some controversy as several professors have been disciplined according to the new rule. The American Association of University Professors has claimed that "infringements on academic freedom are distressingly common and that the climate for academic freedom is distressingly poor."<ref name=aaupreport></ref>
The new rules have not affected BYU's accreditation, as the university's chosen accrediting body allows "religious colleges and universities to place limitations on academic freedom so long as they publish those limitations candidly," according to associate academic vice president Jim Gordon.<ref name=NascuOnAcademicFreedom></ref>

==Organization==
Brigham Young University is a part of the Church Educational System of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is organized under a Board of Trustees, with the President of the Church as chairman. The President of BYU, currently Cecil O. Samuelson, works in cooperation with the board.<ref></ref> Altogether, BYU has 194 bachelor's degree programs, 68 master's degree programs, 25 Ph.D. programs, and a Juris Doctor program.<ref></ref> These degree programs are overseen by 11 colleges:<ref> pg. 3.</ref>

However, on December 2006, V and W Hall were torn down. The others followed in 2008 with demolition being completed in May 2008.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
thumb|right|Wymount Terrace Student Family Housing.

Wymount Terrace, intended solely for students with young families, contains a total of 462 apartments in 24 buildings.<ref></ref> Another complex originally intended for families is Wyview Park. This recently changed in 2006, when the complex began housing single students as well, in order to counteract loss of singles' housing in other areas.<ref></ref> A unique form of housing on campus is found in the Foreign Language Student Residence (FLSR) complex. The twenty-five apartments in this complex provide housing for students in foreign languages.  Residents of these apartments agree to speak only their apartment's assigned language during the school year while in the apartment. This immersion experience is available in nine languages, and students are accompanied by a native resident throughout the year to enhance the experience.<ref></ref>

Helaman Halls is served by a central cafeteria called the Cannon Center.<ref name = byurooms/> Branches of the BYU Creamery provide basic food and general grocery products for students living in Heritage Halls, Wymount, Wyview, and the FLSR. The store, begun in 1949, has become a BYU tradition and is frequented by visitors to the university and members of the community, as well as students.<ref></ref> It was the first on-campus full-time service grocery store in the country.<ref></ref>
