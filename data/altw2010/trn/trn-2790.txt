==Biography==
===Early life===
Tyner was born in Philadelphia as the oldest of three children. He was encouraged to study piano by his mother. He finally began studying the piano at age 13 and within two years, music had become the focal point in his life. His early influences included Bud Powell, a Philadelphia neighbor. Among many other things, Tyner's playing can be distinguished by a low bass left hand, in which he tends to raise his arm relatively high above the keyboard for an emphatic attack, creating at times a veritable tsunami of sound. Tyner's unique right hand soloing is recognizable for a detached, or staccato quality, and descending arpeggios, both of a triadic shape and in other patterns. His unique approach to chord voicing (most characteristically by fourths) has influenced a wide array of contemporary jazz pianists.

===Early career===
Tyner's first main exposure came with tenor sax, Tyner, bass, and drums, toured almost non-stop between 1961 and 1965 and recorded a number of classic albums, including ''Live at the Village Vanguard'', ''Ballads'', ''Live at Birdland'', ''Crescent'', ''Impulse! label.

Tyner has recorded a number of highly influential albums in his own right. While in Coltrane's group, he recorded a series of important albums (primarily in the piano trio format) for Impulse! Records, starting with the fleet-fingered ''Inception'' (1962), which showcases Tyner's work as a composer.

The pianist also appeared as a sideman in many of the highly acclaimed Blue Note Records albums of the 1960s.

===Post-Coltrane===
After leaving Coltrane's group, Tyner began a series of koto, in addition to piano, flute, and percussion. These albums are often cited as examples of vital, innovative jazz from the 1970s that was neither fusion nor celeste, in addition to his primary instrument, piano. Often cited as a major influence on younger jazz musicians, Tyner still records and tours regularly and played from the 1980s through '90s with a trio that included Avery Sharpe on bass and Aaron Scott on drums. He made a trio of mature yet vibrant solo recordings for Blue Note, starting with ''Revelations'' (1988) and culminating with ''Soliloquy'' (1991). Today Tyner records for the Telarc label and has been playing with different trios, the most recent of which includes Charnett Moffett on bass and Eric Harland on drums.

==Personal life==
Tyner was a Sunni Muslim for a period of time beginning at the age of eighteen. His Muslim name was '''Sulaimon Saud'''. Today Tyner does not practice a specific religion.

McCoy Tyner was also married at one time and has three sons. His brother, American Communist Party. McCoy, however, is not a pronounced advocate of any political ideology.

McCoy Tyner è divenuto famoso per essere stato il pianista di John Coltrane, ma ha anche saputo ritagliarsi una splendida carriera post-coltraniana divenendo uno dei pianisti più influenti del Jazz contemporaneo. Affascinato nei primordi dal pianismo di Bud Powell, Richie Powell e Thelonious Monk, si è creato col passare del tempo uno stile personale capace di dialogare col gruppo o, da solista, suonare come se fosse in gruppo, riempendo gli spazi con note ampie e sostanziose, melodiose e potenti. A inizi carriera, nel 1959, entra nel Jazztet di Art Farmer / Benny Golson, ma dopo sei mesi lo abbandona per unirsi a Coltrane e divenire parte del celebre ed indimenticabile quartetto. Vi resta per cinque anni e incide anche dischi a suo nome per la label Impulse!. Lasciato Coltrane firma per la Blue Note e registra con Joe Henderson e Elvin Jones un grande disco intitolato ''The Real McCoy''. Nel 1972 arriva la definitiva consacrazione: firma per l'etichetta Milestone e registra ''Sahara'' che sarà votato dai critici della rivista Down Beat disco dell'anno. Arriso dal successo gira il mondo in tournèe con il suo gruppo fino al 1978 quando lo abbandona per unirsi ad una band stellare con Sonny Rollins. Gli anni Ottanta e Novanta sono ricchi di soddisfazioni: firma nuovamente con la Blue Note, lavora con il gruppo di All Stars, suona con il suo trio ed incide dischi. Il nuovo millennio lo vede ancora sulla scena in forma di leggenda vivente.
