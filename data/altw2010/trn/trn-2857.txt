}}'''Brisbane Airport'''  is located in the third busiest airport in Sydney and Melbourne airports.

Brisbane Airport has an international terminal, a domestic terminal and a cargo terminal. Both of the passenger terminals have a number of shops and cafeterias.

The airport was awarded the IATA Eagle Award in 2005, the second of only two Australian airports to receive such award. <ref>http://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/2005-05-30-02</ref> Brisbane's $400 million parallel runway project is close to a reality after a dramatic rise in passenger numbers over the last 3 years.<ref></ref> 

Brisbane, along with Sydney Airport, Melbourne Airport and Perth Airport, are having terminal modifications to accommodate the new Airbus A380, The A380 first arrived at Brisbane on November 14, 2005.

Brisbane Airport is accessible by road from Brisbane's Airtrain service that is linked to the Airport Link motorway is planned to connect the Brisbane CBD and airport.

On 18 September 2007, the federal government granted approval for the construction of a new runway at Brisbane airport. The $1 billion new runway will take approximately eight years to construct and will generate about 2,700 jobs. The 3,600-metre runway will operate parallel to the existing main runway at the Brisbane Airport.

==History==
Brisbane's original main airport was Archerfield Aerodrome to the south-west of the CBD. A smaller airstrip existed at Eagle Farm, which was where the Southern Cross first landed in Australia after its trans-Pacific flight in 1928.

During the Second World War Brisbane was the headquarters of the Supreme Commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur. The United States armed forces considerably upgraded Eagle Farm airfield to cater for military flights. After the war this became Brisbane's main civilian airport with many of the original hangars used as passenger and freight terminals, up to the 1980s.

By the 1970s it was clear that the facilities at Eagle Farm were inadequate for a city of Brisbane's size and anticipated growth. The Federal Government announced the construction of a new airport to be built immediately north of Eagle Farm. The new airport was built by Leighton Holdings and opened in 1988.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

The new airport was built on the former Brisbane residential suburb of Cribb Island that was demolished to make way for the airport. Large amounts of sand were pumped from nearby Moreton Bay to bring much of the swampy land above the range of tides.

In 1995 the Australian Federal Government announced it would be selling its airports around Australia. The airport was acquired on a 50 year lease by a consortium of governmental and financial interests led by Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, which now holds the management contract for the facility. In line with Schiphol's overall policy, Brisbane Airport is now at the heart of a master-planned "Airport City" development, being researched in conjuction with QUT.<sup>[http://www.airportmetropolis.qut.com]</sup> The airport is also a partner in the Australia TradeCoast economic development zone. 

Proposals to build a parallel runway eventually (when it is necessary) have been the subject of controversy led by some local politicians. This was a key element of the airport's Master Plan, approved by the Australian Government in 2003. Under Federal Law, developments at major privatised Australian airports do not require approval by local or state planning authorities.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Airports Act 1996|url=http://bar.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aa1996129/|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute
