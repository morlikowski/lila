==History==

'''FC TORREVIEJA – A BRIEF HISTORY'''

In '''Torrevieja''', football started to become popular during the time of the First World War. Although there were no official clubs, local men would clear a field, set up goalposts and play a match. The first official ground was inaugurated in 1920 on a field in what is today called colonia de San Esteban very near to what is now the town’s bus station. In the small plaza behind the station we can see a statue of a footballer to commemorate this fact.

The first reference to '''Torrevieja Club de Futbol''' is in '''1923''' and although there was no official league for them to play in, friendlies and summer cup competitions were arranged against other teams in the Vega Baja region. 

During the Spanish Civil War (1936 – 1939) football, like most things, came to a standstill. It was not until the mid 1950’s that Torrevieja again had an official team, or teams, as Two sides – '''Espanol Frente de Juventudes (known as el Hueso) and Club Deportivo Torrevejense (known as el Remiendo)''' were formed. 

Both the Torrevieja sides continued to play only in friendlies and cup matches and participated in competitions like the “San Pedro Cup” and the '''“Vega Baja Cup”''' without any success to mention. Matches from this period are still remembered with affection in the town with the likes of Murcia, Hercules and Orihuela visiting Torrevieja. Another peculiarity of the times was that there was no admission charged for the match, instead “the hat” was passed round the ground for fans to make whatever contribution they could.

Over the next 15 years both of the Torrevejense clubs folded, leaving a void which was filled in '''1971''' with the foundation of '''Torrevieja Club de Futbol'''. This came about after an appeal by the local press for the formation of a new club as well as a new ground. Football fever was now sweeping the town and the Mayor at the time, Sr. Vicente Garcia Garcia and his administration took on the task to build the football ground we have today. The ground was named (and is still named) the '''Estadio Municipal Vicente Garcia''' (to give the ground it’s full title) and was inaugurated with a match against Hercules Alicante in 1971.

'''Torrevieja CF made their league debut in 1971/72 season''', playing in the Valencian second regional division (two below their current level) and reached Regional Preferente (the level they are currently playing) in 1976. In 1978 the Club achieved '''promotion to the 3rd. Division.''' The whole town threw a massive fiesta as the local club, founded 7 seasons previously had reached the national level within Spanish football. 

Before the season could start, it seems the whole town turned up at the Vicente Garcia  Stadium and helped to extend the terracing around the whole pitch (up to that point only what is now the covered area was developed).

For ten years the club played in Division 3, but on the '''15th of May 1988 Torrevieja CF achieved their greatest success to date by gaining promotion to Division 2B.''' For 5 seasons the club competed in the 2B Division before the financial obligations of competing at this level began to take their toll. Heavily in debt and unable to pay their players or creditors, the club were relegated at the end of the 1993/94 season back to Division 3. Worse was to come as the Spanish FA relegated them a further division (back to Regional Preferente) for failing to meet their financial commitments.

At the same time (1993), a new football club was set up in the town, Club Deportivo Torrevieja. The club played in 2nd Regional. It is this new club which began to climb the football “ladder” and reached Regional Preferente Division in 1996 at the same time that Torrevieja CF dropped down to 2nd Regional Division. Also in '''1996''' the new club adopted its current name '''FC Torrevieja''' and it is this team that today represents the town. After 1 year in Preferente Division, FC Torrevieja achieved '''promotion in 1997 to the 3rd Division''' only to drop back down into Preferente Division 2 years later.

In the 2002/3 season, Restituto (Tuto) Marroqui Ramirez was elected as Club President (Chairman) by the Local Council (FC Torrevieja is a Municipal Club, owned by Torrevieja Council). The new manager would be Vlaho Macan. In his first season a mid table finish was achieved with a squad made up of young local players. It was also at this time that a significant event took place which would affect the Club and the locality in a very positive way. 

In January 2003, at a meeting in the “Total Football Bar” in the Urbanisation San Luis, a group of mainly British fans met and agreed to set up a Supporters Club for FC Torrevieja. This group had been following FC Torrevieja “Home and Away” all season and had helped to increase crowds at the ground from 100 or so to 500. The name chosen for their supporters club was '''“The Torry Army”.''' The first President was Eduardo (Eddie) Cagigao.
