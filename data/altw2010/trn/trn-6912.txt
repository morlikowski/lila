'''Türgi van''' on pärit Türgi idaosas asuva Vani järve äärest.  Vesi tõmbab van'e magnetina ligi: tilkuva kraani all mängimine on üks nende meelistegevusi. Kui aga lasete vanni kassi kehatemperatuurile vastava, 38-kraadise vee, võite oma kassi kerge vaevaga ujuma õpetada. 

Esimene Türgi van toodi Inglismaale 1955. aastal. Ebahariliku karvamustriga - Türgi van'id on muidu üleni valged, ainult saba ja pea on pruunid - kaunid loomad said üsna pea populaarseks. 

Van'il on tugev turjakas keha ja keskmise pikkusega ümarad käpad, kolmnurkne pea, suured kõrvad ja pisut viltused merevaigukarva silmad. Tal on pikk siidjas valge karv, koonul kastanpruunid täpikesed. Kõrvad on valged, seestpoolt merikarbi-roosad nagu ka nina ja käpapajakesed. Keskmise pikkusega saba kaunistavad helepruunid rõngakesed. 

Kuigi van'e peetakse leebeloomulisteks kassideks, on neid esialgu üsna raske kasvatada - "teismeline" van käitub sageli nagu tõeline metslane. Nad vajavad palju tähelepanu ja tegelemist. Tassivad meelsasti asju hammaste vahel - kui kiisul on igav, poetab ta peremehe sülle mingi lelu, nõudes viskamise-tagasitoomise mängu. 

Van'id õpivad ruttu, kuumaverelistele türklastele meeldib, kui nendega räägitakse. Samas ei lase nad ennast süles ühest kohast teise tassida - van'id peavad saama nelja jalaga kindlalt maa peal seista.

The '''Turkish Van''' is a breed of cat native to the rugged mountains of the Lake Van region in Eastern Turkey. Originally called the Turkish Cat,<ref>Rex, Abyssinian and Turkish Cats, by Alison Ashford and Grace Pond, ISBN 0-668-03356-8</ref> the name was changed in 1979 in the U.S. ( 1985  in the U.K.) to Turkish Van<ref>Turkish Van Cat Club newsletter, Van Cat Chat No. 5. Winter 1985/1986</ref> to better distance the breed from the Turkish Angora cat which had its origins around Ankara, in central Turkey. Traditionally, in the cat fancy, Turkish Vans are recognized as patterned cats with color restricted to the head and tail with the body of the cat being white. Historically, in Turkey, solid white is also the color for the Van Kedisi,<ref>Van Kedisi, by Dr. Fuat ODABASIOGLU, University of Veterinary Medicine Fakultesi, Van, Turkey, ISBN 975-97226-0-7</ref> which some consider to be synonymous with the Turkish Van.<ref>Van Kedisi, by Dr. Fuat ODABASIOGLU, University of Veterinary Medicine Fakultesi, Van, Turkey, ISBN 975-97226-0-7</ref>

==Origins==
thumb|left|200px|Van Guzelli Iskenderun, the first registered Turkish Van, was imported from Turkey in 1955 by Laura Lushington
In the ''Complete Cat Encyclopedia'', edited by Grace Pond and published in 1972, Laura Lushington wrote that:
<blockquote>
"One of the two accepted breeds in Turkey, the Van Cat is now known in Britain as the Turkish Cat. Originating in the Lake Van area of southeastern Turkey, these cats have been domesticated for centuries (in fact for as long as the famous Saluki Hound); they are much loved and prized by the Turks for their exceptional character and unique colouring. Apart from their great capacity for affection and alert intelligence, their outstanding characteristic is their liking for water, not normally regarded as a feline attribute. They not only dabble in water and play with it, but have been known to enter ponds and even horse-troughs for a swim – they soon became famous as the 'swimming cats.' I was first given a pair of Van kittens in 1955 while traveling in Turkey, and decided to bring them back to England, although touring by car and mainly camping at the time – the fact that they survived in good condition showed up the great adaptability and intelligence of their breed in trying circumstances. Experience showed that they bred absolutely true. They were not known in Britain at that time and, because they make such intelligent and charming pets, I decided to try to establish the breed, and to have it recognized officially in Britain by the GCCF."
</blockquote>

In the U.S. The International Cat Association, TICA, was the first to accept Turkish Vans for championship status, doing so in 1979.  The Cat Fanciers Association, CFA, followed in 1994. The first successful breeders of Turkish Van in the U.S. were Jack and Barbara Reark who were two of the twelve founding members of TICA. The Rearks imported their first Turkish Vans in 1983.

==Characteristics==
The coat is the most fascinating trait on this cat.  The climate change in Turkey throughout the year seems to have designed the cat's coat over time.  Eastern Turkey is mountainous, and Lake Van sits over 5,260 ft. above sea level.  The area faces such extreme temperatures during the summer and winter seasons that it is almost inhospitable.  The semi–long haired, water resistant single coat, is thick in winter but very soft, like rabbit fur or cashmere. At maturity, the cat will have a winter mane.  During the spring and summer months when Turkey becomes extremely hot, the long hair on the body is shed for a shorter coat that retains the cashmere feel.  The hair on the tail remains long throughout the year and has the appearance of a bottle brush. 

The Turkish Van is a large, semi-longhaired cat with a swimmer's body.  Ideal type should feature broad shoulders with a body that is 'top heavy', that is a cat with its center of gravity forward.  The cat is moderately long and its back legs are slightly longer than its front legs but, neither the cat itself nor its legs are so long to be disproportionate.  These cats are large and muscular and feature short necks - the males can be massive and are considered the football players of the cat world. 

The shoulders of the Turkish Van are broad with the ability for one to place three fingers between the legs at the chest area.  It is said that large Van males are the only domestic cats that cannot follow their heads through a fence due to the broadness of their chest and shoulders.  The rear end on the cat should not exceed the width of the shoulders - in other words, no bell bottomed or pear shape should be seen.

Vans are sometimes confused with Turkish Angoras, although a side-by-side comparison reveals vastly different characteristics.  Angoras are named after Ankara (Angora) and descended separately from the Vans.  Angoras also carry the W gene associated with white fur, blue eyes and deafness while Vans do not.  Van eye color can be amber, blue or odd (one each, amber and blue) but Vans with two blue eyes are not deaf like Angoras. The breed should be thin and nimble and should be very independent to each other.

Turkish Vans are very intelligent, and will easily take over their home and owners. Vans are people cats that want to be with people wherever they go.  They like to play and jump and explore anything in their reach, which is quite large. They are energetic; they play hard and sleep hard.  Many Vans are dedicated to fetching their particular object of interest, and many owners describe them as "dogs in a cat suit" because of their unusual personalities. 

==Breed standards==
The coloring of the Turkish Van should be limited to the head and tail with random body spots acceptable but all color should not exceed more than 20% of the entire cat.  The random spots should not detract from the pattern. This would be a small color cap on the head with a white blaze to at least between the front edge of the ears, and a colored tail in any of the traditional colors.  The rest of the cat is chalk white.  Color can extend up the rump from the tail of the cat and patterned cats often have a random spot or spots of color on the shoulder or body.  This is acceptable as the native people see this as the "Mark of Allah" left when Allah touched the cat to give it his blessing. White Turkish Vans should be solid white if that variety is accepted by their registration association.

The traditional color of a Turkish Van is Red Tabby and White; as this was the first color exported out of Turkey. Later colors added were Cream, Black, Blue, Cream Tabby, Brown Tabby, Blue Tabby, Tortoiseshell, Dilute Tortoiseshell, Brown Torbie, and Blue Torbie.
