O '''eclipsă''' (din greaca veche εκλειψης ''ekleipsis'': ''dispariţie'', ''abandon'') este un eveniment astronomic care are loc atunci când un corp ceresc trece prin umbra altuia.

Termenul este folosit cel mai des pentru a descrie fie o Lunii se proiectează pe suprafaţa eclipsă lunară, când Luna intră în conul de umbră al Pământului. Termenul este folosit şi pentru evenimente de acelaşi fel din afara sistemului Soare-Pământ-Lună; de exemplu, o planetă trecând prin umbra făcută de una din sateliţii proprii, un satelit trecând prin umbra făcută de planeta sa sau un satelit trecând prin umbra altui satelit. Denumirea de „eclipsă solară” este totuşi nefericit aleasă; fenomenul este de fapt acela de ocultaţie.

Întâmplarea face ca Pământul să se afle la o astfel de distanţă de Lună şi de Soare încât diametrele aparente ale celor doi aştri să fie aproximativ egale. Ca urmare, în timpul unei eclipse solare Luna acoperă Soarele aproape perfect. Nu acelaşi lucru se petrecea acum 100 de milioane de ani, când Luna era mai aproape de Pământ; în viitorul îndepărtat se preconizează că toate eclipsele solare vor deveni inelare, adică Luna va acoperi doar partea centrală a Soarelui.

An '''eclipse''' is an astronomical event that occurs when one celestial object moves into the shadow of another. The term is derived from the ancient Greek noun  (''''), from verb  (''''), "I cease to exist," a combination of prefix  (''''), from preposition  (''''), "out," and of verb  (''''), "I am absent".<ref>{{cite web

The term eclipse is  most often used to describe either a solar eclipse, when the Moon's shadow crosses the Earth's surface, or a lunar eclipse, when the Moon moves into the shadow of Earth. However, it can also refer to such events beyond the Earth-Moon system: for example, a planet moving into the shadow cast by one of its moons, a moon passing into the shadow cast by its parent planet, or a moon passing into the shadow of another moon. A binary star system can also produce eclipses if the plane of their orbit intersects the position of the observer.

==Syzygy==

An eclipse occurs when there is a linear arrangement between a star and two celestial bodies, such as a planet and a moon. The shadow cast by the object closest to the star intersects the more distant body, lowering the amount of luminosity reaching the latter's surface. The region of shadow cast by the occulting body is divided into an umbra, where the radiation from the star's photosphere is completely blocked, and a penumbra, where only a portion of the radiation is blocked.<ref name=glossary>{{cite web

A total eclipse will occur when the observer is located within the umbra of the occulting object. Totality occurs at the point of maximum phase during a total eclipse, when the occulted object is the most completely covered. Outside the umbra, the occulting object only partially covers the light source and this produces a partial eclipse. The part of the occulting object's shadow that extends beyond the umbra is called the antumbra. For observer inside the antumbra of a solar eclipse, the Moon appears smaller than the Sun.<ref name=glossary/>

For spherical bodies, when the occluding object is smaller than the star, the umbra forms a cone whose length (''L'') is given by:

:<math>L\ =\ \frac{r \cdot R_o}{R_s - R_o}</math>

where ''R<sub>s</sub>'' is the radius of the star, ''R<sub>o</sub>'' is the occulting object's radius, and ''r'' is the distance from the star to the occulting object. For km, which is much larger than the Moon's semimajor axis of 3.844&nbsp;km. Hence the umbral cone of the Earth can completely envelop the Moon during a lunar eclipse.<ref>{{cite book

 | isbn=0521317797 }}</ref> If the occulting object has an atmosphere, however, some of the luminosity of the star can be refracted into the volume of the umbra. This occurs, for example, during an eclipse of the Moon by the Earth&mdash;producing a faint, ruddy illumination of the Moon even at totality.

An astronomical transit is also a type of syzygy, but is used to describe the situation where the nearer object is considerably smaller in apparent size than the more distant object. Likewise, an occultation is a syzygy where the apparent size of the nearer object appears much larger than the distant object, and the distant object becomes completely hidden during the event.

An eclipse cycle takes place when a series of eclipses are separated by a certain interval of time. This happens when the orbital motions of the bodies form repeating harmonic patterns. A particular instance is the Saros cycle, which results in a repetition of a solar or lunar eclipse every 6,585.3&nbsp;days, or a little over 18 years. However, because this cycle has an odd number of days, a successive eclipse is viewed from a different part of the world.<ref>{{cite web

==Earth-Moon System==
An eclipse involving the Sun, Earth and Moon can occur only when they are nearly in a straight line, allowing the shadow cast by the Sun to fall upon the eclipsed body. Because the orbital plane of the Moon is tilted with respect to the orbital plane of the Earth (the nodes). The Sun, Earth and nodes are aligned twice a year, and eclipses can occur during a period of about two months around these times. There can be from four to seven eclipses in a calendar year, which repeat according to various eclipse cycles, such as the Saros cycle. 

===Solar eclipse===

An eclipse of the Sun by the Moon is termed a solar eclipse. Records of solar eclipses have been kept since ancient times. A Syrian clay tablet records a solar eclipse on March 5, 1223 BCE,<ref>{{cite journal

The type of solar eclipse event depends on the distance of the Moon from the Earth during the event. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Earth intersects the umbra portion of the Moon's shadow. When the umbra does not reach the surface of the Earth, the Sun is only partially occluded, resulting in an annular eclipse. Partial solar eclipses occur when the viewer is inside the penumbra.<ref name="cardall_daunt">{{cite web

Solar eclipses are relatively brief events that can only be viewed in totality along a relatively narrow track. Under the most favorable circumstances, a total solar eclipse can last for 7&nbsp;minutes, 31&nbsp;seconds, and can be viewed along a track that is up to 250&nbsp;km wide. However, the region where a partial eclipse can be observed is much larger. The Moon's umbra will advance eastward at a rate of 1,700&nbsp;km/h, until it no longer intersects the Earth.

During a solar eclipse, the Moon can sometimes perfectly cover the Sun because its apparent size is nearly the same as the Sun when viewed from the Earth. A solar eclipse is actually a misnomer; the phenomenon is more correctly described as an occultation of the Sun by the Moon or an eclipse of the Earth by the Moon.

===Lunar eclipse===

Lunar eclipses occur when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow. Since this occurs only when the Moon is on the far side of the Earth from the Sun, lunar eclipses only occur when there is a full moon. Unlike a solar eclipse, an eclipse of the Moon can be observed from nearly an entire hemisphere. For this reason it is much more common to observe a lunar eclipse from a given location. A lunar eclipse also lasts longer, taking several hours to complete, with totality itself usually averaging anywhere from about 30 minutes to over an hour.<ref>{{cite web

There are three types of lunar eclipses: penumbral, when the Moon crosses only the Earth's penumbra; partial, when the Moon crosses partially into the Earth's umbra; and total, when the Moon circles entirely within the Earth's umbra. Total lunar eclipses pass through all three phases. Even during a total lunar eclipse, however, the Moon is not completely dark. Sunlight refracted through the Earth's atmosphere intersects the umbra and provides a faint illumination. Much as in a sunset, the atmosphere tends to scatter light with shorter wavelengths, so the illumination of the Moon by refracted light has a red hue.<ref>
