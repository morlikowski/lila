'''Robert E. Lee "Bob" Pettit''' (born U.S.) is a retired American professional NBA, all with the Milwaukee/St. Louis Hawks (NBA's Most Valuable Player Award. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971.  He also went by the nickname "Dutch" in college.

==Humble beginnings==
Pettit's basketball career had humble beginnings. At Sheriff of East Baton Rouge Parish (1932-1936), pushed him to practice in the backyard of the Kemmerly house until he improved his skills. It worked: Pettit became a starter as a junior, and led Baton Rouge High to its first State Championship in more than 20 years in his senior year.

==Louisiana State University==
After high school, Pettit accepted a LSU men's basketball team.  (Freshmen were not allowed to play varsity basketball in those days.) During those three years, Pettit averaged 27.8 points per game.  He was also a member of the Zeta Zeta Chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon at LSU.  

Pettit made his varsity debut at LSU in 1952.  He led the SEC in scoring for his first of three consecutive seasons, averaging 25.5 points per game.  He also averaged 13.1 rebounds per game, helped his team to a second-place finish in the league, and was selected to the All-SEC team.

During his junior year, Pettit led the Tigers to their second SEC Title (their first came in 1935) and their first NCAA Final Four. He averaged 24.9 points and 13.9 rebounds per game for the 1953 season.  He was honored with selections to both the All-SEC and All-American teams.

Petit averaged 31.4 points and 17.3 rebounds per game during his senior year and once again led LSU to an SEC Championship and garnered All-SEC and All-American honors.
  
In 1954, his number 50 was retired at LSU. He was the first Tiger athlete in any sport to receive this distinction. In 1999, he was named Living Legend for LSU at the SEC Basketball Tournament. He is a member of the LSU Hall of Fame.  ''Bob Pettit Boulevard'' in Baton Rouge, LA is named after him.

==Pro basketball==
In 1954, the Milwaukee Hawks selected Pettit in the first round of the 13.8 rebounds per game. After this season, the Hawks moved to St. Louis. 

Pettit was moved to forward as a pro. "In college I played the standing pivot," he said in a [http://www.thesportgallery.com/sport-stories/1957apr-pettit.html April 1957 issue of SPORT magazine] interview. "My back was to the basket. In the pros, I'm always outside. Everything I do is facing the basket now. That was my chief difficulty in adjusting, the fact that I had never played forward before."

In his second season, Pettit won his first scoring title with a 25.7 average, and led the league in rebounding (1164 for a 16.2 average). He was also named MVP of the 1958, 1959, and 1962. He also won his first of two NBA regular season MVP awards (the other was in 1959). 

In 1958, Pettit, Ed Macauley and Cliff Hagan led the Hawks to an NBA Championship, defeating the Bill Russell-led Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals (the Hawks had acquired Macauley and Hagan from Boston for the draft rights to Russell).  Pettit put an exclamation point on the Hawks' 110-109 game 6 victory by scoring a then-playoff record of 50 points.   Both teams would also meet in the 1957, 1960 and 1961 Finals, with Boston winning each time.

Pettit's league leading scoring average of 29.2 points per game in the 1958-59 season was an NBA record at the time, that season he was also named as the 1960-61 season, Pettit pulled down 20.3 rebounds per game, making him one of only five players to ever break the 20 rpg barrier.  In the following season, he scored a career best 31.1 points per game.

Rivoluzionò completamente il ruolo di centro, rimanendone tutt'ora uno dei più grandi interpreti mai visti. Fu eletto nella NBA nel 1958, MVP della stagione nel 1956 e nel 1959, ''rookie'' dell'anno 1955.

==Carriera==
===High school e college===

Bob Pettit frequentò la Baton Rouge High School, dove venne escluso dal team di pallacanestro fino al suo anno da junior; nonostante ciò continuò ad allenarsi costantemente, come è capitato frequentemente alle grandi stelle, nel cortile di casa propria. Quando finalmente fu ammesso nella squadra, ne divenne in poco tempo il principale punto di riferimento e, nel suo ultimo, anno la guidò con buona parte del merito, alla vittoria del titolo statale (la prima nella storia della scuola).

Si iscisse, grazie ad una borsa di studio, al locale College di Lousiana State, riscuotendo numerosi successi in termini individuali: in tre anni fu selezionato altrettante volte per la squadra della Southern Conference e due per la All-American; inoltre conlcuse il triennio con una media di 27.8 punti e 14.6 rimbalzi, ben più elevate nella sua ultima stagione.

===NBA===
Al draft 55, Pettit fu la seconda scelta assoluta per mano degli Hawks, franchigia con la quale sarebbe rimasto legato fino al ritiro, che a quel tempo si trovava a Rookie of the Year e la convocazione per l'NBA All-Star Game.
