『'''悪魔の棲む家'''』（'''The Amityville Horror'''）は1974年にロングアイランドのアミティヴィルで実際に起きた超常現象を題材にしたジェイ・アンソン著のベストセラー『アミティヴィルの恐怖』を映画化したホラー映画。1979年製作。2005年にはマイケル・ベイ製作によってリメイクされた。

== ストーリー ==
1974年11月13日、ニューヨーク州ロングアイランドのオーシャンアベニュー112番地の大邸宅でデフェオー一家が惨殺される事件が起こる。犯人は長男のロナルド・デフェオー。

地下室に閉じこもっていたという彼は就寝中の両親と4人の弟妹たちをライフルで次々と射殺。我に返ったロナルドは自ら警察に通報した。逮捕後、彼は「家が家族を殺すよう命じた」と主張したという。

それから1年後、子供たちとの暮らしのために新しい住まいを探していたジョージとキャシーのラッツ夫妻は、その日、新聞広告に載っていたこのアミティヴィルの大邸宅を訪れた。案内した不動産屋はこの邸宅で起きた殺人事件を打ち明けるが、値段の安さにひかれ夫妻は購入を決めた。

引っ越し当日、ラッツ夫妻と3人の子供たちはこれからの生活に心を躍らせるが、その夜からジョージは気分が悪くなりはじめる……。

== オリジナル版とリメイク版の相違 ==
1979年製作のオリジナル版は家に引っ越した一家と並行し、この家の洗礼に訪れた神父も中心人物として描かれており、邸宅で起きたデフェオー一家殺人事件を捜査した刑事が登場するなど全体的に『エクソシスト』のような感じに作られている。

それに対し、2005年製作のリメイク版はこの神父や刑事の存在を排除し、家に引っ越してきた一家が悪霊に蝕まれていく様を中心に描いている。また、オリジナル版では幽霊少女は姿を現さなかったがリメイク版では姿を現しているところや家に越してから態度が豹変してゆくジョージがリメイク版では家の外に出るとその効力がなくなる等の相違が見られる。

== 『アミティヴィルの恐怖』 ==
実話を映画化したという触れ込みの本作だが、ジェイ・アンソン著作のこの原作にはかなりの嘘があることが指摘されている。とはいえ一家惨殺のあった家にラッツ一家が越してきたことや最後の結末は事実である。しかしそれは映画とは違い経済面でのトラブルによるものである。そんな夫妻の前に現れたのが惨殺事件の弁護士であり、彼が夫妻に持ちかけたのが映画の設定にもあった“家に棲みつく悪魔の仕業”にし、一方で夫妻にとって体験談を出版することで多額の収入を得ることが出来るという話であった。そして74年、折りしも『エクソシスト』の公開によりオカルト･ブームが巻き起こり『アミティヴィルの恐怖』はベストセラーとなった。

'''''The Amityville Horror - A True Story''''' is a best-selling book by the author Jay Anson, published in September 1977. The book has also formed the basis of a series of films made between 1979 and 2005.  The story is said to be based on actual paranormal events, but has led to controversy and lawsuits over its truthfulness.<ref>http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/amityville.asp Benjamin Radford writes about ''The Amityville Horror'' for Snopes.com</ref>

==Plot summary==
<!--PLEASE will note that the house is called 412 Ocean Avenue only in the films, see talk page.-->
In December 1975, George and Kathleen Lutz and their children moved into Amityville, a suburban neighborhood located on the south shore of Long Island, New York.  Thirteen months before the Lutzes moved in, Ronald DeFeo, Jr. had shot and killed six members of his family at the house.  After 28 days, the Lutzes left the house, claiming to have been terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there. 

==The book==
:''This section is based on the version of events in Jay Anson's 1977 book '''The Amityville Horror - A True Story'''. '' 
112 Ocean Avenue remained empty for thirteen months after the DeFeo murders. In December 1975, George and Kathleen Lutz bought the house for what was considered to be a bargain price of $80,000. The six-bedroom house was built in malamute/labrador dog named Harry. During their first inspection of the house, the real estate broker told them about the DeFeo murders of the previous November, and asked if this changed their opinion about wanting to buy it. After discussing the matter, they decided that it was not an issue.

The Lutz family moved in on December 23, 1975.  Much of the DeFeo family furniture was still in the house, since it had been included as part of the deal.  A friend of George Lutz learned about the past history of the house, and insisted on having it blessed. At the time, George was a non-practicing Methodist and had no experience of what this would entail. Kathy was a non-practicing Catholic and explained the process. George knew a Catholic priest named Father Ray who agreed to carry out the house blessing. (In Anson's book the priest is referred to as Father Mancuso.  This was done for reasons of privacy and the now-deceased priest's real name was Father Ralph J. Pecoraro).<ref>[http://www.amityvillemurders.com/reference/diocese.html The Amityville Murders' Reference Material<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
 
 
 
 

Father Mancuso was a lawyer, a Judge of the Catholic Court and a psychotherapist who lived at the local Sacred Heart Rectory.  He arrived to perform the blessing while George and Kathy were unpacking their belongings on the afternoon of December 23, 1975, and went in to the building to carry out the rites.  When he flicked the first holy water and began to pray, he heard a masculine voice say clearly ''Get out!''  When leaving the house, Father Mancuso did not mention this incident to either George or Kathy.   On December 24, 1975 Father Mancuso telephoned George Lutz and advised him to stay out of the room where he had heard the unearthly voice telling him to get out.  This was a room on the second floor that Kathy planned to use as a sewing room, and had formerly been the bedroom of Marc and John Matthew DeFeo.  The telephone call was cut dead by static, and following his visit to the house on Ocean Avenue Father Mancuso allegedly developed a high fever and blisters on his hands similar to stigmata.

right|200px|thumb|right|How 112 Ocean Avenue was advertised
At first, George and Kathy Lutz experienced nothing unusual in the house.  Talking about their experiences subsequently, they reported that it was as if they "were each living in a different house." 

Some of the experiences of the Lutz family at the house have been described as follows:

* George would wake up around 3:15 every morning and would go out to check the boathouse. Later he would learn that this was the estimated time of the DeFeo killings.
* The house was plagued by swarms of flies despite the winter weather.
* Kathy had vivid nightmares about the murders and discovered the order in which they occurred, and the rooms where they took place. The Lutzes' children also began sleeping on their stomachs, in the same way that the dead bodies in the DeFeo murders had been found.
* Kathy would feel a sensation as if "being embraced" in a loving manner, by an unseen force.
* Kathy discovered a small hidden room (around four feet by five feet) behind shelving in the basement.  The walls were painted red and the room did not appear in the blueprints of the house. The room came to be known as "The Red Room." This room had a profound effect on their dog Harry, who refused to go near it and cowered as if sensing something negative.
* There were cold spots and odors of perfume and excrement in areas of the house where no wind drafts or piping would explain the source.
* The Lutzes' five year old daughter, Missy, developed an imaginary friend named "Jodie," a demonic pig-like creature with glowing red eyes.
* George would be woken up by the sound of the front door slamming. He would race downstairs to find the dog sleeping soundly at the front door.  Nobody else heard the sound although it was loud enough to wake the house.
* George would hear what was described as a "German marching band tuning up" or what sounded like a clock radio playing not quite on frequency. When he went downstairs the noise would cease.
* George realized that he bore a strong resemblance to Ronald DeFeo, Jr., and began drinking at ''The Witches' Brew'', the bar where DeFeo was once a regular customer.
* While checking the boathouse one night, George saw a pair of red eyes looking at him from Missy's bedroom window.  When he went upstairs to her room, there was nothing to be found. Later it was suggested that it could have been "Jodie".
* While in bed, Kathy received red welts on her chest caused by an unseen force and was levitated two feet off the bed. 
* Locks, doors and windows in the house were damaged by an unseen force.
* Cloven hoofprints attributed to an enormous pig appeared in the snow outside the house on January 1, 1976.
* Green slime oozed from walls in the hall, and also from the keyhole of the playroom door in the attic.
* A 12-inch crucifix, hung in a closet by Kathy, revolved until it was upside down and gave off a sour smell.
* George tripped over a four foot high china lion which was an ornament in the living room, and was left with bite marks on one of his ankles.
* George saw Kathy transform into an old woman of ninety, "the hair wild, a shocking white, the face a mass of wrinkles and ugly lines, and saliva dripping from the toothless mouth."

After deciding that something was wrong with their house that they could not explain rationally, George and  Kathy Lutz carried out a blessing of their own on January 8, 1976. George held a silver crucifix while they both recited the Lord's Prayer, and while in the living room George allegedly heard a chorus of voices telling them “Will you stop?!”

By mid-January of 1976, and after another attempt at a house blessing by George and Kathy, they experienced what would turn out to be their final night in the house.  The Lutzes declined to give a full account of the events that took place on this occasion, describing them as "too frightening."

After getting in touch with Father Mancuso, the Lutzes decided to take some belongings and stay at Kathy’s mother’s house in nearby Deer Park, New York until they had sorted out the problems with the house. They claimed that the phenomena followed them there, with the final scene of Anson's book describing  slime" coming up the staircase towards them. On January 14, 1976 George and Kathy Lutz, with their three children and their dog Harry, left 112 Ocean Avenue leaving most of their possessions behind.  The next day, a mover came in to remove all of the possessions to send to the Lutzes.  He reported no paranormal phenomena while inside the house. <ref>[http://www.ghostvillage.com/legends/2005/legends36_04122005.shtml George Lutz interview - Amityville Horror<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The book was written after Tam Mossman, an editor at the publishing house Prentice Hall, introduced George and Kathy Lutz to Jay Anson.  The Lutzes did not work directly with Anson, but submitted around 45 hours of tape recorded recollections to him which were used as the basis of the book.  Estimates of the sales of the book are around ten million copies from its numerous editions.  Anson is said to have based the title of ''The Amityville Horror'' on ''The Dunwich Horror'' by H. P. Lovecraft, which was published in 1929.

The story of ''The Amityville Horror'' has been continued in a series of books by John G. Jones.  These are ''The Amityville Horror Part II'' (1982), ''Amityville - The Final Chapter'' (1985), ''Amityville - The Evil Escapes'' (1988) and ''Amityville - The Horror Returns'' (1989).  

In 1991, ''Amityville - The Nightmare Continues'' by Robin Karl was published. <ref>[http://chatanuga.org/Amitypt5.html THE HOAX IN AMITYVILLE: PART 5<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Criticisms==

185px|right|thumb|This cover of ''The Amityville Horror'' stresses its claim to be based on fact Much of the controversy surrounding ''The Amityville Horror'' can be traced back to the way that it has been marketed over the years.  The cover of the book shown on the right implies that it is based on verifiable events.  A quote from a review in the ''The Exorcist'' is revealing, since the 1973 film had been a huge box office success and was one of the major cultural events of the 1970s.  Many of the incidents in the book recall the style of ''The Exorcist'', and this is one of the reasons why it has aroused suspicion.

In the afterword of ''The Amityville Horror'' Jay Anson states: "There is simply too much independent corroboration of their narrative to support the speculation that [the Lutzes] either imagined or fabricated these events", but some people remained unconvinced. Almost as soon as the book was published in September 1977, other writers and researchers began looking into the events at 112 Ocean Avenue, and the conclusions that they reached were often at odds with those that had appeared in Anson's book.  

The role of Father Pecoraro in the story has been given considerable attention.  During the course of the lawsuit surrounding the case in the late 1970s, Father Pecoraro stated in an In Search of...'' broadcast in 1980.  ''In Search of...'' was a series of half-hour television documentaries about the paranormal, and was narrated by Leonard Nimoy.  Father Pecoraro's face was obscured during the interview to preserve his anonymity.  In the interview, he repeated the claim that he heard a voice saying "''Get out''", but stopped short of giving it a paranormal origin.  He also stated that he felt a slap on his face during the visit, and that he did subsequently experience blistering on his hands.  As with many areas of ''The Amityville Horror'', the inconsistent accounts given by Father Pecoraro about the extent of his involvement with the Lutz family has led to more questions than answers.

The claims of physical damage to the locks, doors and windows were rejected by Jim and Barbara Cromarty, who bought the house for $55,000 in March 1977.  In a television interview filmed at the house for ''Shinnecock Indians had once abandoned the mentally ill and the dying was rejected by local Native American leaders. <ref>[http://www.amityvillemurders.com/facts.html The Amityville Murders<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
The claim of cloven hoofprints in the snow on January 1, 1976 was rejected by other researchers, since a check on the weather records showed that there had been no snow in Amityville on the day in question. Neighbors reported nothing unusual during the time that the Lutzes were living there.  Police officers are shown visiting the house in the book and 1979 film, but records showed that the Lutzes did not call the police during the period that they were living on Ocean Avenue. <ref>[http://www.prairieghosts.com/amityville.html Amityville: Horror or Hoax?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  There was no bar in Amityville called ''The Witches' Brew'' at the time, and Ronald DeFeo, Jr. was a regular at Henry's Bar, a short distance from 112 Ocean Avenue. 

200px|right|thumb|[[James Brolin, George and Kathy Lutz during an interview on ''Good Morning America'' marking the launch of the first film version in July 1979]]
  
In May 1977 George and Kathy Lutz filed a People'' Magazine, William Weber wrote: "I know this book is a hoax. We created this horror story over many bottles of wine." This refers to a meeting that Weber is said to have had with George and Kathy Lutz, during which they discussed what would later become the outline of Anson's book.  Judge Weinstein also expressed concern about the conduct of William Weber and Bernard Burton relating to the affair, stating: “There is a very serious ethical question when lawyers become literary agents.” <ref>[http://www.amityvillemurders.com/lutzvweber.html The Amityville Murders<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

George Lutz maintained that events in the book were "mostly true" and denied any suggestion of dishonesty on his part.  In October 2000 The History Channel broadcast ''Amityville  - Horror or Hoax?'', a documentary made to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the case.  George Lutz commented in an interview for the program: "I believe this has stayed alive for 25 years because it's a true story.  It doesn't mean that everything that has ever been said about it is true.  It's certainly not a hoax.  It's real easy to call something a hoax. I wish it was. It's not."  George Lutz registered the phrase ''The Amityville Horror'' as a trademark in 2002, and it is referred to as ''The Amityville Horror™'' on his official website.  <ref>[http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78021172 Latest Status Info<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The debate about the accuracy of ''The Amityville Horror'' continues, and despite the lack of evidence to corroborate much of the story, it remains one of the most popular haunting accounts in American folklore.  The various owners of the house since the Lutz family left in 1976 have reported no problems while living there. <ref>[http://www.amityvillemurders.com/history.html The Amityville Murders<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <ref>http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/nevada/2006/may/10/051010103.html</ref>
