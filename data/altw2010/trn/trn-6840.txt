'''Maria Corazon Sumulong Cojuangco''', plus connue sous le nom de '''Corazon Aquino''', et, plus fréquemment encore, sous celui de '''Cory Aquino''' (née le femme politique philippine. Première femme présidente des Philippines du 25 février 1986 au 30 juin 1992.

== Biographie ==

En Concepcion, dans la province de Tarlac.

Son mari fut ensuite élu gouverneur de la province en 1961, puis sénateur en 1967 et, après la mise en place de la loi martiale par le président Ferdinand Marcos en 1972, arrêté, condamné à mort en 1977 et exilé aux États-Unis en 1980 pour « raisons médicales ».

Le assassiné à sa descente d'avion par un soldat prétendu franc-tireur qui était aussitôt opportunément abattu.

S'ensuivit une période de deux ans et demi durant laquelle l'opposition philippine et un large mouvement populaire firent pression sur sa veuve pour qu'elle prenne la tête, à titre de symbole, de l'opposition au régime du président Marcos. Elle se présenta à l'élection présidentielle de février 1986 et, dans la fièvre électorale qui s'ensuivit, il y eut proclamation simultanée de deux vainqueurs le 25 février 1986, chaque camp se prétendant le vainqueur. La manifestation non-violente de plus d'un million de personnes dans l'avenue principale de Manille, le refus de l'armée de prendre position et les manœuvres diplomatiques internationales contraignirent toutefois le président Marcos à prendre à son tour le chemin de l'exil en catastrophe sous la pression populaire. Le palais de Malacañang fut envahi par la foule en liesse.

La neutralité de l'armée philippine, commandée par le général Fidel Ramos, fut probablement déterminante dans l'accession de Cory Aquino à la présidence de la République.

Durant son mandat, une nouvelle constitution fut adoptée en 1987, mais plusieurs tentatives de coup d'État militaires eurent lieu, qui échouèrent toutefois face à la vigilance du général Ramos, resté très proche du nouveau pouvoir.

Le 30 juin 1992, Cory Aquino ne s'étant pas représentée à l'élection présidentielle suivante, Fidel Ramos devenait son successeur, dans une « alternance » tranquille que les Philippines n'avaient pas vue depuis longtemps.

A self-proclaimed "plain housewife",<ref name=fb></ref> Aquino is the widow of Senator 1986 snap presidential elections. After Marcos was proclaimed the winner despite widespread reports of electoral fraud, Aquino was installed as President by the peaceful 1986 People Power Revolution.

==Early life and education==
Corazon Cojuangco was born in Tarlac<ref name=sb/>, a member of one of the richest Chinese-mestizo families in the Philippines.<ref name=pi></ref> She was born to Tagalog in maternal side, one-eighth Kapampangan and one-fourth Spanish in her paternal side, and half-Chinese in both maternal and paternal sides.

She is the fourth among six (6) siblings: Pedro, Josephine Reyes, Teresita Lopa (+), Jose Jr. and Maria Paz Teopaco.  She was sent to St. Scholastica's College and finished grade school as class valedictorian in 1943. In 1946, she studied high school for one year in Assumption Convent Manila, later she was sent overseas to study in Ravenhill Academy in Philadelphia where Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco once studied, the Notre Dame Convent School in New York, and the College of Mount Saint Vincent, also in New York. Aquino worked as a volunteer in the 1948 United States presidential campaign of Republican Thomas Dewey against President Harry Truman.<ref name=sb></ref>  She studied liberal arts and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree major in French Language  and minor in Mathematics in 1953. She had intended to become a math teacher and language interpreter.

==Married life==
thumb|left|150px|Cory Aquino was married to Sen. '''[[Benigno Aquino, Jr.''' from 1954 until his assassination in 1983.]]

Aquino returned to the Philippines to study law at the Speaker of the National Assembly. They had five children together: a son, Benigno Simeon Aquino III, who was elected to the Philippine Senate in 2007, and four daughters, Maria Elena A. Cruz, Aurora Corazon A. Abellada, Victoria Eliza A. Dee, and actress-television host Kristina Bernadette A. Yap. Aquino had initial difficulty adjusting to provincial life when she and her husband moved to American military facility at nearby Clark Field.<ref name=lt> </ref>

A member of the Liberal Party, Aquino's husband rose to be governor of Philippine Senate in 1967. During her husband's political career, Aquino remained a housewife who helped raise the children and played hostess to her spouse's political allies who would frequent their Quezon City home.<ref name=pi/>She would decline to join her husband on stage during campaign rallies, preferring instead to stand at the back of the audience in order to listen to him.<ref name=lt/> Nonetheless, she was consulted upon on political matters by her husband, who valued her judgments enormously.<ref name=pi/>

Benigno Aquino soon emerged as a leading critic of the government of President 1935 Constitution, allowing him to remain in office. Aquino's husband was among those arrested at the onset of martial law, later being sentenced to death. During his incarceration, Aquino drew strength from prayer, attending daily mass and saying three rosaries a day.<ref name=lt/> As a measure of sacrifice, she enjoined her children from attending parties, and herself stopped from going to the beauty salon or buying new clothes, until a priest advised her and her children to instead live as normal lives as possible.<ref name=lt/>

In 1978, despite her initial opposition, Aquino's imprisoned husband decided to run the 1978 Batasang Pambansa elections. Aquino campaigned in behalf of her imprisoned husband and for the first time in her life, delivered a political speech,<ref name=fb/><ref name=lt/> though she willingly relinquished having to speak in public when it emerged that her six-year old daughter Kris was more than willing to speak on stage.<ref name=lt/>

In 1980, upon the intervention of United States President Jimmy Carter,<ref name=fb/> Marcos allowed Senator Aquino and his family leave for exile in the United States. The family settled in Boston, and Aquino would later call the next three years as the happiest days of her married life.<ref name=fb/> He returned without his family to the Philippines on August 21, 1983, only to be assassinated  at the tarmac of the Manila International Airport, which was later renamed in his honor. Aquino returned to the Philippines a few days later and led her husband's funeral rites, where around two million people were estimated to have participated.<ref name=fb/>

==1986 Presidential Campaign==

Aquino participated in many of the mass actions that were staged in the two years following the assassination of her husband. On the last week of November 1985, Marcos unexpectedly announced a snap presidential election to be held in February 1986.<ref></ref> Initially, Senator former president, was seen as the favorite presidential candidate of the opposition, under the  Joaquin "Chino" Roces was not convinced that Laurel could defeat Marcos in the polls.  Roces initiated the Cory Aquino for President Movement to gather one million signatures in one week for Cory to run as president.

Aquino was reluctant at first to run for presidency, despite pleas that she was the one candidate who could unite the opposition against Marcos.<ref name=pi/> She eventually was convinced following a ten-hour meditation session at a Catholic convent.<ref name=sb/> Laurel did not immediately accede to calls for him to give way to Aquino, and offered her the vice-presidential slot under his UNIDO party. Aquino instead offered to give up her affiliation with her husband's political party, the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino, and run under the UNIDO banner with Laurel sliding down to the vice-presidential slot.<ref name=pi/>  Laurel gave way to Aquino to run as President and ran as her running-mate under UNIDO as the main political umbrella of the opposition.

In the succeeding political campaign, Marcos charged that Aquino was being supported by communists and agreed to share power with them, to which she responded that she would not appoint one to her cabinet.<ref></ref> Marcos also accused Aquino of playing "political football" with the United States with respect to the continued United States military presence in the Philippines at Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base.<ref></ref> Marcos also derided Aquino as "just a woman" whose place was in the bedroom.<ref name=fb/>

The elections held on Antique governor Commission on Elections (COMELEC) consistently showed Marcos in the lead, the unofficial tally of the National Movement for Free Elections indicated that Aquino was leading. Despite the job walkout of 30 COMELEC computer technicians alleging election-rigging in favor of Marcos,<ref name=pi/> the Batasang Pambansa, controlled by Marcos allies, ratified the official count and proclaimed Marcos the winner on February 15, 1986.<ref></ref> The country's Catholic bishops and the United States Senate condemned the election<ref name=pi/>, and Aquino called for a general strike and a boycott of business enterprises controlled by Marcos allies.<ref name=bbc></ref> She also rejected a power-sharing agreement proposed by the American diplomat Philip Habib, who had been sent as an emissary by U.S. President Ronald Reagan to help defuse the tension.<ref name=bbc/> 

===Installation as President===

On Defense Minister Armed Forces Vice-Chief of Staff San Juan, Aquino took the presidential oath of office administered by Supreme Court Associate Justice Claudio Teehankee. Marcos himself was sworn into office at Malacañang Palace on that same day, but fled into exile later that night.

==Presidency==

The relatively peaceful manner by which Aquino assumed the presidency through the EDSA Revolution won her widespread international acclaim as an icon of democracy. She was selected as U.S. House Speaker Tip O'Neill hailed as "the finest speech I've ever heard in my 34 years in Congress."<ref name=mss> </ref>

The six-year administration of President Aquino saw the enactment of a new Philippine Constitution and several significant legal reforms, including a new agrarian reform law. While her allies maintained a majority in both houses of Congress, she faced considerable opposition from communist insurgency and right-wing soldiers who instituted several coup attempts against her government. Her government also dealt with several major natural disasters that struck the Philippines, as well as a severe power crisis that hampered the Philippine economy. It was also during her administration that the presence of United States military bases in the Philippines came to an end. 

===Constitutional and law reform===

One month after assuming the presidency, Aquino issued Proclamation No. 3, which proclaimed her government as a revolutionary government. She suspended the 1973 Constitution installed during martial law, and promulgated a provisional “Freedom Constitution” pending the enactment of a new Constitution. <ref></ref> She likewise closed the Batasang Pambansa and reorganized the membership of the Supreme Court. In May 1986, the reorganized Supreme Court declared the Aquino government as “not merely a de facto government but in fact and law a de jure government”, whose legitimacy had been affirmed by the community of nations.<ref></ref>

Aquino appointed 48 members of a Constitutional Commission tasked with drafting a new Constitution. The commission, which was chaired by retired Supreme Court Associate Justice 1987 Constitution was approved in a  national plebiscite in February 1987.
Both the “Freedom Constitution” and the 1987 Constitution authorized President Aquino to exercise legislative power until such time a new Congress was organized.<ref>See Section 1, Article II, Freedom Constitution & Section 6, Article XVIII, 1987 Constitution</ref> She continued to exercise such powers until the new Congress organized under the 1987 Constitution convened in July 1987. Within that period, Aquino promulgated two legal codes that set forth significant legal reforms -- the Family Code of 1987, which reformed the Administrative Code of 1987, which reorganized the structure of the executive branch of government.

In 1991, Aquino signed into law the Local Government Code, which further devolved national government powers to local government units. The new Code enhanced the power of local government units to enact local taxation measures, and assured them of a share of the national internal revenue.

===Agrarian reform===

On July 22, 1987,  Aquino issued Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order 229, which outlined the President’s land reform program, and expanded land reform to sugar lands. Her Republic Act No. 6657, also known as “The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law”. The law authorized the redistribution of agricultural lands to tenant-farmers from landowners, who were paid in exchange by the government capital stock, equity or participation in favor of their workers or other qualified beneficiaries”, in lieu of turning over their land to the government for redistribution. <ref>[http://www.tanggol.org/environmental_laws/RA6657.html Section 31, Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law]</ref>  The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law in 1989, characterizing the agrarian reform policy as “a revolutionary kind of expropriation.”<ref></ref>  

Controversies eventually centered on the landholdings of Aquino, who inherited from her parents  the 6,453 hectare large Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac which was owned through the Tarlac Development Company.<ref name=pdihl></ref> Opting for the stock distribution option under the agrarian reform law, Tarlac Development Company established Hacienda Luisita, Incorporated (HLI) in order to effect the distribution of stocks to the farmer-tenants of the hacienda. Ownership of the agricultural portions of the hacienda were transferred to the new corporation, which in turn distributed its shares of stocks to the farmers.<ref name=pdihl/> The arrangement withstood until 2006, when the Department of Agrarian Reform revoked the stock distribution scheme implemented in Hacienda Luisita, and ordered instead the redistribution of a large portion of the property to the tenant-farmers.<ref></ref> The Department had stepped into the controversy when in 2004, violence erupted over the retrenchment of workers in the Hacienda, eventually leaving seven people dead.<ref name=pdihl/>

===Military insurrections===

From 1986 to 1989, Aquino was confronted with a series of attempts<ref>The Davide Commission Report identified seven such attempts: (1) the July 1986 Manila Hotel incident; (2) the November 1986 "God Save the Queen" plot; (3) the January 1987 GMA-7 incident; (4) the April 1987 "Black Saturday" incident; (5)the July 1987 takeover plot of the Manila International Airport; (6) the August 1987 coup attempt; and (7) the December 1989 coup attempt. </ref> at military interventions by some members of the Noynoy.<ref name=dc200>Davide Commission Report, p. 200</ref>  The seventh and final attempt, which occurred throughout the first week of January, 1989, ended with 99 dead (including 50 civilians) and 570 wounded.<ref>Davide Commission Report, p. 376</ref>
