'''Chesapeake''' is an City of South Norfolk with the former Norfolk County, which dated to 1691. 

Chesapeake is a diverse city with urban areas as well as many square miles of protected forests and wetlands, including a substantial portion of the Great Dismal Swamp. Extending all the way from the rural border with North Carolina to the harbor area of Hampton Roads adjacent to the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth, Chesapeake is located on the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and has miles of waterfront industrial, commercial and residential property. 

It is currently the third largest city in Virginia in terms of population. In 2006, its population was estimated to be 220,560, a 10.7% increase since its 2000 census count [http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51550.html].

==History==
275px|left|thumb|''[[Norfolk County, Virginia (from 1895 map), existed from 1691-1963, now extinct'']] 
In 1963, the new South Norfolk consolidated with Norfolk County. The consolidation, authorized by the Virginia General Assembly, was approved and the new name selected by the voters of each communities by referendum. The new city joined the ranks of the current Seven Cities of Hampton Roads which are linked by the circumferential Hampton Roads Beltway.       

Formed in 1691 in the Norfolk, Portsmouth, and South Norfolk, but had seen its area frequently reduced as these cities added territory through annexations after 1871. Becoming an independent city was a method for the former county to stabilize borders with neighbors, as cities could not annex territory from each other. 

The relatively small City of South Norfolk had been Incorporated as a town in 1919, and became an independent city in 1922. It was also motivated to make a change which would put it on a more equal footing in other aspects with the much larger cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth. By the late 1950s, although immune from annexation by the bigger cities, the most recent suit by Norfolk against Norfolk County would have taken all of the county land adjoining South Norfolk.  

The changes which created Chesapeake were part of a wave of changes in the structure of local government in southeastern Virginia which took place between 1952 and 1976.

Chesapeake's history goes far back into Virginia's colonial roots. The Great Bridge where the locks transition from the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River to the Colony of Virginia during the early days of the American Revolution on December 9, 1775.

The Deep Creek section of the city branching off from the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River. The canal runs through Chesapeake paralleling U.S. Highway 17 into North Carolina and connects to Elizabeth City, North Carolina.

Until the late 1980s and early 1990s, much of Chesapeake was either suburban or rural, serving as a Norfolk and Virginia Beach with residents commuting to these locations. Beginning in the late 1980s and accelerating in the 1990s, however, Chesapeake saw significant growth, attracting numerous and significant industries and businesses of its own. This explosive growth quickly led to strains on the municipal infrastructure, ranging from intrusion of saltwater into the city's water supply to congested roads and schools.

Chesapeake made national headlines in 2003 when, under a court-ordered Beltway sniper death sentence, choosing a sentence of "life in prison without parole" instead for the young man, who was 17 years old at the time of the crime spree. A jury in neighboring Virginia Beach sentenced his older partner John Allen Muhammad to death for another of the attacks.

In the summer of 2005, after receiving complaints, the Chesapeake Public Library removed a painting by Virginia state flag also displays a female figure with a bare breast.

In 2006, Ford Motor Company announced it was closing its automotive assembly plant in Norfolk, near the city line with Chesapeake, as part of a consolidation of its manufacturing facilities.

===Diverse environment===
Chesapeake is one of the larger cities in Virginia and the nation in terms of land, a fact that poses challenges to city leaders in supporting a large infrastructure. The presence of many historically and geographically distinct communities also poses challenges to city leaders, who are also faced with conflicts between development of residential, commercial and industrial areas and preservation of virgin forest and wetlands. Within the city limits in the southwestern section is a large portion of the Great Dismal Swamp.
