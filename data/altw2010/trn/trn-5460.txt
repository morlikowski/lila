Le sociologue, à l'aide de méthodes d'observation rigoureuses : enquêtes de terrain, statistiques, sondages, études de documents historiques ou de journaux, cherche à expliquer l'organisation et l'évolution des sociétés et à comprendre les phénomènes sociaux. Il s'intéresse aux relations entre les individus et les groupes, aux mœurs, aux institutions et organisations, aux opinions et aux comportements...

Toutefois, cet article recense les '''<u>contributeurs majeurs</u> à la sociologie''' y compris dans le cas où ils n'exercent pas comme sociologues.
