'''''The Yankee Doodle Mouse''''' is a 1943 one-reel short produced by Fred Quimby and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, with musical supervision by Scott Bradley and animation by Irven Spence, Pete Burness, Kenneth Muse and George Gordon. Jack Zander is uncredited. It was produced in Technicolor and released to theatres on June 26 1943 by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer.

The short features Tom and Jerry chasing each other in a pseudo-Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons, making it the first of seven ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons to receive this distinction.

==Plot==
In a cellar, Jerry is pursued by Tom, rushing into his "Cat Raid Shelter" as he calls his mousehole. Tom peers into the hole, in frustration. Jerry launches a tomato from a mousetrap, which goes splat into Tom's face. Jerry climbs up the wall and grabs a handful of "Hen-Grenades" (eggs). As Tom wipes the tomato off his face, he is promptly covered in egg. Jerry reaches a case of champagnes and shoots off the corks, hitting Tom in the face and sending him into a tub of water, floating in a pot. Jerry launches a brick from a spatula, which crashes into the pot, sinking the cat.

A communique reads '''"Sighted cat - sank same. Signed, Lt. Jerry Mouse."'''

Later on, Jerry observes Tom through a makeshift plumbing pipe acting as a periscope. Tom approaches Jerry's mousehole, mallet in hand. Jerry is on the ball, however, and opens the ironing board cupboard, which causes the board to land on Tom. The mouse charges down the board in a makeshift jeep (which is actually a cheese grater attatched to a roller-skate), tearing Tom's fur as the grater speeds past him. However, Jerry's jeep crashes into a wall, sending a sack of flour tumbling down. Jerry grabs the sack and sends flour throughout the room as a smokescreen. Tom can barely see through the flour, and Jerry, who can see (as the flour begins just above his head), repeatedly smacks Tom in the rear with a board from behind him. Eventually, however, Tom lands facing the mouse, and Jerry's eyes pop out before Jerry slaps Tom a fourth time anyway.

Tom, wearing a bowl for a helmet, throws a stick of dynamite towards Jerry, who immediately throws it back to Tom. The lit firecracker exchanges hands repeatedly until Jerry takes it from Tom, tricking the cat into trying to hold onto it instead of keeping it away. They snatch it away from each other until Tom steals it one last time with a firm stare, and holds it in his hand, until it explodes.

Jerry jumps into a kettle, which Tom approaches and throws another firecracker in. Jerry panics, but it fails to explode due to lack of hair, and the mouse escapes through the spout. The puzzled cat opens the kettle lid and sticks his entire head in. With the kettle exposed to air, the firecracker goes off, leaving Tom in blackface, with a flower appearance.

Tom launches a paper airplane with a firecracker hidden on top, but Jerry blows it back and it lands beneath Tom, exploding once again.

『'''勝利は我に'''』（しょうりはわれに、原題：'''The Yankee Doodle Mouse'''、劇場公開時『'''星条旗よ永遠にの巻'''』）は短編作品のひとつ。

1943年6月26日公開。1944年、アカデミー短編アニメ賞受賞作品。

初のアカデミー賞受賞作品だが、この作品が封切りされた当時、戦時中であったためトムとジェリーが戦争ごっこをするというその全作品の中で唯一戦時色が強い作品となっている。
