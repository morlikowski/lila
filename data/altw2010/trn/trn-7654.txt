'''The Smiths''' var en britisk rockgruppe, der eksisterede mellem 1982 og 1987. Gruppens frontfigurer var Steven Patrick Morrissey (er som oftest blot kendt som Morrissey), der var forsanger og sangskriver, og Johnny Marr der var guitarist og komponerede gruppens sange. Resten af gruppen bestod af Mike Joyce og Andy Rourke.

The Smiths tog kraftig inspiration fra både 60'ernes britiske popmusik og deres samtids punk og new wave. I modsætning til de fleste andre 80'er grupper spillede keyboards ikke nogen særlig stor rolle. Gruppen havde en speciel "anti-rock"-lyd, der har gjort dem til forbillede for mange indie- og britpopbands. Meget vigtigt for gruppen var Morrissey's tekster, der rummede mange kontraster: følsomhed, depression, samfundskritik, outsidermentalitet og selvironi. The Smiths fik straks ved deres debut i 1984 en del opmærksomhed, og musikmagasinet NME skamroste deres debutsingle "Hand in Glove". Deres andet album ''Meat is Murder'' gik ind den engelske hitliste som nr. 1 straks ved udgivelsen. Udover anmelderroserne forstod gruppen at holde sig i rampelyset, da Morrissey ofte har været provokerende i såvel interviews som sangtekster (han er vegetar og lever i cølibat). Med ''The Queen is Dead'' i 1986 opnåede gruppen ifølge mange kritikere et kunstnerisk højdepunkt, men med ''Strangeways, Here We Come'' kom gruppen i en krise, der ledte til gruppens opløsning. På dette tidspunkt var The Smiths ét af Storbritaniens mest populære rockgrupper, med en særdeles hengiven fanskare. The Smiths høres stadig af mange, og er, på trods af deres kommiercielle succes, kendt som et af de vigtigste bands inden for alternativ rock og indiepop takket være Morrissey's intelligente og ligefremme tekster om livet som outsider.

== Historie ==
 
Bandet bliver dannet i foråret 1982 af Morrissey (født Steven Patrick Morrissey d.22/5- 1958) og Johnny Marr. Morrissey var en arbejdsløs skribent, som var fan af New York Dolls og som kort tid havde været front figur i punk bandet The Nosebleeds(bl.a. sammen med guitaristen Billy Duffy). Johnny Marr (oprindelig John Maher, han ændrede sit navn for at undgå forveksling med navnebroderen og trommeslager i Buzzcocks)var en meget dygtig guitarist med talent for sangskrivning. I The Smiths er han manden bag musikken, som gennem fem år ledsagede Morrisseys tekster. Mike Joyce blev hyret som trommeslager efter en kort audition. Dale Hibbert spillede bas i starten, han gav også bandte mulighed for at indspille en demo, da han sideløbende arbejdede som lydmand i et lokalt studio. Dog forlader han bandet efter to koncerter, hvorefer Marrs ven Andy Rourke overtager pladsen som bassist. Marr og Rourke havde bl.a. arbejdet sammen bandet The Paris Valentinos.

Årsagen til bandets navn er stadig uklar, men det er dog blevet sagt at være en reaktion mod navne som fx Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark og Depeche Mode. Det siges også at navnet var en hyldest til digteren og sangeren, Patti Smith, en af Morrisseys idoler, eller Mark E. Smith fra The Fall, eller Myra Hindleys svigersøn, David Smith, som oplyste om de såkaldte "Moors Murderers"(Ian Brady og Myra Hindley som mellem 1963 og 1965 begik fem mord på børn. Fire af ofrene blev begravet i Manchesters omkringliggende heder(moor)). En anden teori foreslår, at bandets navn var en ironisk joke; at navngive et typisk engelsk kligende navn, når alle bandmedlemmerne var af irsk herkomst. I modstrid med det sidstnævnte sagde Morrissey i et interview fra 1984 om navnet: "Jeg besluttede, at kalde os for The Smiths fordi det var det mest almindelig navn, og jeg synes at det er tid for de almindelige mennesker i verden viser deres ansigter". Bandet overvejede også navnene "Smiths Family" og "Smithdom" før de holdte fast i navnet The Smiths.

I 1983 skriver bandet under på en kontrakt med selskabet Rough Trade Records, og udgiver deres første single "Hand in Glove," d 13 maj. Den plade, såvel som alle deres senere singler, blev "championed" af radioværten, John Peel, men den nåede ikke på hitlisten. Efterfølgererne "This Charming Man" og "What Difference Does It Make?"klarede sig dog meget bedre. Hjulpet på vej af musikpressen og en række studio sessions for John Peel og David Jensen på BBC Radio 1, begyndte The Smiths at opnå en flok tro tilhængere - hvilket, specielt i forbindelse med Morrissey efterhånden næsten bliver kultisk.

'''The Smiths''' were an English rock band active from 1982 to 1987, based on the songwriting partnership of singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr. Critics have called them one of the most important alternative rock bands to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s,<ref>Reynolds, Simon. ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984''. Penguin, 2005. p. 392</ref><ref>Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:q2jm7i6jg77r~T0 The Smiths]". ''Allmusic''. Retrieved August 9, 2006.</ref> and the group has had major influence on subsequent artists. Morrissey's lovelorn tales of alienation found an audience amongst youth culture bored by the ubiquitous synthesizer-pop bands of the early 1980s, while Marr's complex melodies helped return guitar-based music to popularity.<ref>[http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?reviewid=8449 Sputnikmusic.com]</ref> 

The group were signed to the independent record label Rough Trade Records, for whom they released four studio albums and several compilations, as well as numerous non-LP singles. Although they had limited commercial success outside the UK while they were still together, and never released a single that charted higher than number 10 in their home country, The Smiths won a growing following, and they remain cult and commercial favourites.

==History==
===Early history===
The Smiths were formed in early 1982 by two Steven Patrick Morrissey (he had not yet abandoned his first names) who was a big fan of the jangly The Fall, demo recording facilities at the studio where he worked as a Kevin Kennedy.<ref></ref>

''Encyclopedia Britannica'' comments that the band's "non-rhythm-and-blues, whiter-than-white fusion of 1960s rock and postpunk was a repudiation of contemporary dance pop" which was popular in the early 1980s<ref name="britannica">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/549957/the-Smiths#ref=ref666407&tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&title=the%20Smiths%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia Britannica Online: "the Smiths"]</ref>. The band also picked their name in part as a reaction against names used by popular Synthpop bands of the early 1980s, such as Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Spandau Ballet, because they considered these names fancy and pompous.In a 1984 interview Morrissey stated that he chose the name The Smiths "...because it was the most ordinary name" and because he thought that it was "...time that the ordinary folk of the world showed their faces."<ref></ref>  Signing to indie label Rough Trade Records, they released their first single, "Hand in Glove", on 13 May 1983. The record was championed by DJ John Peel, as were all of their later singles, but failed to chart. 

The follow-up singles ""kitchen sink" television plays, Morrissey wrote about ordinary people and their experiences with despair, rejection and death. While gloomy "...songs such as “Still Ill” sealed his role as spokesman for disaffected youth", Morrissey's  "manic-depressive rants" and his "“woe-is-me” posture inspired some hostile critics to dismiss the Smiths as “miserabilists.”"<ref name="britannica"/>

The group also had a distinctive visual style on their album and single covers, which often featured colourful images of film and pop stars, usually in Warhol protégé Joe Dallesandro, James Dean), figures from 1960s British culture (Viv Nicholson, Pat Phoenix, Yootha Joyce, Shelagh Delaney), or images of unknown models taken from old films or magazines.  

The Smiths dressed mainly in ordinary clothes – jeans and plain shirts – which reflected the "back to basics" guitar-and-drums style of the music. This contrasted with the exotic high-fashion image cultivated by The Face'' and ''i-D''. Morrissey once wore a fake hearing aid to support a hearing-impaired female fan who was ashamed of using one,<ref>''Morrissey & Marr: The Severed Alliance'' by Johnny Rogan</ref> and thick-rimmed National Health Service-style eyeglasses.

===''The Smiths''===
By February 1984, The Smiths' fanbase was sufficiently large to launch the band's eponymous debut album to number two in the UK chart. Its mood was generally bleak, exemplified by such track titles as "Flesh''. Both "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" met with controversy, supposedly being suggestive of pub jukebox, and at first thought that the band was trying to commercialise the murders. After meeting with Morrissey, he realised that the song was a sincere exploration of the impact of the murders. Morrissey subsequently established a friendship with Ann West, the mother of victim Lesley Ann Downey, who is mentioned by name in the song.

The released debut album followed a scrapped full-length version of the album recorded between July and August 1983 by producer Troy Tate. This collection, with its numerous variations from the final released version, is known as the "Troy Tate Sessions" and is a rarity. The planned single, "Jeane," was retained as a B-side for the "This Charming Man" single.<ref>Simon Goddard, ''The Smiths: The Songs That Saved Your Life'', Reynolds & Hearn Ltd, pp. 46-53.</ref> Shortly after the release of the album, Morrissey idol Sandie Shaw recorded "Hand in Glove" backed by Marr, Rourke and Joyce. The hit single resulted in the band performing barefoot (a Sandie Shaw trademark) on ''Top of the Pops''. 

In 1984, the band released several singles not taken from the album: "Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now" (the band's first top-ten hit; the title parodies Sandie Shaw's 1960s hit "Heaven Knows I'm Missing Him Now") and "William, It Was Really Nothing" (which featured "How Soon Is Now?" as a B-side). The year ended with the compilation album ''Hatful of Hollow''. This collected singles, B-sides and the versions of songs that had been recorded throughout the previous year for the Peel and Jensen shows. The radio session versions were felt by many (including the band) to be better than those released as singles and on the debut album.

===''Meat Is Murder''===

Early in 1985 the band released their second album, ''LP, it has been added to subsequent releases. ''Meat Is Murder'' was the band's only album (barring compilations) to reach number one in the UK charts.

Morrissey brought a political stance to many of his interviews, courting further controversy. Among his targets were the Thatcher government, the monarchy and the famine relief project Band Aid. Morrissey famously quipped of the latter, "One can have great concern for the people of Ethiopia, but it's another thing to inflict daily torture on the people of England."<ref></ref> The subsequent single-only release "Shakespeare's Sister" was not a chart success, nor was the only single taken from the album, "That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore", which barely cracked the top 50. 

===''The Queen Is Dead''===

During 1985 the band completed lengthy tours of the UK and the US while recording the next studio record, ''Spin'' magazine rated ''The Queen Is Dead'' as number one of "The Greatest Albums Ever Made". Subsequent "Greatest Albums" lists by numerous music publications have placed the album at the top or within the top ten, including those of ''NME'' and ''Melody Maker''. In June 2006, ''NME'' dedicated an entire issue to the twentieth anniversary of the record's release. 

However, all was not well within the group. A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr was beginning to feel the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. He later told ''NME'', "'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: I was extremely ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit... dangerous. I was just drinking more than I could handle."<ref></ref> Meanwhile, Rourke was fired from the band in early 1986 due to his use of Panic"  and "Ask" (with Kirsty MacColl on backing vocals), and toured the UK. After the tour ended in October 1986, Gannon left the band.

===''Strangeways, Here We Come''===
thumb|The Smiths performing "[[Shoplifters of the World Unite" on ''Top of the Pops'' in 1987.]]
In early 1987 the single "Shoplifters of the World Unite" was released to chart success, as well as mild controversy and concern from parents. It was followed by a second compilation, ''The World Won't Listen'' (the title was Morrissey's comment on his frustration with the band's lack of mainstream recognition, although the album reached number two in the charts), and the single "Sheila Take a Bow", the band's second (and last during the band's lifetime) UK top-10 hit. Another compilation, ''Louder Than Bombs'', was intended for the overseas market and covered much the same material as ''The World Won't Listen'', with the addition of "Sheila Take a Bow" and material from ''Hatful of Hollow'', as that compilation was yet to be released in the U.S. 

Despite their continued success, personal differences within the band — including the increasingly strained relationship between Morrissey and Marr — saw them on the verge of splitting. In August 1987, Marr left the group, and auditions to find a replacement for him proved fruitless. By the time ''Twinkle and Cilla Black. Referring to the songs recorded in the band's last session together (B-sides for the "Girlfriend in a Coma" single, which preceded the album's release), Marr said "I wrote 'I Keep Mine Hidden', but 'Work Is a Four-Letter Word' I hated. That was the last straw, really. I didn't form a group to perform Cilla Black songs."<ref></ref> In a 1989 interview, Morrissey said that the lack of a managerial figure and business problems were to blame for the band's eventual split.<ref>[http://www.morrissey-solo.com/content/interview/greenscene Morrissey-Solo.com]</ref>

''Strangeways'' peaked at number two in the UK but was only a minor US hit, although it was more successful there than the band's previous albums. The track "Paint a Vulgar Picture" foretold how the group's songs would be "reissued and repackaged" in seemingly innumerable compilations. The 30-second video for "Girlfriend in a Coma" garnered video rotation on MTV in America. The album received a lukewarm reception from critics, but all four members name it as their favourite Smiths album. A couple of further singles from the album were released with earlier live, session and demo tracks as B-sides, and the following year the live album ''Rank'' (recorded in 1986 while Gannon was in the band) repeated the UK chart success of previous albums.

===Post-Smiths careers===

Following the group's demise, Morrissey began work on a solo recording, collaborating with ''Strangeways'' producer Stephen Street and fellow Mancunian Vini Reilly, guitarist for The Durutti Column. The resulting album, ''Viva Hate''  (a reference to the end of the Smiths), was released six months later, reaching number one in the UK charts. Morrissey continues to perform and record as a solo artist.

Johnny Marr returned to the music scene in 1989 with Pet Shop Boy supergroup Electronic. Electronic released three albums over the next decade. Marr was also a member of Oasis album ''Heathen Chemistry''. 

He performed two Smiths songs and music by others with a supergroup consisting of members from Isaac Brock on songs that eventually featured on the band's 2007 release, ''We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank''. The band subsequently announced that Marr was a fully fledged member, and the reformed line-up toured extensively throughout 2006-07. Marr has also been recording with Liam Gallagher of Oasis. In January 2008, Marr had reportedly been adding his skill and experience to a secret songwriting session with Wakefield indie group The Cribs. Sources reveal that they worked together for a week at Moolah Rouge recording studio in Stockport - a favourite haunt of Bolton's Badly Drawn Boy, Damon Gough and fellow northern indie heroes I Am Kloot - and have penned a number of new songs.<ref>[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/music/rock_and_pop/s/1033883_marr_rocking_the_cribs "Marr rocking the Cribs", Manchester Evening News, 26 January 2008]</ref> He also played at the Glasgow Barrowlands, Manchester Academy, Oxford Academy, Bristol Carling Academy, Leeds University, Cardiff University and Brixton Carling Academy with The Cribs on the NME Awards Tour. On 23 February 2008 XFM reported that Marr was to become a full member of The Cribs. On 28 February 2008 he also played onstage with The Cribs at NME Big Gig at the O2.

Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce have continued working together, including doing session work for Morrissey (1988–89) and Mani (of The Stone Roses and Primal Scream). He has recently started a radio career, hosting a show on Saturday evenings on XFM Manchester.
