'''Meditações''' (em grego Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν, ''Ta eis heautón'' literalmente "[pensamentos/escritos] endereçados a si mesmo") é o título de uma série de escritos pessoais do estóica.

Marco Aurélio escreveu os doze livros das Meditações em grego, como uma fonte para sua própria orientação e para se melhorar como pessoa. É possível que grandes partes da obra tenham sido escritas em Hron), e o terceiro livro foi escrito em Carnunto. Não se sabe ao certo se ele teve a intenção de publicar seus escritos, e o título "Meditações" é apenas o mais célebre dentre diversos outros comumente designados à coleção. A obra segue o formato de citações, que variam em tamanho, de uma frase à parágrafos longos.

Suas idéias estóicas frequentemente giram em torno da negação de uma emoção, de uma habilidade, que, segundo o autor, libertarão o homem das dores e dos prazeres do mundo material. A única maneira de um homem ser atingido pelos outros seria se ele permitisse que sua reação tomasse conta de si. Marco Aurélio não mostra qualquer fé religiosa em particular nos seus escritos, mas parecia acreditar que algum tipo de força lógica e benevolente organizasse o universo de tal maneira que até mesmo os acontecimentos "ruins" ocorressem para o bem do todo.

'''''Meditations''''' (Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν, ''Ta eis heauton'', literally "thoughts/writings addressed to himself") is the title of a series of personal writings by Marcus Aurelius setting forth his ideas on Stoic philosophy.

Marcus Aurelius wrote the twelve books of the ''Meditations'' in Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement.  It is  possible that large portions of the work were written in Sirmium, where he spent much time planning military campaigns from 170 to 180. We know that some of it was written while he was positioned at Aquincum on campaign in Pannonia, because internal notes tell us that the second book was written when he was campaigning against the Quadi on the river Granova (modern-day Hron) and the third book was written at Carnuntum. It is not clear that he ever intended the writings to be published, so the title ''Meditations'' is but one of several commonly assigned to the collection. These writings take the form of quotations varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs. 

His stoic ideas often revolve around the denial of emotion, a skill which, he says, will free a man from the pains and pleasures of the material world. He claims that the only way a man can be harmed by others is to allow his reaction to overpower him. He shows no particular religious faith in his writings, but seems to believe that some sort of logical, benevolent force organizes the universe in such a way that even "bad" occurrences happen for the good of the whole.
