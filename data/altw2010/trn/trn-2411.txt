== Plot ==
Dwight Arno (drives on. To Lucas, who has a minor injury, Dwight lies that they collided with a block of wood. He hears in the news that the boy died. 

Dwight tries to cover up the evidence that he did it: he parks his car, which has some damage, in the garage and rents another car.  He lies to the police that he gave the car to a charity some time ago. When Lucas recalls in passing that Josh's death was on the same day as their trip, Dwight lies that these were a week apart.

After the initial shock Grace gradually tries to get on with life as normally as possible, but her husband Ethan (Joaquin Phoenix) 
is obsessed with finding out who killed his son, and frustrated with the lack of progress the police makes in the investigation. This causes much friction between the couple. Ethan hires a lawyer, who happens to be Dwight.

Out of guilt Dwight decides to turn himself in. At the police station he is at the point of telling the truth, but the police officer thinks he has come as Ethan's lawyer, admits that there is little chance they find the perpetrator, and gives him papers with details about the investigation, and, being in a hurry, leaves. These factors make it possible and tempting for Dwight to refrain from telling the truth after all, and so he does.

Uncomfortably Dwight encounters Ethan also in his leisure time: when he comes to Ruth's house to get Lucas for the weekend, Ethan is there to collect his daughter, who gets piano lessons from Ruth. Guilt-ridden, Dwight plans again to confess. In anticipation of going to jail later, Dwight asks Ruth to have Lucas for a week, saying he has to go away for some time afterwards. She is reluctant, but Dwight begs her in tears, saying that Lucas is all he has left. After seeing how desperately he wants this she agrees.
