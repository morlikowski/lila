'''Danbury''' is a Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. It has an estimated population as of July 1, 2005 of 78,736.<ref name=popest2/> 

The city was named for the place of origin of many of the early settlers, Danbury, Essex in England. Its nickname is ''Hat City'' because it used to be a center of the hat industry, at one point producing 25% of America's hats. 

Danbury is also the site of a low-security women's prison, the Danbury Federal Correctional Institute<ref>[http://www.federalprison.com/federalprison/html/D%20Fed%20Prison%20Facility%20Info.html Danbury's low-security women prison], by  Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Facilities, Retrieved November 17, 2006</ref>
<!--formerly a men's prison. Notable ex-prisoners include cocaine dealer and trafficker of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, and hotel magnate Leona Helmsley. James Michael Curley, mayor of Boston from 1945-1949, spent five months of his mayoral term at Danbury Federal Prison, after he was convicted on federal charges of official misconduct. Media personality and homemaker Martha Stewart and female rap star 'Lil Kim requested that their prison terms be served at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute due to its' proximity to their New York City homes. However, due to the media attention their requests were denied.-->.

Danbury is home to Danbury Hospital and Danbury High School.

== History ==

Danbury was first settled by colonists in 1685, when eight families moved to the area from the area that is now Norwalk and Stamford.  The area was then called ''Paquiaqe'' by the Native Americans. One of the first settlers was Samuel Benedict who bought land from the Paquioque natives in 1685 along with his brother James, James Beebe, and Judah Gregory. The settlers originally chose the name '''Swampfield''' for their town, but in October 1687, the general court decreed the name Danbury.

During the -27, 1777, the British under Major General William Tryon burned and looted the city. The central motto on the seal of the City of Danbury is ''Restituimus'' (Latin for "We have restored"), a reference to the destruction caused by the Loyalist army troops.  The American General David Wooster was mortally wounded near the city of Ridgefield, Connecticut at the Battle of Ridgefield by these same British forces which had earlier attacked Danbury.  He is buried in Danbury's Wooster Cemetery, and the private Wooster School in Danbury is named in his honor. <ref>[http://www.danburyhistorical.org/Wooster.html Danbury Histrical Society web site]</ref>

In 1780, the first hat factory in Danbury was established by Zadoc Benedict, employing three workers and producing 18 hats a week. Danbury was known as "The Hat City" or the "Hatting Capital of the World" during the early 20th Century.

In 1802, Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association, a religious group, in which he used the expression "Separation of Church and State".  It is the first known instance of the expression, which does not appear in the U.S. Constitution, contrary to popular belief. (This letter is on display at the Unitarian-Universalist Congregation of Danbury.)

The first Danbury Fair was held in 1821.  By 1869, it became a yearly event and was held until 1981. After 1981, the fairgrounds were demolished to make room for the Danbury Fair Mall, which opened in the fall of 1986 .

In 1835, the Connecticut Legislature granted a rail charter to the "km) railroad line. In 1852, the first railroad line in Danbury opened, with two trains making the 75-minute trip to Norwalk.

The city of Danbury was incorporated April 19, 1889.

In 1902, the American Federation of Labor union called for a nationwide boycott of a non-union hat manufacturer, Dietrich Loewe, in Danbury. The manufacturer sued the union under the Sherman Antitrust Act for unlawfully restraining trade. The Supreme Court held that the union was liable for damages in 1908. This case is also known as the Danbury Hatters' case.

A 60-acre (24 hectares) tract near the Danbury Fairgrounds known as Tucker's Field was purchased by local pilots in 1928, and leased to the town. This became an airport, which is now Danbury Municipal Airport (ICAO airport code: KDXR).

Connecticut's largest lake, Candlewood Lake, was artificially created in 1929 where Wood Creek and the Rocky River meet near the Housatonic River.  The lake is operated as a hydroelectric power facility by the Connecticut Light and Power Company. In June 2006, Connecticut Light and Power company sold the man-made lake for nine million dollars.

In the August 1988 issue of ''Money Magazine'', Danbury topped the magazine's list of the best U.S. cities to live in, mostly due to low crime, good schools, and location.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Danbury, where I-84 enters Connecticut, was a popular place for out-of-staters to purchase Powerball tickets. Those who live west of the Hudson River now usually find Pennsylvania more convenient for Powerball.
