'''Ban Ki-moon''' (born Korean: 반기문, Secretary-General of the United Nations. 

Before becoming Secretary-General, Ban was a career diplomat in South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in the United Nations.  He entered diplomatic service the year he graduated from college, accepting his first post in New Delhi.  In the foreign ministry he established a reputation for modesty and competence.

Ban was the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea from January 2004 to November 2006.  In February 2006 he began to campaign for the office of Secretary-General.  Ban was initially considered to be a long shot for the office.  As foreign minister of Korea, however, he was able to travel to all of the countries that were members of the United Nations Security Council, a manoeuvre that turned him into the campaign's front runner.

On Darfur, where he helped persuade Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir to allow peacekeeping troops to enter Sudan.

==Background==
===Childhood===
Ban, the oldest of six children, was born in Eumseong in a small farming village in North Chungcheong, in 1944, while Korea was forcibly occupied by Japan. When he was three, his family moved to the nearby town of U.S. military troops in Korea were the first Americans whom Ban ever met.<ref name=LAT10-09/>

===Education===
In secondary school Ban became a star pupil, particularly in his studies of English.  According to local stories, Ban would regularly walk  to a fertilizer factory to practice English with the factory's American advisors.<ref name="NYT 12-22"/>  In 1952, he was selected by his class to address a message to then UN Secretary-General Red Cross and earned a trip to the San Francisco with a host family for several months.<ref name=FT10-10/>  As part of the trip, Ban met U.S. President John F. Kennedy.<ref name=Times12-09/>  When asked by a journalist at the meeting what Ban wanted to be when he grew up, he said "I want to become a diplomat."<ref name=LAT10-09/>

Ban received a International Relations from Seoul National University in 1970, and earned a Master of Public Administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1985.<ref name=LAT10-09></ref>  At Harvard, he studied under Joseph Nye who remarked that Ban had "a rare combination of analytic clarity, humility and perseverance."<ref name=FT10-10/>

According to his curriculum vitae, in addition to his native Korean, Ban speaks English, French, German, and Japanese. There have been questions, however, regarding the extent of his knowledge of French, one of the two working languages of the United Nations Secretariat.<ref name=Phoney/>

===Family===
Ban Ki-moon met Yoo Soon-taek in 1962 when they were both high school students. Ban was 18 years old, and Yoo Soon-taek was his secondary school's student council president. Ban Ki-moon married Yoo Soon-taek in 1971.  They have three adult children: two daughters and a son. His eldest daughter, Seon-yong (born 1972), works for the UNICEF in Nairobi, Kenya.<ref name=Times12-09/> After his election as Secretary-General, Ban became an icon in his hometown, where his extended family still resides.  Over 50,000 gathered in a soccer stadium in Chungju for celebration of the result.  In the months after his appointment, thousands of practitioners of Buddhist.<ref name="NYT 12-22"/>

=== Personality ===
Ban's personality has been described by many as sort of bland.  In the Korean Foreign Ministry his nickname was ''Ban-chusa'', meaning "the Bureaucrat" or "the administrative clerk".  The name was used as both positive and negative: complimenting Ban's attention to detail and administrative skill while deriding what was seen as a lack of charisma and subservience to his superiors.<ref name=Economist10-07></ref>  The Korean press corps calls him "the slippery eel" for his ability to dodge questions.<ref name=LAT10-09/>  His demeanor has also been described as a "Confucian approach".<ref name=Time></ref>  

Ban's work ethic is well-documented.  His schedule is reportedly broken into five-minute blocks; Ban claims to sleep for only five hours a night and never to have been late for work.  During the nearly three years he was foreign minister for South Korea the only vacation he took was for his daughter's wedding.<ref name=FT10-10/>  Ban has said that his only hobby is golf, and he plays only a couple of games a year.<ref name=Times12-09/>

At the 2006 UN Correspondents' dinner in early December, after being elected Secretary-General, Ban surprised the audience by singing a version of "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town", with the lyrics "Ban Ki-moon is coming to town" instead.<ref name="WashBolton"></ref>  A major aim of Ban's campaign for UN Secretary-General and a focus of his early days in office was allaying concerns that he was too dull for the job.<ref name=FT02-01/>

==Diplomatic career==
thumb|left|Ban Ki-moon with [[Condoleezza Rice]]
After graduation from university, Ban received the top score on Korea's foreign service exam.  He joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in May 1970, and worked his way up the career ladder during the years of the Yusin Constitution.<ref name=FT10-10/>

His first overseas posting was to New Delhi where he served as vice consul and impressed many of his superiors in the foreign ministry with his competence.  Ban reportedly accepted a posting to India rather than the more prestigious United States, because in India he would be able to save more money, and send more home to his family.<ref name=BBCprofile/><ref name=KH/> In 1974 he received his first posting to the United Nations, as First Secretary of the South Permanent Observer Mission (South Korea only became a full UN member state on September 17, 1991).<ref name=NYT10-03></ref>  After Park Chung-hee's 1979 assassination, Ban assumed the post of Director of the United Nations Division.

In 1980 Ban became director of the United Nation's International Organizations and Treaties Bureau, headquartered in Seoul.<ref name=KH/>  He has been posted twice to the Republic of Korea embassy in Washington, D.C. Between these two assignments he served as Director-General for American Affairs in 1990–1992.  In 1992, he became Vice Chairman of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, following the adoption by South and North Korea of the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.<ref name=BBCprofile/> From 1993–1994 Ban was Korea's deputy ambassador to the United States. He was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and International Organizations in 1995 and then appointed National Security Advisor to the President in 1996.<ref name=KH/> Ban's lengthy career overseas has been credited with helping him avoid South Korea's unforgiving political environment.<ref name=Time/>

Ban was appointed Ambassador to Austria in 1998, and a year later he was also elected as Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO PrepCom). During the negotiations, in what Ban considers the biggest blunder of his career, he included a positive statement about the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in a public letter with Russia in 2001, shortly after the United States had decided to abandon the treaty.  To avoid anger from the United States, Ban was fired by President Kim Dae-jung, who also issued a public apology for Ban's statement.<ref name=Times12-09/>

Ban was unemployed for the first and only time in his career and was expecting to receive an assignment to work in a remote and unimportant embassy.<ref name=Times12-09/>  In 2001, during the 56th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Republic of Korea held the rotating presidency, and to Ban's surprise, he was selected to be the chief of staff to general assembly president Han Seung-soo.<ref name="Times10-14"></ref>  In 2003, the new Korean President Roh Moo-hyun selected Ban as one of his foreign policy advisors.<ref name=KH/>

=== Foreign Minister of Korea ===

In 2004, Ban replaced Islamic extremists; and in December 2004 dozens of Koreans died in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Ban survived scrutiny from lawmakers and saw an upturn in his popularity when talks began with North Korea.<ref name=KH></ref> Ban became actively involved in issues relating to inter-Korean relationships.<ref name=BBCprofile></ref> In September 2005, as Foreign Minister, he played a leading role in the diplomatic efforts to adopt the Joint Statement on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue at the Fourth Round of the Six-party talks held in Beijing.<ref name="Official Bio"/><ref name="Newsweek"></ref>

As foreign minister, Ban oversaw the trade and aid policies of South Korea. This work put Ban in the position of signing trade deals and delivering foreign assistance to diplomats who would later be influential in his candidacy for Secretary-General. For example, Ban became the first senior South Korean minister to travel to the Congo, since its independence in 1960.<ref name=WashPost0929></ref>

===Awards===
Ban has been awarded the Order of Service Merit by the Government of the Republic of Korea on three occasions: in 1975, 1986 and 2006.<ref name="Official Bio"></ref>  For his accomplishments as an envoy, he received the Grand Decoration of Honour from the Republic of Austria in 2001. He has received awards from many of the countries with which he has worked diplomatically: the government of Brazil bestowed the Grand Cross of Rio Branco upon him, the government of Peru awarded him Gran Cruz del Sol Sun, and the Korea Society in New York City honored him with the James A. Van Fleet Award for his contributions to friendship between the United States and the Republic of Korea.<ref></ref>

In February 2006, Ban declared his candidacy to replace Kofi Annan as UN Secretary-General at the end of 2006, becoming the first South Korean to run for the office.<ref></ref> Though Ban was the first to announce a candidacy, he was not originally considered a serious contender.<ref name=FT10-10></ref>

Over the next eight months, Ban made ministerial visits to each of the 15 countries with a seat on the Security Council.<ref name=LAT10-09/>  Of the seven candidates, he topped each of the four straw polls conducted by the United Nations Security Council: on July 24,<ref></ref> September 14,<ref></ref> September 28,<ref></ref> and October 2.<ref></ref> 

During the period in which these polls took place, Ban made major speeches to the Asia Society and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  To be confirmed, Ban needed not only to win the support of the diplomatic community, but be able to avoid a veto from any of the five permanent members of the council: People's Republic of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Ban was popular in Washington for having pushed to send South Korean troops to Iraq.  But Ban also opposed several U.S. positions: he expressed his support for the International Criminal Court and favored an entirely non-confrontational approach to dealing with North Korea.<ref name=LAT10-09/> Ban said during his campaign that he would like to visit North Korea in person to meet with Kim Jong-il directly.<ref name="Newsweek"/> Ban was viewed as a stark contrast from Kofi Annan, who was considered charismatic, but perceived as a weak manager because of problems surrounding the UN's oil-for-food program in Iraq.<ref name=Economist10-07/>

Ban also struggled to win the approval of France. His official biography states that he speaks both English and French, the two working languages of the UN Secretariat. He has repeatedly struggled to answer questions in French from journalists.<ref name=Phoney></ref> Ban has repeatedly acknowledged his limitations at French, but assured French diplomats that he was devoted to continuing his study. At a press conference on January 11, 2007, Ban remarked, “my French perhaps could be improved, and I am continuing to work. I have taken French lessons over the last few months. I think that, even if my French isn't perfect, I will continue to study it.”<ref></ref>

As the Secretary-General election drew closer there was rising criticism of the South Korean campaign on Ban's behalf. Specifically, his alleged practice of systematically visiting all member states of the Security Council in his role as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to secure votes in his support by signing trade deals with European countries and pledging developing countries were the focus of many news articles.<ref></ref>  According to ''The Washington Post'', "rivals have privately grumbled that Republic of Korea, which has the world's 11th-largest economy, has wielded its economic might to generate support for his candidacy". Ban reportedly has said that these insinuations are "groundless". In an interview on 17 September, 2006 he stated: "As front-runner, I know that I can become a target of this very scrutinizing process," and "I am a man of integrity."<ref></ref>

In the final informal poll on October 2, Ban received fourteen favorable votes and one abstention ("no opinion") from the fifteen members of the Security Council (the polls were secret, but the US Representative to the UN John R. Bolton later remarked that it was Japan who abstained). More importantly, Ban was the only one to escape a veto; each of the other candidates received at least one "no" vote from among the five permanent members.<ref></ref> After the vote, Shashi Tharoor, who finished second, withdrew his candidacy<ref></ref> and China's Permanent Representative to the UN told reporters that "it is quite clear from today's straw poll that Minister Ban Ki-moon is the candidate that the Security Council will recommend to the General Assembly."<ref></ref>

On General Assembly acclaimed Ban as Secretary-General.<ref name="Times10-14"/>

==Term as Secretary-General==

When Ban became Secretary-General, ''The Economist'' listed the major challenges facing him in 2007: "rising nuclear demons in Iran and North Korea, a haemorrhaging wound in Darfur, unending violence in the Middle East, looming environmental disaster, escalating international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the spread of HIV/AIDS.  And then the more parochial concerns, such as the largely unfinished business of the most sweeping attempt at reform in the UN's history."<ref name=Econ01-06/>  Before starting, Kofi Annan shared the story that when the first Secretary-General Trygve Lie left office he told his successor, Dag Hammarskjöld, "You are about to take over the most impossible job on earth."<ref name="Times10-14"/>

On Shia Muslims in the Iraqi village of Dujail in the 1980s. In a statement through his spokesperson on 6 January, he “strongly urged the Government of Iraq to grant a stay of execution to those whose death sentences may be carried out in the near future.” <ref></ref><ref name=FT02-01/> On the broader issue, he told a Washington, D.C. audience on January 16, 2007 that he recognized and encouraged the “growing trend in international society, international law and domestic policies and practices to phase out eventually the death penalty.”<ref></ref>

On the tenth anniversary of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appealed April 15 2008 for the senior leaders of the regime to be brought to justice. The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia-tribunal, which was established by both the United Nations and Cambodia, which became operational in 2006, is expected to continue until at least 2010.<ref></ref>

===Cabinet===
In early January, Ban appointed the key members of his cabinet.  As his Deputy Secretary-General he selected Tanzanian foreign minister and professor Asha-Rose Migiro, a move that pleased African diplomats who had concerns of losing power without Annan in office.<ref></ref>
