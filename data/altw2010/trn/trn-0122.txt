The '''University of Reading''' is a English town of Reading, Berkshire.

Established in 1892, receiving its Royal Charter in 1926, the University has a long tradition of research, education and training at a local, national and international level. It was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education in 1998, and again in 2005. It is one of the ten most research-intensive universities in the UK, as well as being considered one of the top 200 universities in the world. It is also one of the highest financially endowed Universities in the UK, at 9th position in the most recent table.<ref></ref>

==History==
The University owes its origins to the Schools of Art and Science established in Reading in 1860 and 1870. These became part of an extension college of Christ Church College of the University of Oxford in 1892, which became known as University College, Reading.

The new college received its first treasury grant in 1901. Three years later it was given a site, in London Road,  by the Palmer family of Huntley & Palmers fame. The same family's continued support enabled the opening of Wantage Hall in 1908 and the Research Institute in Dairying in 1912.

The college first applied for a Royal Charter in 1920 but was unsuccessful at that time. However a second petition, in 1925, was successful, and the charter was officially granted on March 17 1926. With the charter, the University College became the University of Reading, the only new university to be created in England between the two world wars. 

In 1947 the University purchased Red Brick, campus.<ref></ref> In 1982 the University merged with Bulmershe College of Higher Education, in the process acquiring its third campus.<ref name="bulletin0603">University of Reading (2006). Bulletin newsletter dated March 16 2006.</ref>

In 1984 the University started a merger with Bulmershe College of Higher Education, which was completed in 1989.<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1989/Uksi_19890408_en_1.htm Statutory Instrument 1989 no. 408]</ref>

In October 2006, the Senior Management Board proposed<ref>[http://www.extra.rdg.ac.uk/news/details.asp?ID=712 Official statement about the Physics Department on the University website]</ref> the closure of its Physics Department to future undergraduate application. This was ascribed to financial reasons and lack of alternative ideas and caused considerable controversy, not least a debate in Parliament<ref>[http://www.martinsalter.com/diary.asp?storyID=235&storyType=parliament Information page of Labour MP for Reading West, Martin Salter]</ref> over the closure which prompted heated discussion of higher education issues in general.<ref>[http://www.extra.rdg.ac.uk/news/details.asp?ID=719 Official Statement about University Senate vote from University website]</ref>. On October 10th the Senate voted to close the Department of Physics, a move confirmed by the Council on November 20th.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6159106.stm BBC News article concerning the confirmed closure of the Physics department]</ref>  Other departments closed in recent years include Music, Sociology, Geology, and Mechanical Engineering. 

In January 2008, the University announced its merger with Henley Management College to create the new Henley Business School at the University of Reading, bringing together Henley's expertise in MBAs with the University's existing Business School and ICMA Centre.<ref name=henmerge></ref>

==Campuses==

The University maintains over  of grounds, in three distinct campuses:

*Whiteknights Campus, at , is the largest and includes Whiteknights Lake, conservation meadows and woodlands as well as most of the University's departments. The campus takes its name from the nickname of the 13th century Marquis of Blandford. The main University library, in the middle of the campus, holds nearly a million books and subscribes to around 4,000 periodicals.

*The smaller London Road Campus is the original University site and is closer to the town centre of Reading. The London Road site forms the base for the majority of the university's extra-mural and distance learning activities, and is host to the Centre for Continuing Education and the Professional Management Programmes. Moreover, it plays host to the University graduation ceremonies twice a year, in the Great Hall.

*The Bulmershe Court Campus in Woodley is the second biggest campus belonging to the University. Formerly Bulmershe Teaching College, in 1989 the College of Higher Education merged with The University of Reading and the campus is now the home of The Institute of Education and the Department of Film, Theatre and Television, alongside the Bulmershe site of Students’ Union, Breeze Bar, and Bulmershe Hall of Residences. It also has the largest hall of residence of the University. Furthermore, the campus hosts a range of the University's home sporting fixtures, including football, basketball and the Reading Knights American Football team.

The University also owns  of farmland in the nearby villages of Arborfield, Sonning and Shinfield. These support a mixed farming system including dairy cows, ewes and beef animals, and host research centres of which the flagship is the Centre for Dairy Research.

As part of the proposed Whiteknights Development Plan in Autumn 2007, the University proposed spending up to £250 million on its estates over 30 years, principally to focus academic activities onto the Whiteknights site.<ref></ref> The University also intends to site some functions on the London Road site, with a complete withdrawal from Bulmershe Court proposed by 2012.

==Research and Business Development==
The university had a research income of almost £24.5 million in 2003-4, of which around 10 percent of annual research income derived from industrial or commercial sponsors. Over £2 million of funding has been secured in 2004 for business development and the commercial activities at the University.

In the Research Assessment Exercise in 2001, five departments were awarded the top rate of 5* – English, Italian, Centre for Advanced Microscopy.

Reading was the first university to win a Queen's Award for Export Achievement in 1989. Since then several initiatives to link the academic and commercial communities have followed. SEEDA sponsored business incubators, opened on campus in 2003.

=== ACET Centre ===
The major aim of the Centre for Advanced Computing and Emerging Technologies (ACET) is to demonstrate and promote new ways of doing multidisciplinary research based on the approach of "scientific discovery through advanced computing".

==Community==
In the 2004–05 academic year, the university had 4,024 staff and 15,326 students. The best known member of the university community is probably the cyberneticist Professor Kevin Warwick.

Spark, a bi-weekly newspaper aimed at the student population of the University, which was weekly until October 2006 (it is now published fortnightly during term-time) and runs the student radio station [http://www.1287am.com/ Junction11]. The university also has a number of Junior Common Rooms that are nominally independent from the Students' Union and the University.

The Students' Union building on Whiteknights Campus contains an 1800 capacity venue called 3sixty, two bars, a number of retail outlets, and The Hub. The Hub is the Union's new volunteer, advice, student activity centre, cost around £1.8m and was officially opened in March 2007 by the Hon. Bill Rammell MP, Minister for Higher Education.

==University Halls and accommodation==
Student accommodation is provided in a number of halls of residence offering a good mix of partially catered (under review) and self-catering accommodation, along with other self-catering accommodation. Most of the halls of residence lie close to the northern campus periphery and in residential areas close by.

Bridges, Childs, Wessex, Whiteknights, and Windsor Halls are on the Whiteknights Campus. St. George’s, St. Patrick’s, Sherfield, Sibly, Wantage, and Wells Halls are in the residential areas surrounding Whiteknights, as is the self-catering accommodation of the Reading Student Village, Hillside Court and Martindale Court.<ref name=hallbook></ref>

St. David's and Mansfield Halls latterly formed part of Witan Hall (see below) on the London Road Campus, and are not currently in use. The former St. Andrews Hall closed in 2001, and is now the home of the Museum of English Rural Life.

St. George's Hall and The Reading Student Village are leased back to the University from UJC. The cost of leasing back the Student Village to the University, according to the University accounts, was £1.5 million for 2003–04 and £1.3 million in 2002–03.
