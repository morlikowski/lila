'''Deming''' is a city in Luna County, Las Cruces. The population was 14,116 at the 2000 census. Deming is the county seat and principal town of Luna County.

==History==
The city, founded in 1881 and incorporated in 1902, was an important port of entry on the US-Mexican border until the Gadsden Purchase of 1853. A nick name was given to the city at the time of its founding, "New Chicago". It was expected that with the surge of Railroad usage, that the city would grow drastically and resemble Chicago, Illinois. This nick name was, however, short lived.

Deming is named after Mary Ann Deming Crocker, wife of Southern Pacific with the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroads. This was the second complete transcontinental railroad in the United States.

There are numerous prehistoric Native American sites around Deming.  The Mimbres and Casas Grandes cultures made pottery of remarkable quality, and the Deming area is (or was) rich in native pottery artifacts...as well as beads, stone implements, stone carvings, graves, etc. Laws against these practices were passed, but the damage had been done.

==Geography==
Deming is centered at  (32.261137, -107.755857), in the Basin and Range Province.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 9.3&nbsp;square miles (24.2&nbsp;km²), all of it land.  The city is surrounded by land that  appears flat, with wide rubble aprons around the nearby mountains and imperceptible grades in various directions.

The Mimbres River floods the Deming area once a decade or so, in periods of unusually heavy rainfall in the Cooke's Range and Black Range to the north.  

Deming and its surrounding area is underlain by an aquifer of good-quality water.  The aquifer is slowly recharged primarily by water from the mountains to the north.  The water usually has a high sulfur content.

In the late 1960's, Select Western Lands Inc. ran full-page ads for land in Deming in The Saturday Evening Post.  The ads proclaimed "Your Own Ranchette Only $299, Only $5 a Month", for a half-acre.  Up to two acres were offered, those for "$1196.  Only $15 a month."

==Climate==

Deming is located within the Upper Chihuahuan Desert climate zone.  The climate is dry, hot, and breezy.  Winters are mild, with occasional snow that usually melts within a day or two.  Summer temperatures often exceed 100°F (37.8°C), but the altitude (4000 ft / 1219 m) and dry air make summer days more comfortable than one would expect given the high temperature. <ref>[http://www.cityofdeming.org/climate.html Deming, New Mexico<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Most precipitation occurs as thunderstorms and showers during the July-September 'monsoon' period.  Minor flooding sometimes occurs over large areas of flat ground.  There are periods lasting from 5 to 20 years of relatively wet or dry years.  Springtime is often windy, and during dry years dust storms can be severe--sometimes lasting for days.  Snow is likely to fall in winter, but usually melts in a day or two.  Temperatures in winter are sometimes below freezing at night, but winter days are generally mild and sunny.

==Flora and fauna==

There are numerous species of wildflowers and weedy plants that grow naturally depending on rainfall, but the natural landscape is dominated by creosote bush, honey mesquite, and soaptree yucca.  Numerous species of cactus are common on and around the many small mountain ranges.

roadrunners are abundant.  Rattlesnakes, bullsnakes, and several other snake species are to be found.  Deer, bear, sheep, and even parrots can be found in some of the nearby mountains.
