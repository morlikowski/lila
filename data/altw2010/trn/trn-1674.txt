'''Benjamin Creme''' er en britisk kunstner og forfatter som siden 1974 har forutsagt, blant annet gjennom helsides annonser i store aviser i mange land, at Maitreya, den nye verdenslæreren snart skal stå fram. 

Benjamin Creme ser Maitreya som oppfyllelslen av alle religioners forventninger. Han er Kristus, den femte Buddha, den skjulte Mahdi, en ny inkarnasjon av Krishna osv. Ifølge Creme er «alle disse ulike navn for samme vesen».

Det å sidestille Kristus med andre religioners sentrale skikkelser er et velkjent tema i New Age bevegelsens forløper teosofien. Teosofien bygger på skriftene til H. P. Blavatsky, som  ble utviklet videre av Alice  A. Bailey. Det var hun som framfor noen lanserte begrepet «den nye tid» - New Age eller vannmannens tidsalder.   

Benjamin Cremes «Kristus» og hans gjenkomst har støtt på problemer. I likhet med Jehovas Vitner sine profetier om verdens undergang, ble Maitreyas «Åpenbaringsdag» en ikke-begivenhet i 1982. Skuffelsen, som tydelig kom frem i Cremes nyhetsbrev samme år, har siden blitt erstattet av  rasjonalisering.

Den 21.-22. april 1990 i London hevdet Creme at Maitreya organiserte et toppmøte med journalister, religiøse og politiske ledere fra hele verden. Her skal Maitreya ha kommet til syne og forsvunnet igjen etter å ha talt om sitt arbeid og sin lære. Creme sier at denne begivenheten ble referert i et amerikansk sensasjonsblad som skal ha sitert en biskop fra Vatikanet si: «Det er overveldende bevis på at Kristi tilbakevendelse allerede har funnet sted». Enda engang er «Åpenbaringsdagen» en nært forestående begivenhet, hvor forberedelsene til «Verdenslærerens» tilsynekomst for oss beskrives som «fullbrakte».

==Biography and ministry==
He was a member of the UFO based new religious movement) between 1957 and 1959, when he left due to disagreements.<ref>Barrett, David V. ''The New Believers'' 2001 ISBN 0-304-35592-5, page 347-349</ref> 

He first began to speak publicly of his mission on May 30th, 1975, at the Friends Meeting House on Euston Road in London, England.

From 1975 to 1979, Creme lectured, by invitation, throughout Europe. During his first US tour in 1980, he spoke to large audiences in many major cities. For that trip, he was sponsored by Leland Stewart's organization, the Unity and Diversity Council.  Since the early 1980s, his tours have included Western and Eastern Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, and two trips a year through the US. He has been interviewed on more than 300 radio and television programs in the US.  On some of those radio shows, he generated controversy by alleged positive remarks about Lucifer. Creme has stated that "Lucifer is the name of a great Angel, not an upstart in heaven who revolted against God and was put down into the nether regions as the Devil. That is a complete misinterpretation. Lucifer means light, and comes from the Latin lux, lucis, meaning light. It is the name of the Angel Who ensouls the human kingdom..."<ref>[http://www.share-international.org/archives/AgelessWisdom/faq_basic.htm  Share International website:Ageless Wisdom teachings and spirituality Basic tenets FAQ]</ref>

Some Christian Evangelical sources have accused Creme and his version of Maitreya of being a satanical conspiracy.<ref>David V. Barrett ''The New Believers'' 2001 ISBN 0-304-35592-5, page 349</ref>

==The Return of the Christ to Inaugurate the Age of Aquarius==

In 1982 Creme placed advertisements in newspapers around the world saying, "The Christ is now here". According to Creme the "Christ", whom he also called "Maitreya", would announce his existence on world wide television broadcasts, and that he would do that within several months of the initial newspaper advertisement. This created a sensation within some New Age groups, and even among some Evangelical Christians; but, when the promised television broadcasts of the Maitreya/Christ failed to occur, most of Creme's followers lost interest. Creme, who is independently wealthy, continues to fund newspaper advertisements and press conferences, as well as to fund his journal and websites <ref>[http://www.skepticfiles.org/ignor/naconspr.htm THE NEW AGE CONSPIRACY]</ref>. 

Creme states (responding to a question) that when the "Day of Declaration: occurs, "The Christ will come on the world's television channels, linked together by satellite. All those with access to television will see... [His face]. He will establish a telepathic rapport with all humanity simultaneously". <ref> ''Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission I'' 1986 Page 23 </ref>  While the Christ is speaking... [everyone will feel far more love than they've ever felt before, that massive outpouring of love will cause] "hundreds of thousands of 'miracle' cures will take place simultaneously."  That is how everyone will know it is really the Christ that has returned. 

According to Creme, it is for those who believe in the Emergence to share their belief with others, to whatever degree they believe it to be possible. <ref> Niebuhr, Gustav. "New Millennium, Great Expectations." The New York Times, Saturday, July 20, 1996, p. 9 </ref>
