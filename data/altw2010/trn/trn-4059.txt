'''Jazydyzm''', '''jezydyzm''', (kurd. ''Êzidîtî'' lub ''Êzidî'') – synkretyczna założona w Kurdów mieszkających na pograniczu Iraku (okolice Iranu, Turcji, Syrii, Armenii oraz na emigracji (gł. szyizmu na chrześcijaństwa, pierwotnych wierzeń indoirańskich i kurdyjskich oraz judaistycznych.

Jazydzi wierzą, że anioł szahady do ucha niemowlętom. Są zwolennikami reinkarnacji, czczą Jezusa i alawici, niechętnie mówią o swoich wierzeniach i wciąż wiemy o nich niewiele. Obecnie na świecie żyje ponad 150 tys. wyznawców, a według własnych danych ponad milion - rozbieżność może wynikać ze stosowania przez wiernych szyickiej zasady takijji, która pozwala ukrywać wiarę w czasie prześladowań. Jazydzi zwykle uważają się za odrębny od Kurdów naród.

Wrogowie jazydyzmu uważają czczonego przez jazydów Malak-Tausa za diabła, ponieważ pod względem etymologicznym imię ''Malak-Taus'' jest podobne do arabskiego słowa ''Szaitan'' oznaczającego diabła. Religioznawcy i jazydyści twierdzą jednak, że kult Malak-Tausa nie posiada cech kultu diabła (diabła rozumianego na sposób judeo-chrześcijańsko-islamski).

W byłych republikach radzieckich (np. w Gruzji czy w Armenii) jazydyzm funkcjonuje w oderwaniu od aspektu religijnego i pełni funkcje wyróżnika mniejszości narodowej. W takim przypadku jazydami są osoby, które są równocześnie muzułmanami czy chrześcijanami obrządku wschodniego. Tamże, Jazydowie posługują się językami wywodzącymi się z dialektów północno-kurdyjskich.

15 sierpnia 2007 r. w irackim mieście Kahtanija zamieszkałym przez wyznawców jazydyzmu miały miejsce 3 samobójcze ataki terrorystyczne: zginęło ponad 400 mieszkańców, ponad 500 zostało rannych, a 30 domów zostało całkowicie zniszczonych.

== Społeczność jazydzka == 

Społeczeństwo jazydzkie dzieli się na 3 kasty:
* Szejków 
* Pirsów
* Mridów

The '''Yazidi''' (also '''Yezidi''', Kurdish: ''Êzidî'', Assyrian/Syriac: ܓ̰ܠܟܝܐ) is an Iranian religion with ancient Indo-European roots. Yazidis are primarily Kurdish speaking, and most live in the Mosul region of northern Iraq. There are traditional communities in Transcaucasia, Turkey, and Syria, but these have declined since the 1990s, their members emigrating to Europe, especially to Germany.<ref></ref> 

The term ''Dasni'' or ''Dasny'' is misunderstood. A large Yezidi-clan/tribe is called Dasni. There are many Yazidis who belong to the tribe, and the two terms are sometimes seen as interchangeable. The Yazidis do not use it for self-designation.

==Demographics==
thumb|left|Yazidi men in [[2007]]
Yazidis make up an important Georgian community has declined significantly (decreasing from 30,000 during the 1990s to an estimated 14,000 in 2008), while  communities in Armenia have been more stable (some 40,000 according to 2001 census). In Russia, the Yazidi population totals 31,273 (2002 census). In Syria, there are  two main groupings, in the Jazira and the Kurd Daege, accounting for about 15,000 people. In Turkey, there are now just a very small remnant in some villages south-east of Diyarbakir, remnants of a community of some 80,000 in 1970 (declined to 23,000 in 1985 and to 377 people in 2007). 

The Yazidi number around 200,000 to 300,000 individuals in total, but estimates vary on their population size, partially due to the Yazidi tradition of secrecy when asked about one's religious beliefs. Lower estimates are around 100,000, and high estimates around 700,000. Expatriate Yazidi are concentrated in Germany, numbering between 20,000 and 40,000, mainly in  Niedersachsen and Nordrhein-Westfalen, most of them from Turkey. A much smaller diaspora community is found in the Netherlands. Very small groups are also found in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the US, Canada and Australia, probably totalling to below 5,000 people.

==Origins==
thumb|Yazidi men in [[Mardin, late 19th century]]
The origins of Yazidism are ultimately shrouded in Middle Eastern prehistory. Although the Yazidis speak Kurdish, their religion shows strong influence from archaic Mosul. The Yazidis' own name for themselves is ''Êzidî'' or ''Êzîdî'' or, in some areas, ''Dasinî'' (the latter, strictly speaking, is a tribal name). Some scholars have derived the name Yazidi from Old Iranic ''Kurdish, and almost all speak Kurmanjî (Northern Kurdish), with the exception of the villages of Bashiqa and Bahazane in Northern Iraq, where Arabic is spoken. Kurmanjî is the language of almost all the orally transmitted religious traditions of the Yazidis. Thus, religious origins are somewhat complex.

The religion of the  Yazidis is a highly pagan religions; however, publications since the 1990s have shown such an approach to be overly simplistic.<ref name="iranica"/>

The origin of the Yazidi religion is now usually seen by scholars as a complex process of syncretism, whereby the belief system and practices of a local faith had a profound influence on the religiosity of adherents of the ˤAdawiyya Sufi order living in the Kurdish mountains, and caused it to deviate from Islamic norms relatively soon after the death of its founder, ˤAdī ibn Musafir (Kurdish ''Şêx Adî''), who is said to be of Laliş (some thirty-six miles north-east of Mosul) in the early 12<sup>th</sup> century CE. Şêx Adî himself, a figure of undoubted orthodoxy, enjoyed widespread influence. He died in 1162, and his tomb at Laliş is a focal point of Yazidi pilgrimage.

During the fourteenth century, important Kurdish tribes whose sphere of influence stretched well into what is now Turkey (including, for a period, the rulers of the principality of Jazira) are cited in historical sources as Yazidi.

==Yazidi and Indo-European gods==
The word ''Tawûs'' (in ''Tawûsê Melek'') is derived from the Indo-European root ''diyus'' "sky" and is a Greek Zeus. Indo-Iranians used to worship the souls of their fathers and grandfathers and glorified the souls of their dead. They believed in ''Diwyuh Pitar'' "Father Sky" and other divine beings, the ''daiwa''s and ''asura''s. The prophet Zoroaster taught that there was only one God, who he called ''Ahura Mazda'' "the ''asura'' Wisdom", and abolished reverence and worship of the ''daiwa''s as evil. However, many groups kept their old beliefs and continued to revere the ''daiwa''s.

According to scholar Taufiq Wahby and others, the word ''Dasni'', the ethnic self-designation of Yazidis, is a form of the old word ''devayasne'' "''daiwa''-worshipping", used by Zoroastrians to identify those who do not follow the prophet's teachings.<ref>[http://www.institutkurde.org/en/conferences/kurdish_studies_irbil_2006/Khalil+Jindy+RASHOW.html Keys to a wider understanding of the Yezidi Religion], K. J. Rashow (Georg-August-Universität), World Congress of Kurdish Studies, September 2006, Irbil.</ref>

==Religious beliefs==
thumb|right|[[Melek Taus, the peacock angel]]
In the Yazidi belief system, the world was created by a god, and the world is now in the care of a ''Heptad'' of seven Kurdish), the Peacock Angel. According to the ''Encyclopedia of the Orient'', "The reason for the Yazidis reputation of being devil worshipers, is connected to the other name of Melek Taus, Koran has for Satan".<ref name="looklex"></ref> Furthermore, the Yazidi story regarding Malek Taus' rise to favor with God is almost identical to the story of the jinn Iblis in Islam, except that Yazidis revere Malek Taus for refusing to submit to Adam, while Muslims believe that Iblis' refusal to submit caused him to fall out of Grace with God, and to later become Satan himself.<ref name="brittanica">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69144/Islam Islam: Satan, sin, and repentance] at Encyclopædia Britannica</ref>

Yazidis believe that Melek Taus is not a source of evil or wickedness. They consider him to be the leader of the Adam to question him. Sheikh Adî believed that the spirit of Melek Taus is the same as his own, perhaps as a reincarnation. He is believed to have said: "I was present when Adam was living in Paradise, and also when Nemrud threw Abraham in fire. I was present when God said to me: 'You are the ruler and Lord on the Earth'. God, the compassionate, gave me seven earths and throne of the heaven."

Yazidi accounts of creation differ from that of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. They believe that God first created Melek Taus from his own illumination (''Ronahî '' in Kurdish) and the other six archangels were created later. God ordered Melek Taus not to bow to other beings. Then God created the other archangels and ordered them to bring him dust (''Ax'') from the Earth (''Erd'') and build the body of Adam. Then God gave life to Adam from his own breath and instructed all archangels to bow to Adam. The archangels obeyed except for Melek Taus. In answer to God, Malek Taus replied, "How can I submit to another being! I am from your illumination while Adam is made of dust." Then God praised him and made him the leader of all angels and his deputy on the Earth. (This likely furthers what some see as a connection to the Islamic ''Shaytan,'' as according to legend he too refused to bow to Adam at God's command, though in this case it is seen as being a sign of Shaytan's sinful pride.) Hence the Yazidis believe that Melek Taus is the representative of God on the face of the Earth, and comes down to the Earth on the first Wednesday of Nisan (April). Yazidis hold that God created Malek Taus on this day, and celebrate it as New Year's day. Yazidis argue that the order to bow to Adam was only a test for Melek Taus, since if God commands anything then it must happen. (''Bibe, dibe''). In other words, God could have made him submit to Adam, but gave Taus the choice as a test. They believe that their respect and praise for Melek Taus is a way to acknowledge his majestic and sublime nature. This idea is called "Knowledge of the Sublime" (''Zanista Ciwaniyê''). Sheikh Adî has observed the story of Melek Taus and believed in him.<ref name="yeziditruth_sheik">

One of the key creation beliefs of Yazidism is that all Yazidis are descendants of Adam rather than Eve.<ref name="looklex"/> Yazidis believe that good and evil both exist in the mind and spirit of human beings. It depends on the humans, themselves, as to which they choose. In this process, their devotion to Melek Taus is essential, since it was he who was given the same choice between good and evil by God, and chose the good.

Yazidis, who have much in common with the followers of magic number such as forty or forty thousand years) before being remade in its current state. During this period the ''Heptad'' were called into existence, God made a covenant with them and entrusted the world to them. Besides Melek Taus, members of the Heptad (the Seven), who were called into existence by God at the beginning of all things, include Sheikh Adî, his companion ''Shaikh Hasan'', and a group known as the ''four Mysteries'', Shamsadin, Fakhradin, Sajadin and Naserdin. The Yazidi Book of Revelation) and the ''Mishefa Reş'' (Black Book).

Two key and interrelated features of Yazidism are: a) a preoccupation with religious purity and b) a belief in metempsychosis. The first of these is expressed in the system of caste, the food laws, the traditional preferences for living in Yazidi communities, and the variety of taboos governing many aspects of life. The second is crucial; Yazidis traditionally believe that the Seven Holy Beings are periodically reincarnated in human form, called a ''koasasa''.

A belief in the reincarnation of lesser Yazidi souls also exists. Like the Ahl-e Haqq, the Yazidis use the metaphor of a change of garment to describe the process, which they call ''kiras guhorîn'' in Kurdish (changing the garment). Alongside this, Yazidi mythology also includes descriptions of heaven and hell, with hell extinguished, and other traditions incorporating these ideas into a belief system that includes reincarnation.<ref name="looklex"/>

==Organization==
Yazidi society is hierarchical. The secular leader is a hereditary endogamous. In addition, members of the three Yazidi pirs, marry only within their group.

==Religious practices==
===Prayers===
left|thumb|Yazidi ritual, [[2007]]
Yazidis have five daily prayers:<ref name="yeziditruth_religious"></ref>       

The worshipers should turn their face toward the sun, and for the noon prayer, they should face toward Laliş. Such prayer should be accompanied by certain gestures, including kissing the rounded neck (''gerîvan'') of the sacred shirt (''kiras''). The daily prayer services must not be performed in the presence of outsiders, and are always performed in the direction of the sun. Wednesday is the holy day but Saturday is the day of rest.<ref name="yeziditruth_religious"/><ref></ref>  There is also a three-day fast in December.<ref name="looklex"/><ref name="yeziditruth_religious"/>

===Festivals===
The Yazidi New Year falls in Spring (somewhat later than Equinox). There is some lamentation by women in the cemeteries, to the accompaniment of the music of the ''Qewals'', but the festival is generally characterized by joyous events: the music of ''dehol'' (drum) and ''zorna'' (shawm), communal dancing and meals, the decorating of eggs. 

Similarly, the village Tawaf, a festival held in the spring in honor of the patron of the local shrine, has secular music, dance and meals in addition to the performance of sacred music. 

Another important festival is the ''Tawusgeran'' (circulation of the peacock) where Qewals and other religious dignitaries visit Yazidi villages, bringing the senjaq, sacred images representing the peacock and associated with Malek Ta’us. These are venerated, taxes are collected from the pious, sermons are preached, and holy water distributed. 

The greatest festival of the year for ordinary Yazidis is the ''Cejna Cemaiya'' (Feast of the Assembly) at Lalish, a seven-day occasion. A focus of widespread pilgrimage, this is an important time for social contact and affirmation of identity. The religious center of the event is the belief in an annual gathering of the ''Heptad'' in the holy place at this time. Rituals practiced include the sacrifice of a bull at the shrine of Shaikh Shams and the practice of ''sema''.

===Pilgrimage===
thumbnail|right|Tomb of Şêx Adî in Lalish
The most important ritual is the annual seven-day pilgrimage to the tomb of Şêx Adî in Lalish, north of Mosul, Iraq.<ref name="yeziditruth_religious"/><ref></ref> A sacred microcosm of the world, as it were, it contains not only many shrines dedicated to the ''koasasa'', but a number of other landmarks corresponding to other sites or symbols of significance in other faiths, including ''Pirra selat'' "Serat Bridge" and a mountain called Mt. Arafat. The two sacred springs are called Zamzam and ''Kaniya sipî'' "The White Spring".

If possible, Yazidis make at least one pilgrimage to Lalish during their lifetime, and those living in the region try to attend at least once a year for the autumn ''Feast of the Assembly'' which is celebrated from 23 Aylūl (September) to 1 Tashrīn (October). During the celebration, Yazidi bathe in the river, wash figures of Tawûsê Melek and light hundreds of lamps in the tombs of Sheikh Adî and other saints. They also sacrifice an Tashrīn.

===Purity and taboos===
The Yazidis' concern with religious purity, and their reluctance to mix elements perceived to be incompatible, is shown not only in their caste system, but also in various taboos affecting everyday life. Some of these, such as those on exogamy or on insulting or offending men of religion, are widely respected. Others are often ignored when men of religion are not present. Others still are less widely known and may be localized.
