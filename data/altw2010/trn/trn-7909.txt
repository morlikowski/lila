== ストーリー ==

2022年、留まるところを知らない人口増加により、世界は食住を失った人間が路上に溢れ、一部の特権階級と多くの貧民という格差の激しい社会となっていた。肉や野菜といった本物の食料品は宝石以上に稀少で高価なものとなり、特権階級を除くほとんどの人間は、ソイレント社が海のプランクトンから作る合成食品の配給を受けて、細々と生き延びていた。そしてある夜ソイレント社の幹部（ジョゼフ・コットン）が殺害される。ニューヨークに住む殺人課のソーン刑事（チャールトン・ヘストン）は、同居人の老人・ソル（エドワード・G・ロビンソン）の協力を得て捜査に乗り出すが、様々な妨害を受けた後、新製品ソイレント・グリーンの配給中断による暴動のどさくさに紛れて暗殺されそうになる。

そんな中、自室に戻ったソーンは、ソルが「ホーム」に行ったことを伝えられる。慌ててホーム＝公営安楽死施設に向かったソーンは、真実を知ってしまったが故に死を選ぶしかなかったソルの最後を見届けることになる。草原や大海原などの映像とベートーベンの「田園」に包まれてソルが死んだ後、ソーンはその死体を追跡する。そしてソルの死体がトラックでソイレント社の工場に運び込まれ、人間の死体からソイレント・グリーンが生産されている事実を突き止める。その後、暗殺者の襲撃を受け、彼らを倒したものの自身も深手を負ったソーンは、病院に搬送されながら叫ぶ。

'''''Soylent Green''''' is a 1973 dystopian science fiction movie depicting a future in which the greenhouse gas effect results in severe damage to the environment.  This leads to widespread unemployment and poverty. Real fruit, vegetables, and meat are rare, commodities are expensive, and much of the population survives on processed food rations, including "soylent green" wafers.  

The film overlays the genres of science fiction and the New York City police detective Robert Thorn (Charlton Heston) and elderly police researcher Sol Roth (Edward G. Robinson) to investigate the brutal murder of a wealthy businessman named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotten). Thorn and Roth uncover clues which suggest that it is more than simply a bungled burglary. 

The film, which is loosely based upon the 1966 science fiction novel ''Make Room! Make Room!'', by Harry Harrison, won the Nebula Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film in 1973.

==Plot==
Set in the year population has grown to forty million in New York City alone. Most housing is dilapidated and overcrowded, and the impoverished homeless fill the streets and line the fire escapes and stairways of buildings. 
thumb|left|240px|Processed "Soylent Green" ration wafers
Food as we know it today–including fruit, vegetables, and meat–is a rare and expensive commodity. Half of the world's population survives on processed rations produced by the massive Soylent Corporation (from ''lent(il)''), including Soylent Red and Soylent Yellow, which are advertised as "high-energy vegetable concentrates". The newest product is Soylent Green - a small green wafer which is advertised as being produced from "high-energy plankton". It is much more nutritious and palatable than the red and yellow varieties, but it is in short supply, which often leads to riots. 

Robert Thorn (New York City police detective who lives in a dilapidated, cramped one-room apartment with his aged partner Sol Roth (Edward G. Robinson). Roth is a former professor who searches through the now-disordered remnants of written records and books to help Thorn's investigations. Roth and his like are known as "books". He tells Thorn about the times before the ecological disaster and population crisis, when real food was plentiful, although Thorn is generally not interested in the "stories".

Thorn is assigned to investigate the murder of William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotten). When he goes to the crime scene, he finds Simonson lying in a pool of blood from being struck multiple times in the back of the head. Instead of looking for clues, the poorly-paid detective helps himself to some of the wealthy man's food, liquor, soap, and books.   He also romances Shirl (Leigh Taylor-Young), an attractive 24-year old prostitute (euphemistically known as "furniture") who comes with the luxury apartment. Thorn also meets Simonson's bodyguard, Tab Fielding (Chuck Connors), who claims that he was told to escort Shirl on a shopping trip when the attack took place.

Returning to his apartment, he gives Sol two large books he took from Simonson's apartment, the two-volume ''Soylent Oceanographic Survey Report, 2015 to 2019''. Thorn returns to work and talks to the Chief of Detectives, telling him that he suspects it may have been an assassination, since nothing was stolen from the apartment and the murder seemed professional. He finds it odd that the luxury apartment's sophisticated alarm and monitoring electronics happened to be inoperative on the night of the murder, and his bodyguard just happened to be out of the apartment at the time.

Thorn waits for Fielding to leave his apartment and then questions his "furniture," wandering about and discovering numerous signs of wealth, including "$150 a jar" strawberry jam. He returns to his own apartment to eat a meal of the purloined food, where Sol tells him that Simonson was a member of the board of directors of the Soylent Corporation, one of the most powerful corporations in the world. He then goes to question, and seduce, Shirl, who tells him that Simonson had become deeply troubled in the days before his death, even taking her to church. (In one memorable scene, Shirl entices Thorn with the offer to turn down the air conditioner [a convenience only accessible to the wealthy] and "make it cold like when there was a winter.") Thorn later attempts to question the priest about Simonson's confession, but the priest is almost catatonic and does not reveal anything. Fielding later murders the priest to ensure he never talks.

After Thorn begins to uncover evidence that Simonson may have been murdered, Governor Santini (Whit Bissell) instructs Thorn's superior officer, Lieutenant Hatcher (Brock Peters), to close the investigation. However, Thorn refuses, and continues his investigation into the murder. Later, when Thorn is on riot duty during the distribution of rations, Simonson's murderer fires several shots at Thorn, wounding him, but Thorn is able to push his attacker under a riot control vehicle and he escapes.

In the meantime, Roth goes over oceanographic reports that Thorn took from Simonson's apartment with other intellectuals at the "supreme exchange," a library of old books. By piecing together the information, they begin to suspect that the Soylent Corporation may be covering up a horrific conspiracy. Unable to live with what he has uncovered, Roth opts for euthanasia (euphemistically known as "going home") at a government clinic. There, he is taken to a comfortable bed, is given a poison-laced beverage, and is shown panoramic views of an unspoiled pristine Earth as he dies. Thorn tries to intervene, but he is too late to prevent Roth from dying. Nevertheless, during Roth's final moments, he asks Thorn to find proof about the horrible truth that he suspects about Soylent Green. 

After Roth dies, Thorn sneaks into the basement of the euthanasia facility, where he sees corpses being loaded onto waste disposal trucks. He secretly hitches a ride on one of the trucks, which drives to a heavily guarded waste disposal plant. Once inside the plant, Thorn sees how the corpses are processed into Soylent Green wafers. After Thorn escapes from the plant and heads for the supreme exchange with the information, he is ambushed by Fielding and several other gunmen. In the shootout, Thorn kills some of the gunmen, but is himself wounded and retreats into a cathedral filled with homeless people. After a desperate fight, Thorn stabs and kills Fielding. When police backup arrives, the seriously wounded and nearly hysteric Thorn confides to Hatcher the horrible secret behind Soylent Green and urges him to spread the word.

==Film production==
The screenplay was based on a 1966 novel ''Make Room! Make Room!'', which is set in the year 1999, with the theme of overpopulation and overuse of resources leading to increasing poverty, food shortages, and social disorder as the next millennium approaches. While the book refers to "soylent steaks", it makes no reference to "Soylent Green", the processed food rations depicted in the film. The book's title was not used for the movie since it might have confused audiences into thinking it was a big-screen version of ''Make Room for Daddy''.<ref>http://www.iol.ie/~carrollm/hh/soycann.htm</ref>

The director Richard Fleischer, who began by shooting film noir thrillers after WWII, learned to do special effects in the 1950s and 1960s when he did a number of Walt Disney films such as ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' and ''Fantastic Voyage'' (1966). In the years before and after ''Soylent Green'', Fleisher did films centering on famous serial killers and capital punishment (1968's ''The Boston Strangler'' and 1971's ''10 Rillington Place'') and the controversial and provocative Che Guevara biopic ''Che!''(1969).

This was the 101st and last movie in which The Ten Commandments'' (1956). The female lead character, Shirl (Leigh Taylor-Young), is briefly seen playing a ''Computer Space'' arcade game, an early depiction of the 1970s pop culture phenomenon of videogames.

===Music===
In the film, after the aged Roth learns the truth about Soylent Green, he decides he can no longer deal with the world, and states that he is "going home". By this, he means that he is going to sign up for government-provided euthanasia. When Roth arrives at the clinic, he is asked to select a lighting scheme and a type of music for the euthanasia chamber. Roth selects orange-hued lights and "light Classical music." When he goes to the euthanasia chamber, a selection of Classical music plays through speakers and films are projected on large screens.

The "going home" score in this part of the film was conducted by Symphony No. 6'' ("Pathétique") by Tchaikovsky; ''Symphony No. 6'' ("Pastoral") by Beethoven; "Morning Mood" and "Åse's Death" from the ''Peer Gynt Suite'' by Edvard Grieg. As the music plays, scenes of majestic natural beauty are projected on film screens: "deer in woods, trees and leaves, sunsets beside the sea, birds flying overhead, rolling streams, mountains, fish and coral, sheep and horses, and lots and lots of flowers — from daffodils to dogwoods". Amidst the music and the scenes of nature, Roth remembers the world as it once was, and peacefully takes his last breath.

==Analysis and impact==
===Thematic analysis===

In the film, police detective Thorn is a "prophet of doom" who learns of the "most horrifying results" of the overpopulation and environmental disaster. In addition to being a prophet, "Thorn is a pioneer, a tragic hero willing to speak up and resist homogenizing forces as an individual." In the film's depiction of corporate corruption and police complicity in the cover-up, Thorn's "morality transcends all those around him" as he becomes the "sole voice of reason" as he "stands alone". After Thorn learns of the use of cadavers to make food rations, his main concern is with the future implications: that the Soylent food company will eventually "raise humans like cattle". After Thorn is shot by Soylent Corporation gunmen, he appears to be dying, and so his warnings about the horrors he witnessed in the Soylent plant "seem to be his last", making him a classic "tragic hero".<ref name="Jumpcut"></ref>
