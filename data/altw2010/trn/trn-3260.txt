==Synopsis==
Many centuries ago, an evil spirit, Dai Shi, roamed freely across the Earth, waging a "Beast War" against the humans. Fortunately, through valiant fighting, the Order of the Claw, a group of kung fu martial artists, part of the Pai Zhuq, were able to conquer the evil spirit and have since been able to keep him locked away. The secret of their prisoner and their duty to keep him under control was passed along from generation to generation of Pai Zhuq members, three of which charged with keeping the Dai Shi from being released.

Now, in the present day, Dai Shi has escaped and three new warriors have been selected by the Pai Zhuq to find and destroy the evil Dai Shi. The three teen warriors must go to where Dai Shi's ancient palace is located, a land once uninhabited, now known as Ocean Bluff. In their new home, the teen warriors must assume normal lives working at a pizza parlor under the guidance of their boss and new kung fu master, R.J., who gives them the power to morph into the Power Rangers.<ref name="TDpressreleaseD"></ref>

}}'''''Power Rangers: Jungle Fury''''' is de titel van het zestiende seizoen van de Amerikaanse Tokusatsuserie Power Rangers. 

Het seizoen ging in première op 18 februari 2008, en is gebaseerd op de Super Sentai serie  ''Juken Sentai Gekiranger''. 

== Verhaal ==
Vele eeuwen geleden vocht de kwade geest Dai Shi tegen de mensheid in een oorlog die tegenwoordig bekend staat als de “beestoorlog”. Hij werd verslagen door de Orde van de Klauw, een groep kungfu-meesters die de krachten van dieren gebruikten. Ze sloten hem op in een kisten bewaakten die in de eeuwen erop.

In het jaar 2008 heeft de Orde een academie opgericht genaamd de Pai Zhuq academy. Hier leren nieuwe studenten de eeuwenoude vechtkunst van de originele leden van de Orde. Om de paar jaar worden de beste drie studenten uitgekozen om Dai Shi te bewaken. De drie meest recente uitverkorenen zijn Jarrod, Theo en Lily. Jarrod wordt vanwege zijn arrogantie echter op het laatste moment vervangen door Casey. 

Door Jarrod's toedoen kan Dai Shi ontsnappen. Hij neemt bezit van Jarrod’s lichaam, en begint meteen zijn leger weer op te bouwen om verder te gaan waar hij was gestopt. Om Dai Shi te verslaan en weer op te sluiten stuurt Master Mao, die bij Dai Shi's ontsnapping dodelijk gewond raakte,  Casey, Theo en Lily naar een andere meester, R.J. HIj geeft hen morphers waarmee ze de Jungle Fury Power Rangers kunnen worden.

De rangers winnen de eerste gevechten tegen Dai Shi's leger. Hierop brengt Dai Shi de drie overlords weer tot leven in de hoop dat zij hem kunnen trainen tot een sterkere krijger. Ondertussen ondergaan de rangers extra training bij andere leden van de Orde van de Klauw om zo nieuwe gevechtstechnieken te leren. Na in de geestwereld te zijn getraind door de geesten van drie overleden meesters, kunnen de rangers veranderen in een sterkere vorm genaamd Jungle Master Mode.

*'''Casey''': de Rode Ranger. Hij was eigenlijk Master Mao’s tweede keuze om de Rode Ranger te worden, en is derhalve in het begin erg onzeker over zijn nieuwe taak. Hij beheerst de Tiger spirit.<ref name="characters">[http://tv.disney.go.com/jetix/junglefury/characters/index.html JETIX - Power Rangers Jungle Fury Characters]</ref>

Hoewel hij er net zo uit ziet, is hij een Kung Fu meester en eveneens lid van de Orde van de claw. Later in de serie wordt hij zelfde paarse ranger.

*'''Master Mao''': de oude leraar van de Rangers toen ze nog op de academie zaten. Hij koos Casey, Theo en Lily uit om de nieuwe Rangers te worden. Hij werd gedood door Dai Shi, maar verschijnt nog geregeld aan de Rangers als geest om hen bij te staan.
