The '''First Day of the Battle of Gettysburg''', Confederate General Union Maj. Gen. George G. Meade), but it soon escalated into a major battle which culminated in the outnumbered and defeated Union forces retreating to the high ground south of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

The first-day battle proceeded in three phases as combatants continued to arrive at the battlefield. In the morning, two brigades of Confederate Maj. Gen. Lt. Gen. Third Corps) were delayed by dismounted Union cavalrymen under Brig. Gen. I Corps, the Confederate assaults down the Chambersburg Pike were repulsed, although Gen. Reynolds was killed. By early afternoon, the Union XI Corps had arrived, and the Union position was in a semicircle from west to north of the town. The Confederate Second Corps under Lt. Gen. Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division attacking from Oak Hill and Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's division attacking across the open fields north of town. The Union lines generally held under extremely heavy pressure, although the salient at Barlow's Knoll was overrun.

The third phase of the battle came as Rodes renewed his assault from the north and Heth returned with his entire division from the west, accompanied by the division of Maj. Gen. Dorsey Pender. Heavy fighting in Herbst's Woods (near the Lutheran Theological Seminary) and on Oak Ridge finally caused the Union line to collapse. Some of the Federals conducted a fighting withdrawal through the town, suffering heavy casualties and losing many prisoners; others simply retreated. They took up good defensive positions on Cemetery Hill and waited for additional attacks. Despite discretionary orders from Robert E. Lee to take the heights "if practicable," Richard Ewell chose not to attack. Historians have debated ever since how the battle might have ended differently if he had found it practicable to do so.

==Morning==
===Defense by Buford's cavalry===

General Buford realized the importance of the high ground directly to the south of Gettysburg. He knew that if the Confederates could gain control of the heights, Meade's army would have a hard time dislodging them.<ref>Martin, pp. 47-48, asserts that Buford was primarily concerned with the defense of the town itself, and while he had an innate understanding of the value of high ground, there is no evidence that he visited Cemetery Hill, Culp's Hill, or the Round Tops, or formally considered them as defensive ground for Meade's army.</ref> He decided to utilize three ridges west of Gettysburg: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge, and Seminary Ridge (proceeding west to east toward the town). These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town,  XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) to follow closely behind.<ref>Martin, pp. 43, 49. Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 41-42.</ref>

Confederate Maj. Gen. William Gamble's cavalry brigade. The first shot of the battle was claimed to be fired by 8th Illinois Cavalry, fired at an unidentified man on a gray horse over a half-mile away; the act was merely symbolic.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 52-56. Martin, pp. 63-64.</ref> Buford's 2,748 troopers would soon be faced with 7,600 Confederate infantrymen, deploying from columns into line of battle.<ref>Eicher, p. 510.</ref>

Gamble's men mounted determined resistance and delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading Sharps, Burnside, and others.</ref> It is a modern myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, they were able to fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 57, 59, 74. Martin, pp. 82-88, 96-97.</ref>

===Davis versus Cutler===
thumb|350px|Davis vs. Cutler, 10:00&ndash;10:45 a.m.
The morning infantry fighting occurred on either side of the Chambersburg Pike, mostly on McPherson Ridge. To the north, an unfinished railroad bed opened three shallow cuts in the ridges. To the south, the dominant features were Willoughby Run and Herbst Woods (sometimes called McPherson Woods, but they were the property of John Herbst). Brig. Gen. Lysander Cutler's Union brigade opposed Davis's brigade; two of Cutler's regiments were north of the Pike, two to the south. To the left of Cutler, Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith's Iron Brigade opposed Archer.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 60. Martin, p. 103.</ref>

General Reynolds directed both brigades into position and placed guns from the Maine battery of Capt. James A. Hall where Calef's had stood earlier.<ref>Martin, pp. 102, 104.</ref> While the general rode his horse along the east end of Herbst Woods, shouting "Forward men! Forward for God's sake, and drive those fellows out of the woods," he fell from his horse, killed instantly by a bullet striking him behind the ear. (Some historians believe Reynolds was felled by a sharpshooter, but it is more likely that he was killed by random shot in a volley of rifle fire directed at the 2nd Wisconsin.) Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday assumed command of the I Corps.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 77-78. Martin, pp. 140-43.</ref>

On the right of the Union line, three regiments of Cutler's brigade were fired on by Davis's brigade before they could get into position on the ridge. Davis's line overlapped the right of Cutler's, making the Union position untenable, and Wadsworth ordered Cutler's regiments back to Seminary Ridge. The commander of the 147th New York, Lt. Col. Francis C. Miller, was shot before he could inform his troops of the withdrawal, and they remained to fight under heavy pressure until a second order came. In under 30 minutes, 45% of Gen. Cutler's 1,007 men became casualties, with the 147th losing 207 of its 380 officers and men.<ref name=Pfanz13>Pfanz, ''Battle of Gettysburg'', p. 13.</ref> Some of Davis's victorious men turned toward the Union positions south of the railroad bed while others drove east toward Seminary Ridge. This defocused the Confederate effort north of the pike.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 81-90.</ref>

===Archer versus Meredith===
thumb|350px|Archer vs. Meredith, 10:45 a.m.
South of the pike, Archer's men were expecting an easy fight against dismounted cavalrymen and were astonished to recognize the black Hardee hats worn by the men facing them through the woods: the famous Iron Brigade, formed from regiments in the Western states of Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin, had a reputation as fierce, tenacious fighters. As the Confederates crossed Willoughby Run and climbed the slope into Herbst Woods, they were enveloped on their right by the longer Union line, the reverse of the situation north of the pike.<ref>Martin, pp. 149-61. Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 91-98. Pfanz, ''Battle of Gettysburg'', p. 13.</ref>

Brig. Gen. Archer was captured in the fighting, the first general officer in Robert E. Lee's army to suffer that fate. Archer was most likely positioned around the 14th Tennessee when he was captured by Private Patrick Moloney of Company G., 2nd Wisconsin, "a brave patriotic and fervent young Irishman." Archer resisted capture, but Moloney overpowered him. Moloney was killed later that day, but he received the Medal of Honor for his exploit. When Archer was taken to the rear, he encountered his former Army colleague Gen. Doubleday, who greeted him good-naturedly, "Good morning, Archer! How are you? I am glad to see you!" Archer replied, "Well, I am ''not'' glad to see ''you'' by a damn sight!"<ref>Martin, pp. 160-61. Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 100-01.</ref>

===Railroad cut===
thumb|350px|Fighting at the railroad cut, 11:00 a.m.
At around 11 a.m., Doubleday sent his reserve regiment, the 6th Wisconsin, commanded by Lt. Col. Rufus R. Dawes, north in the direction of Davis's disorganized brigade. The Wisconsin men paused at the fence along the pike and fired, which halted Davis's attack on Cutler's men and caused many of them to seek cover in the railroad cut. The 6th was joined by the 95th New York and the 84th New York (also known as the 14th Brooklyn) along the pike.<ref name=Pfanz13 /> The three regiments charged to the railroad cut, where Davis's men were seeking cover. The majority of the 600-foot (180 m) cut (shown on the map as the center cut of three) was too deep to be an effective firing position&mdash;as deep as 15 feet (4.5 m).<ref>Martin, p. 125.</ref> Making the situation more difficult was the absence of their overall commander, General Davis, whose location was unknown.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 102-14.</ref>

Dawes's men nevertheless faced daunting fire as they charged toward the cut. The regiment's enfilading fire from both ends of the cut, and many Confederates considered surrender. Colonel Dawes took the initiative by shouting "Where is the colonel of this regiment?" Major John Blair of the 2nd Mississippi stood up and responded, "Who are you?" Dawes replied, "I command this regiment. Surrender or I will fire."<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 112.</ref> Dawes later described what happened next:<ref>Martin, p. 131.</ref>

Despite this surrender, leaving Dawes standing awkwardly holding seven swords, the fighting continued for minutes more and numerous Confederates were able to escape back to Herr Ridge. The three Union regiments lost 390-440 of 1,184 engaged, but they had blunted Davis's attack, prevented them from striking the rear of the Iron Brigade, and so overwhelmed the Confederate brigade that it was unable to participate significantly in combat for the rest of the day. The Confederate losses were about 500 killed and wounded and over 200 prisoners out of 1,707 engaged.<ref>Martin, p. 140.</ref>

==Mid-day lull==
thumb|350px|Disposition of forces, 12:30 p.m.
By 11:30 a.m., the battlefield was temporarily quiet. On the Confederate side, Henry Heth faced an embarrassing situation. He had been under orders from General Lee to avoid a general engagement until the full Army of Northern Virginia had concentrated in the area. But his excursion to Gettysburg, ostensibly to find shoes, essentially a reconnaissance in force conducted by a full infantry division, had indeed started a general engagement and he was on the losing side of it so far. By 12:30 p.m., his remaining two brigades, under Brig. Gen.  Dorsey Pender, also from Hill's Corps. Hill's remaining division (Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson) did not arrive until late in the day.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 117-19. Martin, pp. 186-89.</ref>

Considerably more Confederate forces were on the way, however. Two divisions of the Second Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen.  Carlisle and  York. The five brigades of Maj. Gen.  Edward "Allegheny" Johnson) did not arrive until late in the day.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 148, 228. Martin, pp. 204-06.</ref>

On the Union side, Doubleday reorganized his lines as more units of the I Corps arrived. First on hand was the Corps Artillery under Col.  XI Corps arrived from the south before noon, moving up the Taneytown and Emmitsburg Roads. Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard was surveying the area from the roof of the Fahnestock Brothers' dry-goods store downtown at about 11:30<ref>Martin, p. 198. Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 137, estimates 10:30.</ref> when he heard that Reynolds had been killed and that he was now in command of all Union forces on the field. He recalled: "My heart was heavy and the situation was grave indeed, but surely I did not hesitate a moment. God helping us, we will stay here till the Army comes. I assumed the command of the field."<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 123, 124, 128, 137. Martin, p. 198.</ref>

Howard immediately sent messengers to summon reinforcements from the  III Corps (Maj. Gen.  XII Corps (Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum). Howard's first XI Corps division to arrive, under Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz, was sent north to take a position on Oak Ridge and link up with the right of the I Corps. (The division was commanded temporarily by Brig. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig while Schurz filled in for Howard as XI Corps commander.) The division of Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow was placed on Schurz's right to support him. The third division to arrive, under Brig. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr, was placed on Cemetery Hill along with two batteries of artillery to hold the hill as a rallying point if the Union troops could not hold their positions; this placement on the hill corresponded with orders sent earlier in the day to Howard by Reynolds just before he was killed.<ref>Martin, pp. 198-202. Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 137, 140, 216.</ref>

However, Rodes beat Schurz to Oak Hill, so the XI Corps division was forced to take up positions in the broad plain north of the town, below and to the east of Oak Hill.<ref>Pfanz, ''Battle of Gettysburg'', p. 15.</ref> They linked up with the I Corps reserve division of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson, whose two brigades had been sent forward by Doubleday when he heard about Ewell's arrival.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 130.</ref> Howard's defensive line was not a particularly strong one in the north.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 238.</ref> He was soon outnumbered (his XI Corps, still suffering the effects of their defeat at the Battle of Chancellorsville, had only 8,700 effectives), and the terrain his men occupied in the north was poorly selected for defense. He held out some hope that reinforcements from Slocum's XII Corps would arrive up the Baltimore Pike in time to make a difference.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 158.</ref>

==Afternoon==
thumb|350px|Rodes, Heth, and Early attack, 2:00 &ndash; 4:00 p.m.
In the afternoon, there was fighting both west (Hill's Corps renewing their attacks on the I Corps) and north (Ewell's Corps attacking the I and XI Corps) of Gettysburg. Ewell, on Oak Hill with Rodes, saw Howard's troops deploying before him, and he interpreted this as the start of an attack and implicit permission to set aside Gen. Lee's order not to bring about a general engagement.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 161-62.</ref>

===Rodes attacks from Oak Hill===
Rodes initially sent three brigades south against Union troops that represented the right flank of the I Corps and the left flank of the XI Corps: from east to west, Brig. Gen. George P. Doles, Col. Edward A. O'Neal, and Brig. Gen. Alfred Iverson. Doles's Georgia brigade stood guarding the flank, awaiting the arrival of Early's division. Both O'Neal's and Iverson's attacks fared poorly against the six veteran regiments in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Henry Baxter, manning a line in a shallow inverted V, facing north on the ridge behind the Mummasburg Road. O'Neal's men were sent forward without coordinating with Iverson on their flank and fell back under heavy fire from the I Corps troops.<ref>Martin, pp. 205-210. Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 163-66.</ref>

Iverson failed to perform even a rudimentary reconnaissance and sent his men forward blindly while he stayed in the rear (as had O'Neal, minutes earlier). More of Baxter's men were concealed in woods behind a stone wall and rose to fire withering volleys from less than  away, creating over 800 casualties among the 1,350 North Carolinians. Stories are told about groups of dead bodies lying in almost parade-ground formations, heels of their boots perfectly aligned. (The bodies were later buried on the scene, and this area is today known as "Iverson's Pits", source of many local tales of supernatural phenomena.)<ref>Martin, pp. 224-38. Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 170-78.</ref>

Baxter's brigade was worn down and out of ammunition. At 3:00 p.m. he withdrew his brigade, and Gen. Robinson replaced it with the brigade of Brig. Gen.  Dodson Ramseur. Ramseur attacked first, but Paul's brigade held its crucial position. Paul had a bullet go in one temple and out the other, blinding him permanently (he survived the wound and lived 20 more years after the battle). Before the end of the day, three other commanders of that brigade were wounded.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 182-84. Martin, pp. 247-55.</ref>

Daniel's North Carolina brigade then attempted to break the I Corps line to the southwest along the Chambersburg Pike. They ran into stiff resistance from Col. Roy Stone's Pennsylvania "Bucktail Brigade" in the same area around the railroad cut as the morning's battle. Fierce fighting eventually ground to a standstill.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 194-213. Martin, pp. 238-47.</ref>

thumb|300px|1863年的蓋茨堡，自路德神學院(Luthern Theological Seminary)方向遠眺城北。

美國內戰中的蓋茨堡之役，其開戰首日（1863年7月1日）發端於北維吉尼亞軍團（羅伯特·李將軍麾下）與波多馬克軍團（由喬治·米德將軍指揮）兩軍所屬孤立小單位之間的一場遭遇戰，而迅即逐步升級為大規模戰役。聯邦軍因寡不敵眾，撤至賓夕凡尼亞蓋茨堡南方的高地，而結束首日戰鬥。

==早晨==
=== 巴福德騎兵隊之抵禦 ===
thumb|300px|騎兵隊的遲滯作戰，7:00&ndash;10:00 a.m.
7月1日早晨，約翰·巴福德准將所部一師下轄之聯邦騎兵隊靜待自凱許城(Cashtown)方向朝西北行進的聯盟國步兵部隊。詹姆斯·培提古魯(James Johnston Pettigrew)准將所率領的聯盟國部隊於前一天曾與這支聯邦軍短暫相遇，但認為所遇到的是賓夕法尼亞州的民兵，而非掩護波多馬克軍團大軍行進的正規軍。

巴福德將軍體認到蓋茨堡正南方高地的重要性，明白該處一旦落入南軍控制，米德將軍必定得極為費力才能驅逐他們。他決定利用城西三道山脊：紳士山脊（Herr Ridge）、麥克佛森山脊（McPherson Ridge）、與神學院山脊（Seminary Ridge，三道山脊自西至東接近城區），依托有利的地形以自己的小部隊遲滯優勢的南方大軍，爭取時間以待步兵（由約翰·雷諾(John Fulton Reynolds)少將所率之第一兵團）抵達並佔據城南的有利防禦陣地，即墓地嶺（Cemetery Hill）、墓地山脊（Cemetery Ridge）、以及寇普嶺（Culp's Hill）。當日一早，指揮波多馬克軍團右翼部隊的雷諾將軍命令所部向巴福德將軍的駐地行進。奧利佛·豪爾（Oliver Otis Howard）少將所率領的第十一兵團緊隨其後。

聯盟國中將安伯洛斯·希爾(Ambrose Powell Hill)少將麾下之第三兵團所轄的亨利·海斯少將所部一師，以兩旅的兵力，各由詹姆斯·亞瑟（James Archer）及約瑟夫·戴維斯（Joseph R. Davis）兩位准將率領，分沿錢伯斯堡峰（Chambersburg Pike）兩側，成縱隊東進。早上7:30左右，海斯師的兩旅在城西三哩（5公里）處遭遇輕騎哨兵之輕微抵抗，於是佈署為戰鬥隊型。他們最終遭遇由威廉·坎伯（William Gamble）上校所率，當時已下馬作戰之騎兵旅。此役據信由伊利諾第八騎兵隊之馬塞盧斯·瓊斯(Marcellus E. Jones)上尉首開第一槍；他對著身處半哩外，跨騎灰馬的不明人士開火。此舉僅具象徵性意義。

在約翰·加列福(John H. Calef)上尉率合眾國第二砲兵隊Ａ砲兵連(Battery A of the 2nd U.S. Artillery)進行火力掩護下，坎伯上校的人馬果斷地作戰抵禦，手持夏普斯卡賓槍(Sharps carbine)於柵欄後以突發而精準的槍法發揮拖延戰術。這是戰役進行至當時為止，最慘烈的一場戰鬥。上午10:20，聯盟國軍抵達紳士山脊，並推進至聯邦軍東面的麥克佛森山脊，而詹姆斯·瓦斯渥斯(James Samuel Wadsworth)少將所部第一兵團之前鋒部隊終於抵達。部隊由約翰·雷諾(John Fulton Reynolds)少將所率，他與巴福德將軍簡短地協商過後便兼程趕回以帶領大批人馬前來。

=== 戴維斯對卡勒 ===

thumb|300px|戴維斯對卡勒，10:00&ndash;10:45 a.m.

當日上午，步兵部隊沿著錢伯斯堡峰兩側進行戰鬥，而主要集中於麥克佛森山脊。山脊以北有一條未完成的鐵道路基，分為三線，淺淺地切進山脊；其南方最顯著之地貌為威洛比小徑(Willoughby Run)與厄伯斯特樹林（Herbst Woods，又稱麥克佛森樹林，但實為約翰·厄伯斯特之產業）。林山德·卡勒(Lysander Cutler)准將所率一旅聯邦軍面對戴維斯轄下之旅；卡勒所部有兩團位於峰北，兩團位於峰南，其左側為所羅門·瑪瑞迪斯（Solomon Meredith）准將所率之鐵旅（Iron Brigade），面對亞瑟之旅。

雷諾(Reynolds)將軍指揮所部兩旅就戰鬥位置，並將詹姆斯·豪爾(James A. Hall)上尉的砲兵連之火力佈署於加列福(Calef)上尉原先據守之位置。雷諾將軍騎馬巡行厄伯斯特樹林東側，吆喝著：『兄弟們上啊！看在上帝的份上快上，把那些傢伙趕出樹林，』話未完便墜馬，因耳後遭子彈貫入而陣亡。（有歷史學家認為雷諾將軍是因遭狙擊手射殺而墜馬，但情況比較像是他誤中來自威斯康辛第二團亂槍齊發而四射的流彈。）由亞伯納·搭博戴（Abner Doubleday）少代行職權，指揮第一兵團。

戴維斯之旅在就戰鬥位置之前，即遭據守聯邦軍防線右側的卡勒旅轄下三個團開火射擊。戴維斯旅的戰線與卡勒的右翼重疊，使得聯邦軍立足不穩。瓦斯渥斯令卡勒率所領各團轉進與神學院山脊。不幸的是，紐約第147團指揮官弗朗西斯·米勒(Francis C. Miller)中校在下令全團撤退前即因中彈而告陣亡，所部在強大的壓力下持續奮戰，直至接獲第二道命令為止。在不到30分鐘內，卡勒將軍的部隊即傷亡45%，第147團的380名官兵中有207人罹難。戴維斯打勝仗的部隊中，有一部分攻向聯邦軍陣地以南的鐵道路基，而其他部隊則被迫西行，朝神學院山脊而去，如此使聯盟國在峰北的作戰失去重心。

=== 亞瑟對瑪瑞迪斯 ===

thumb|300px|亞瑟對瑪瑞迪斯, 10:45 a.m.

在山峰以南，亞瑟所部原本預期可輕易打敗下馬作戰的騎兵，卻愕然發現在樹林中接戰的士兵們頭戴黑色哈迪帽(Hardee hat)：他們遇上了名頭響亮的鐵旅(Iron Brigade)。鐵旅因其下轄各團自產鐵的西部各州組成而得名，亦譽其兇猛頑強的戰鬥作風。在聯盟國軍穿越威洛比小徑，仰登厄伯斯特樹林的同時，其右翼遭聯邦軍長長的戰線包圍，整體情況恰與峰北相反。

亞瑟將軍本人於作戰中被俘，為李將軍麾下第一位在此戰中如此結局的將軍。亞瑟將軍在遭威斯康辛第2團G連的『英勇愛國並充滿熱情的愛爾蘭人』派崔克·莫隆內(Patrick Moloney)大兵俘獲時，似正位於田納西第14團駐地附近。亞瑟將軍曾拒捕，但遭制伏。莫隆內於當日稍晚陣亡，但因功獲頒榮譽勳章(Medal of Honor)。亞瑟將軍在遭後送時，遇上昔日同袍搭博戴將軍愉快自然的問候：『早啊，亞瑟！你好嗎？真高興見到你！』亞瑟將軍回敬道：『哦，我真他媽的「不」高興見到「你」！』

===鐵道切口===

thumb|300px|作戰於鐵道切口，11:00 a.m.

早上11點左右，搭博戴將軍將其預備隊，由魯孚·道斯(Rufus Dawes)中校所指揮的威斯康辛第6團，調至亂成一團的戴維斯旅之北。這些威斯康辛士兵據沿峰設立的柵欄開火，打斷戴維斯對卡勒的攻擊，迫其大部進入鐵道切口尋找掩敝。威斯康辛第6團在與紐約第95團與紐約第84團（又名布魯克林第14團）會師後，攻入戴維斯所部正於其中找掩護的鐵道切口。對聯盟國軍極為不幸的是，這道600呎寬的大切口（圖中三道切口的中央一道），深達15英呎，以致無法有效發揮火力。戴維斯將軍當時的位置不明，無法聯繫上指揮官使情況更形惡化。

儘管如此，道斯所部於衝鋒至切口內時仍遭遇令人止步的兇猛火力。攻方的美國國旗在衝鋒中倒下至少三次。有一次，道斯本人，在一名旗隊士官自其手中奪取墜落的國旗前，搶先一步拿下。由於兩軍戰線接近，聯邦軍的側翼回折成倒V字型。聯邦軍士兵攻抵鐵道切口時，爆發了猛烈的徒手肉搏及刺刀戰。

聯邦軍自切口兩端傾注縱射火力，許多聯盟國士兵考慮著就地投降。道斯中校對他們呼喊道：『團長在哪裡？』密西西比第二團的約翰·布萊爾(John Blair)少校起身回應：『閣下何人？』道斯答以：『本團歸我指揮。立即投降，不然我便下令開火。』道斯稍後描述了後來發生的事。

:『那名軍官一語不發，將刺刀交給我作為回應。而其他槍上仍上著刺刀的部下們，跟著丟下手中的毛瑟槍。其冷靜與鎮定抑制了我方大軍槍砲齊發，拯救了敵軍幾百條性命。當我的心情自此可怕刺激的一刻平復後，我至感驚奇。』

道斯手握七支刺刀，姿勢笨拙地站著受降，但戰事繼續進行了數分鐘，聯盟國軍部分逃回至紳士山脊。聯邦軍三個團一共報告俘獲七名聯盟國軍官，以及225名聯盟國士兵，包含87名密西西比第二團的官兵。實際的數目顯然更高，因為並未計入轉交給聯邦騎兵隊的俘虜。戴維斯將軍於戰爭結束數年後，承認在該切口中失去了一名少校與八九十名的官兵。

== 日中暫歇 ==

thumb|300px|軍力部署, 12:30 p.m.

早上11:30，戰場沉寂了一陣子。聯盟國的亨利·海斯面對左右為難的情勢。李將軍曾下令在北維吉尼亞軍團全軍集結之前避免全面開戰，但他基本上由一整個步兵師所組成的火力偵搜部隊已抄至蓋茨堡；表面上是要找鞋類補給，實際上已全力進行一場遭遇戰，且至當時為止已落居下風。下午12:30，他手中所餘的兩個旅，分由詹姆斯·培提古魯(James Johnston Pettigrew)准將及約翰·布洛肯布羅(John Mercer Brockenbrough)上校率領，抵達現場。同屬希爾兵團轄下，由威廉·潘德(William Dorsey Pender)少將所領的一師（四個旅）也同時開到。希爾兵團的另外一師（由理查·安德森( Richard Heron Anderson)少將所率）當日稍晚方能抵達。

兵力可觀的聯盟國增援部隊已在途中。理查·尤爾（Richard Stoddert Ewell）中將麾下的第二兵團兩個師由賓夕法尼亞的卡萊爾(Carlisle)及約克鎮(York)，自北而南向蓋茨堡進軍。羅伯特·羅德斯(Robert Emmett Rodes)所部五個旅沿卡萊爾公路行軍，於到達城區之前脫離公路，進入蓊鬱的樺樹山脊(Oak Ridge)，以接上希爾兵團的左翼。具伯·爾利（Jubal Anderson Early）少將所部四個旅沿哈利斯堡公路行進。聯邦騎兵隊位於城北的警戒部隊偵知兩支部隊的移動情形。尤爾兵團另外的一師（由愛德華·強森(Edward "Allegheny" Johnson)少將率領）於當日稍晚抵達。

聯邦軍的搭博戴將軍於第一兵團轄下更多軍隊開抵後，重整防線。首先納入掌握的是查爾斯·溫賴特(Charles Wainwright)上校所率的砲兵隊，隨後是搭博戴所部，現由湯瑪斯·羅利准將所領一師下轄的兩個旅，由搭博戴將軍分別布署於防線兩側。第十一兵團於正午前由南方開到，北上坦尼城(Taneytown)及埃米茨堡(Emmitsburg)兩條公路。上午11:30左右，奧利佛·豪爾(Oliver Otis Howard)少將聞知雷諾將軍陣亡，而他接掌聯邦軍戰地總指揮後，登上位於市中心的法恩史達克兄弟(Fahnestock Brothers)南北雜貨店屋頂瞭望全局。他回憶道：

<blockquote>
我心情沉重，而局勢凶險，但我未有片刻遲疑。天佑我等，我軍定堅守此地直至大軍抵達。我接任戰地總指揮。

豪爾立派傳令兵至第三兵團（由丹尼爾·席寇斯( Daniel Edgar Sickles)少將領軍）與第十二兵團（由亨利·史羅坎( Henry Warner Slocum)少將率領）召請援軍。豪爾的第六兵團下個開到的師，由卡爾·舒茨(Carl Schurz)指揮，北調據守樺樹山脊，並連結第一兵團之右翼。（舒茨代豪爾為第六兵團司令期間，該師暫交亞歷山大·舒門爾分尼(Alexander Schimmelfennig)准將指揮）。佛朗西斯·巴羅（Francis Channing Barlow）准將所部一師佈防於舒茨之右，以為依托。第三個到達的師由阿道夫·馮·史丹維爾(Adolph von Steinwehr)領軍，與兩連的砲兵共同駐紮於墓園嶺，作為聯邦軍後撤時的集結點。嶺上的兵力配置與早先雷諾將軍陣亡前下達給豪爾將軍的命令相符。

豪爾的計畫未成，羅德斯敗舒茨於樺樹嶺，故第十一兵團各師被迫退守樺樹嶺以東，位於城北寬闊平原上的據點，連結約翰·羅賓森(John Cleveland Robinson)准將所率的第一兵團預備部隊。搭博戴於聞知尤爾所部開到後，頂上了預備部隊全師兩個旅。豪爾建構的北面防線不夠強大，他很快就要面臨優勢的敵軍（他的第十一兵團仍未自錢瑟勒斯維爾之役（Chancellorville）之敗中恢復，僅有8,700員可戰之兵），而他的部隊在北面防線各據點的地形，就防守而言，是糟糕的選擇。僅能希望史羅坎的第十二兵團能及時趕抵固守。

當日下午，蓋茨堡西面（希爾兵團重整旗鼓，再攻第一兵團）北面（尤爾兵團攻擊第一與第六兵團）遭襲。尤爾，連同羅德斯，於樺樹嶺見及豪爾的部隊正在當前佈防，於是展開攻擊，打斷敵軍的部署，默許將李將軍不展開大規模遭遇戰的命令放到一邊。

=== 羅德斯自樺樹嶺進攻 ===

羅德斯一開始派遣三個旅南攻位於第一兵團右翼與第十一兵團左翼的聯邦軍，自東至西由喬治·杜勒斯(George P. Doles)准將、愛德華·歐尼爾(Edward Asbury O'Neal)上校與奧佛瑞德·艾佛森(Alfred Iverson)准將領軍。杜勒斯的喬治亞旅警戒側翼，等待爾利師到來。歐尼爾與艾佛森攻擊亨利·白斯特(Henry Baxter)准將所部一旅下轄的第六退伍軍人團，進展緩慢。第六團的防線置為淺淺的倒V字型，北朝曼瑪斯公路(Mummasburg Road)後的山脊。歐尼爾的部隊獨自推進，而未與位居側翼的艾佛森協同一致，因而在第一兵團強大的火力下敗退。

艾佛森於位居後方的情形下，與數分鐘之前的歐尼爾一般盲目前進，失於對前線作基本的增援。白斯特所部多隱敝於石牆與玫瑰叢後的樹林，在不到一百碼的距離內作毁滅性的齊射，造成北卡羅萊納旅的1,350名士兵中，傷亡800人。據傳其遺骸幾乎排列成閱兵隊型，其靴跟完全對齊。（所有屍骨稍後就地掩埋。今日，本區以『艾佛森墓穴』("Iverson's Pits")而知名，成為當地鄉野怪談之資。）
