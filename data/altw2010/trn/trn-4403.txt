'''Space medicine''' is the practice of medicine on astronauts in outer space.

==Who benefits from space medicine research?==
Astronauts are not the only ones who benefit from space medicine research. Several medical products have been developed that are space spinoffs, that is practical applications for the field of medicine arising out of the space program. Because of joint research efforts between NASA, the National Institutes on Aging (a part of the National Institutes of Health), and other aging-related organizations, space exploration has benefitted a particular segment of society, seniors. Evidence of aging related medical research conducted in space was most publicly noticeable during STS-95 (See below).

===Medical space spinoffs from the early space exploration years (pre-Mercury through Apollo projects)===

* Radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer. In conjunction with Cleveland Clinic, 
the cyclotron at NASA’s center in Cleveland, Ohio—which had been utilized for testing nuclear propulsion systems for air and space craft—was used in the first clinical trials for the treatment and evaluation of neutron radiation therapy for cancer patients. 

* Foldable walkers. Made from a lightweight metal material developed by NASA for aircraft and spacecraft, foldable walkers are portable and easy to manage. 

* Personal alert systems. These are emergency alert devices that can be worn by individuals who may require emergency medical or safety assistance. When a button is pushed, the device sends a signal to a remote location for help. To send the signal, the device relies on telemetry technology developed at NASA.

* CAT Scans and MRIs. These devices are used by hospitals to see inside the human body. Their development would not have been possible without the technology provided by NASA after it found a way to take better pictures of the Earth’s moon. 

* Muscle stimulator device. This device is used for ½ hour per day to prevent muscle atrophy in paralyzed individuals. It provides electrical stimulation to muscles which is equal to jogging three miles per week. Christopher Reeves used these in his therapy.

* Orthopedic evaluation tools. Equipment to evaluate posture, gait, and balance disturbances was developed at NASA, along with a radiation-free way to measure bone flexibility using vibration.

* Diabetic foot mapping. This technique was developed at NASA’s center in Cleveland, Ohio to help monitor the effects of diabetes in feet. These efforts helped 

* Foam cushioning. Special foam used for cushioning astronauts during liftoff is used in pillows and mattresses at many nursing homes and hospitals to help prevent ulcers, relieve pressure, and provide a better night’s sleep.

* Kidney dialysis machines. These machines rely on technology developed by NASA in order to process and remove toxic waste from used dialysis fluid.

* Talking wheelchairs. Paralyzed individuals who have difficulty speaking may use a talking feature on their wheelchairs which was developed by NASA to create synthesized speech for aircraft. 

* Collapsible, lightweight wheelchairs. These wheelchairs are designed for portability and can be folded and put into trunks of cars. They rely on synthetic materials that NASA developed for its air and space craft

* Surgically implantable heart pacemaker. These devices depend on technologies developed by NASA for use with satellites. They communicate information about the activity of the pacemaker, such as how �much time remains before the batteries �need to be replaced.

* Implantable heart defibrillator. This tool continuously monitors heart activity and �can deliver an electric shock to restore heartbeat regularity.

* EMS Communications. Technology used to communicate telemetry between Earth and space was developed by NASA to monitor the health of astronauts in space from the ground. Ambulances use this same technology to send information—like EKG readings—from patients in transport to hospitals. This allows faster and better treatment.

* Weightlessness. While not an invention per se, the weightlessness of space one day may allow individuals with limited mobility on Earth--even those normally confined to wheelchairs--the freedom to move about with ease. A notable individual to take advantage of weightlessness in the "Vomit Comet" during 2007 was physicist Stephen Hawking.

===Major historical medical investigations in space during the Space Shuttle era===
====STS-95====

John Glenn, the first American astronaut to orbit the Earth, returned with much fanfare to space once again at 77 years of age to confront the physiological challenges preventing long-term space travel for astronauts—loss of bone density, loss of muscle mass, balance disorders, sleep disturbances, cardiovascular changes, and immune system depression—all of which are problems confronting aging people as well as astronauts. Once again Glenn stepped forward to play an historic role in the future of space exploration, but this time he would provide new medical research in the field of gerontology as well. 

==What are the effects of space on the body?==

===Decompression sickness===
====Decompression illness in spaceflight====

In space, astronauts use a extra-vehicular activities (EVAs). Spacesuits are generally inflated with 100% oxygen at a total pressure that is less than a third of normal atmospheric pressure.  Eliminating inert atmospheric components such as nitrogen allows the astronaut to breathe comfortably, but also have the mobility to use their hands, arms, and legs to complete required work, which would be more difficult in a higher pressure suit.

After the astronaut dons the spacesuit, air is replaced by 100% oxygen in a process called a "nitrogen purge". In order to reduce the risk of outgas nitrogen slowly enough that bubbles are not formed. When the astronaut returns to the "shirt sleeve" environment of the spacecraft after an EVA, pressure is restored to whatever the operating pressure of that spacecraft may be, generally normal atmospheric pressure. Decompression illness in spaceflight consists of decompression sickness (DCS) and other injuries due to uncompensated changes in pressure, or barotrauma.

====Decompression sickness====

Decompression sickness is the injury to the tissues of the body resulting from the presence of nitrogen bubbles in the tissues and blood. This occurs due to a rapid reduction in ambient pressure causing the dissolved nitrogen to come out of solution as gas bubbles. In space the risk of DCS is significantly reduced by using a technique to wash out the nitrogen in the body’s tissues. This is achieved by breathing 100% oxygen for a specified period of time before donning the spacesuit, and is continued after a nitrogen purge. DCS may result from inadequate or interrupted pre-oxygenation time, or other factors including the astronaut’s level of hydration, physical conditioning, prior injuries and age. Other risks of DCS include inadequate nitrogen purge in the EMU, a strenuous or excessively prolonged EVA, or a loss of suit pressure. Non-EVA crewmembers may also be at risk for DCS if there is a loss of spacecraft cabin pressure.

Symptoms of DCS in space may include chest pain, shortness of breath, cough or pain with a deep breath, unusual fatigue, lightheadedness, dizziness, headache, unexplained musculoskeletal pain, tingling or numbness, extremities weakness, or visual abnormalities.

Primary treatment principles consist of in-suit repressurization to re-dissolve nitrogen bubbles, 100% oxygen to re-oxygenate tissues, and hydration to improve the circulation to injured tissues.

To date there have been no reported cases of DCS in the NASA space program.

====Barotrauma====

Barotrauma is the injury to the tissues of air filled spaces in the body as a result of differences in pressure between the body spaces and the ambient atmospheric pressure. Air filled spaces include the middle ears, parananal sinuses, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. One would be predisposed by a pre-existing upper respiratory infection, nasal allergies, recurrent changing pressures, dehydration, or a poor equalizing technique.

'''宇宙医学'''（うちゅういがく）とは宇宙空間、宇宙飛行下の諸条件が人体に及ぼす影響を解明し、その適性、順応、保護などを研究する学問。生理学的、心理学的研究が行われる。ロケット打ち上げや降下の際の加速度、放射線（宇宙線）、強い光線、高・低温からの人体の保護、宇宙船内での酸素濃度や気圧の変化、無重力状態下の生活と人体への影響、生活周期の乱れや孤独感、不安感などの精神的負荷など、研究内容は多岐にわたる。スペースシャトルや宇宙ステーション内での人為的活動を行なう際に、健康維持の方法を考察する。今後の宇宙開発の重要テーマでもある。

かつては、初期のクラーク作品に見られるように、宇宙の無重力空間に人間が進出したら重力に起因する様々な健康上の問題から解放され、長寿にもなるだろうという意見があったが、実際に有人ロケットが打ち上げられ、百日単位で宇宙に滞在する人間が出るようになると、様々な弊害が出ることが判明した。宇宙空間では重力がないため、重い体重を支える必要のない骨からカルシウムが溶け出したり（長期間生活すると止まるという説あり）、負荷がかからないため筋力が弱まって地上に降りると立つことも困難になるなどの現象が起きたのである。そのため、宇宙進出にあたっては、宇宙空間の特性に応じた医学が必要となった。
