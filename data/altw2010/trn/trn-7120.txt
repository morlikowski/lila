==Plot summary==

A bored young woman, a teenager, living in Santa Rosa, California, Charlotte "Charlie" Newton (Wright), is frustrated because nothing seems to be happening in her life and that of her family. Then, she receives wonderful news: her uncle (for whom she was named), Charlie Oakley (Cotten), her mother's brother, is arriving for a visit. 

Two men show up pretending to be photographers and journalists working on a national survey of the average American family. One of them speaks to Charlie privately, identifying himself as Detective Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey) and telling her that her uncle is one of two men who are suspected of being a serial killer known as the "Merry Widow Murderer". This murderer has a ''modus operandi'' of seducing, murdering and robbing wealthy widows. 

Young Charlie at first refuses to even consider that her uncle could be this person, but she cannot help noticing him acting strangely on several occasions. Particularly chilling is a family dinner conversation during which Uncle Charlie reveals his hatred of rich widows, comparing them to fat animals who deserve to be killed.

Young Charlie's growing suspicion soon becomes apparent to her uncle. He confronts her and admits that he is indeed the man the police are after. He begs her for help; she reluctantly agrees not to say anything, as long as he leaves soon, to avoid a horrible scandal in the town that would destroy her family, especially her mother, an emotionally fragile woman, who dearly loves and idolizes her younger brother.

Then news breaks that the second suspect was killed fleeing from the police, and is assumed to have been the guilty one. The detective Graham leaves. Uncle Charlie is satisfied at first, until he remembers that Young Charlie fully knows his secret. Soon, the young woman has a couple of near fatal accidents, falling down some very steep stairs, and being trapped in a closed garage with a car spewing exhaust fumes.

Uncle Charlie soon announces that he is leaving by train for San Francisco. As he departs, he forces young Charlie to stay on board, planning to murder her by pushing her off as soon as the train gets up to speed. Instead, in the ensuing struggle between them, he falls into the path of an oncoming train.  At his funeral Uncle Charlie is highly honored by the townspeople of Santa Rosa, who know nothing of his true identity. Jack has come back to comfort Charlie; she tells him she had withheld from him information about her uncle which would have confirmed him as the murderer, but Jack already knows and accepts that, realizing her difficult situation. They are a loving couple who both know too much about a horrible secret which will remain a secret.

==Production Notes==
''Shadow of a Doubt'' was both filmed and set in War American city.  Since Thornton Wilder wrote the original script, the story is set in a small American town, a popular setting of Wilder, but with an added Hitchcock touch to it. In Patrick McGilligan's biography of Hitchcock he said the film was perhaps the most American film that Hitchcock had made up to that time.

The opening scenes take place in the Central Ward of Newark, New Jersey. The city skyline and landmarks such as the Pulaski Skyway are featured in the opening shot.
