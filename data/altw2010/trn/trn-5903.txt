The African National Congress (ANC) had decided to launch a campaign of protests against pass laws.  These protests were to begin on March 31 1960, but the rival Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) decided to pre-empt the ANC by launching its own campaign ten days earlier because they believed that the ANC could not win the campaign, on March 21.<ref name="aboutArticle"></ref>

On March 21, a group of between 5,000 and 7,000 people converged on the local police station in the township of Sharpeville, offering themselves up for arrest for not carrying their pass books. This was part of a broader campaign organized by the PAC. There is evidence that the PAC used creative means to draw the crowd to the protest, including the cutting of telephone lines into Sharpeville, the distribution of pamphlets telling people not to go to work on the day, and coercion of bus drivers.<ref name="TRCReport"/> Regardless, most of the crowd were in favour of the protest.

By 10:00am, a large crowd had gathered, and the atmosphere was peaceful and festive. Fewer than 20 police officers were present in the station at the start of the protest.  Police and military used low-flying Sabre jet fighters to attempt to intimidate the crowd into dispersing, a tactic that had been successful at a similar protest on the same day at Evaton.<ref name="TRCReport"/> The police set up Saracen armoured vehicles in a line facing the protesters, and at 1:15 pm fired upon the crowd. 

===Reasons for firing===
Police reports claimed that members of the crowd threw stones at them, and that inexperienced police officers opened fire spontaneously. The police were armed with Stens and tear gas.  Lieutenant Colonel Pienaar, the commanding officer of the police forces at Sharpeville, denied giving any order to fire, and stated that he would not have done so. Nevertheless, his attitude towards the protest is revealed in his statement that ''"the Native mentality does not allow them to gather for a peaceful demonstration. For them to gather means violence."''<ref name="Reeves">{{cite web

The police continued firing even when the crowd had turned to run, and the majority of those killed and wounded were shot in the back.<ref name="TRCReport"/> There was no evidence that any of the crowd were armed. 

===Death and injury toll===
The official figure is that 69 people were killed including 8 women and 10 children, and over 180 injured, including 31 women and 19 children.<ref name="Reeves"/>

== Response ==
The uproar among blacks was immediate, and the following week saw demonstrations, protest marches, strikes, and riots around the country. On March 30 1960, the government declared a state of emergency, detaining more than 18,000 people.

Le '''Massacre de Sharpeville''' est relatif à la répression policière qui eu lieu le 21 mars 1960 à Sharpeville, un township (banlieue noire) de la ville de Vereeniging dans le Transvaal en Afrique du Sud. 

== Historique ==
En 1960, dans le cadre de la campagne nationale des mouvements noirs contre l'obligation du port du pass (passeport intérieur), les militants du jeune Congrès Pan Africain (PAC) immobilisèrent les transports en commun bloquant les banlieusards dans leur township. Ces derniers furent alors nombreux à venir manifester pacifiquement leur colère devant le commissariat pour y bruler leurs documents d'identités controversés. 

Débordés et barricadés dans leur petit immeuble, les policiers perdent leur sang froid, tirent sans sommation dans la foule et provoquent un massacre. On relève 79 morts et parmi les 178 blessés, un nombre très impressionnant de blessures par balles dans le dos.

L'émotion gagne le pays et provoque une onde de choc internationale mettant pour la première fois depuis longtemps l'Afrique du Sud sur le devant de la scène internationale. 

L'évènement déclenche une grève générale le ANC et le PAC et décréter l'état d'urgence. 

La répression sera brutale conduisant de nombreux militants noirs en prison ou en exil. 

En 1984, Sharpeville revient aux avants postes de l'actualité à la suite du lynchage d'un conseiller municipal noir. Cet évènement déclenche une vague de contestation et de manifestation dans tout le pays qui débouche en 1985 le durcissement des sanctions internationales imposées par l'ONU contre l'Afrique du Sud.
