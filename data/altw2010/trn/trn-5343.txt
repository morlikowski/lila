'''Wakefield''' is a city by the River Calder in West Yorkshire, England. It forms the urban core and administrative centre of the wider City of Wakefield metropolitan borough.

Its population was 76,886 in 2001.  The city's boundaries are subject to a wide range of definitions,<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/bound_map_page.jsp?first=true&u_id=10472878&c_id=10001043 Map of Historical Boundaries]</ref> and it is not clear what definition the census was using in its calculations.

Wakefield was dubbed the "Merrie City" in the Middle Ages.

==Etymology==
The name "Wakefield" is often said to derive from "Waca's field" - the field belonging to Waca. However, it is more likely to have evolved from Old English ''wacu'', meaning "a watch or wake", and ''feld'', an open field in which a wake was held.<ref></ref> In the Domesday Book of 1086, it was listed as Wachefeld.<ref></ref> also as Wachefelt.

==History==
thumb|left|Wakefield Westgate c1900
Much of what is now Wakefield, including Lupset, was held by William Earl Warenne, Earl of Surrey, as conferred on him by King William I.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=vO4GAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=earl+warenne+wakefield+yorkshire&source=web&ots=zHyItid2qF&sig=NgmkVHSzh4KIkcPFHyx4Re76s9A&hl=en The Yorkshire Archaeological Journal, 1886]</ref> As early as 1203 William Earl Warenne received a grant to have a market in Wakefield. Wakefield and its environs formed the caput of an extensive baronial holding by the Warennes that extended to Cheshire and Lancashire. The Warennes, and their feudal sublords, continued to hold the area until the 14th century, when it passed to Warenne heirs.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=LpERAv6AJ6YC&pg=PA250&lpg=PA250&dq=earl+warenne+wakefield+yorkshire&source=web&ots=Q7Y06goj2I&sig=HUB-amByjwWYr4wd0T0AJkd7kJQ&hl=en The Encyclopedia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, New York, 1911]</ref> Those Norman tenants also holding land in the region, and particularly at Lupset, included the Lyvet (Levett) family, who had given their name to the nearby hamlet of Hooton Levitt.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=BQ6VFXY__t8C&pg=RA2-PA418&lpg=RA2-PA418&dq=york+lyvet&source=web&ots=4mzXXP7BSu&sig=52ecQoqzRan3VUV3dwdj_uK18Ik&hl=en#PRA2-PA417,M1 Lupset, The Yorkshire Archaeological Journal, 1882]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=IrkHAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA92&lpg=RA1-PA92&dq=lyvet+king&source=web&ots=M8In8xicy-&sig=yHEh-Mt-Z15w6jeWwKiVMie9-Y8&hl=en Dodsworth's Yorkshire notes, the wapentake of Agbrigg, Roger Dodsworth, 1884]</ref>

In 1460, during the Wars of the Roses, the Duke of York was defeated near the city (then a town) in the Battle of Wakefield at Sandal Castle. The ruins of the castle can still be visited, and are a popular walking spot for locals.

Wakefield was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1848 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.

Wakefield Cathedral is a 14th century parish church, which was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century. There is also a 14th century Chantry Chapel, one of only four remaining in England.<ref>[http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/bridgechapels/bridgechapels.htm Bridge Chapels - Edward Green<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The chapel tops a buttress on a bridge over the River Calder.

The town was a centre for West Riding also provided many local jobs in the councils, courts and prison.

In the early 20th century, large areas of council housing were built on the fields that surrounded the town, and the formerly independent villages of Sandal Magna, Belle Vue and Agbrigg became suburbs of Wakefield.  As many of the new council estates depended on the expansion of coal-mining for their employment, the National Coal Board eventually became Wakefield's largest employer. The city was also surrounded by pit villages, but also by the old mill towns of Batley, Dewsbury and Ossett to the west.

Wakefield is known as the capital of the Morley and Rothwell as the other two. In July 2005 a statue was erected to celebrate this facet of Wakefield.

===Recent history===
As with most industrial areas, Wakefield suffered many years of decline. The glass and textile industries faded out in the 1970s and 1980s.  1984 Miners' Strike, there were still 15 pits in the rest of the district, and demonstrations in support of the strike frequently took place in the city.  The city suffered a double blow through the closure of local pits and the abolition of West Yorkshire County Council, which had been based in Wakefield; many local people had been employed in administration ever since the establishment of the old West Riding council. The city long remained a depressed area, but fortunes have risen recently and unemployment is now around the national average.

==Transport==
There are two railway stations in the city centre, Wakefield Westgate (trains mainly to Wakefield Kirkgate (trains to Sandal & Agbrigg" station on the East Coast Mainline, just to the south of the main Westgate station. Wakefield Westgate station is maintained by National Express East Coast (NXEC), who operate the Leeds-London service, and is manned with facilities such as secure car parking, ticket office and shops. In contrast, Wakefield Kirkgate station is unmanned, and there is no ticket office or machine.  Most of the windows at the front of the station are boarded-up, and the grade 2 listed<ref>[http://www.wakefield.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/EC7F3485-64A8-4D27-B478-7DB069212F91/0/Listed_buildings_26th_April_2005.pdf Current Listed Building Files.

Charles Bronson. Wakefield was originally built as a house of correction in 1594.  The former governor R.S. Duncan has suggested that the well know nursery rhyme Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush finds its origins at the prison. During its days as a female prison, the women convicts would supposedly take their children on exercise with them and sing the now well-known tune. The original tree is claimed to be still there today. The current prison was designated a dispersal prison in 1966 (longest of remaining original group). It is now a lifer main centre with the focus on serious sex offenders. The current governor is David R. Thompson, Director-General elect of Her Majesty's Prison Service.

==Social Housing==
In 2004, Wakefield's council tenants voted to transfer the entire council housing stock to a new registered social landlord, the registered charity Wakefield and District Housing (WDH)<ref>[http://www.wdh.co.uk/quicklinks/aboutus/Pages/default.aspx Wakefield and District Housing - About WDH]</ref>, although the properties concerned are still often referred to as "council houses".  Wakefield itself contains seven ex-council estates. The largest estate is Lupset, in the west; the others are Flanshaw, Plumpton, Peacock, Eastmoor, Portobello [known affectionately as "bella"] and Kettlethorpe.

WDH are working with partners such as Wakefield's Metropolitan District Council, to invest over £700 m regenerating the district and improving the houses. Improvements have been taking place since 2005 and to date over £150 m has been spent improving homes. In August 2007 WDH completed the first in a programme of new Social Housing developments, located at Chiltern Avenue in Whitwood.

WDH is building a reputation for excellent customer care, with the latest survey reporting 83% of tenants satisfied with the service being provided and 79% believing the services provided offer value for money. At its recent Audit Commission inspection WDH was awarded the highest level of award, three stars with excellent prospects for improvement. This was only the third time this award has been granted, and WDH were the first Northern Housing Association to receive it.

===Music===
The indie-punk band The Cribs are from Wakefield. Prior to their emergence, Jane McDonald was the most celebrated Wakefield born contributor to the music industry.

The '''''Wakefield Cathedral Choir''''' consists of boys, girls and men who perform at religious services, concerts and recitals at the cathedral. Choral Evensong with the boys is on Tuesdays and on Thursdays the boys are joined by the men. The girls perform Evensong on Wednesday evenings and Parish Eucharist on Sunday mornings. The boys and men also sing at Choral Eucharist and Evensong on Sundays.  The girls, on occasion, sing choral Eucharist or Evensong with the Lay Clerks on Thursday or Friday evenings.  Once each term, the boys and the girls swap their Sunday duties.

The choir, directed by Jonathan Bielby and assisted by Thomas Moore, is one of the most successful cathedral choirs in the UK, but paradoxically has also been described by many as 'Wakefield's best kept secret'. The choir have had appearances on 'Songs of Praise' and BBC Radio 3's 'Choral Evensong'.
