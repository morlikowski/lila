The '''Kamov Ka-50''' ''Black Shark'' (coaxial rotor system of the Russian army in 1995. It is currently manufactured by the Progress company of Arseniev. 

During the late-1990s, Kamov and Israeli Air Industries developed a tandem-seat cockpit version, the '''Kamov Ka-50-2''' ''Erdogan'' (Turkish for "''Born Warrior''"), to compete in Turkey's attack helicopter competition.  Kamov later designed another two-seat variant, the '''Kamov Ka-52''' ''Alligator'' (NATO reporting name: "Hokum B").

==Design and development==
The Ka-50 was designed to be small, fast, and agile to improve survivability and lethality. For minimal weight and size (thus maximal speed and agility) it was -- uniquely among gunships -- to be operated by a single pilot only. Kamov concluded after thorough research of helicopter combat in Afghanistan and other war zones that the typical attack mission phases of low-level approach, pop-up target acquisition, and weapon launch don't simultaneously demand navigation, maneuvering, and weapons operation of the pilot; and thus with well-designed support automation a single pilot can indeed carry out the entire mission alone. However, it is still an unanswered question whether in practice the rank and file of Black Shark pilots would nevertheless suffer from excess fatigue from this combined workload.

Like other Kamov's helicopters, it features Kamov's characteristic contra-rotating co-axial rotor system, which removes the need for the entire tail-rotor assembly and improves the aircraft's aerobatic qualities -- it can perform loops, rolls, and “the funnel” (circle-strafing) where the aircraft maintains a line-of-sight to target while flying circles of varying altitude, elevation, and airspeed around it. Using two rotors means that a smaller rotor with slower moving rotor tips can be used compared to a single rotor design. Since the speed of the advancing rotor tip is a primary limitation to the maximum speed of a helicopter, this allows a faster maximum speed than helicopters such as the AH-64. The elimination of the tail rotor is a qualitative advantage because the torque-countering tail rotor can use up to 30% of engine power. Furthermore, the vulnerable boom and rear gearbox are fairly common causes of helicopter losses in combat (as proven in Vietnam); the Black Shark's entire transmission presents a comparatively small target to ground fire. Kamov maintains that the co-axial drive assembly is built to survive hits from 23mm ammunition like the other vital parts of the helicopter. The zero native torque also allows the aircraft to be fairly immune to wind strength and direction, and to have an unsurpassed turn rate in all travel speed envelopes.

As the single seat configuration was considered too revolutionary to be discovered by NATO, false windows were painted on the first two prototypes.<ref>Eden, Paul. ''Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft''. p. 223, Amber Books, 2006. ISBN 1904687849.</ref>  The "windows" evidently worked as the first western reports of the aircraft were wildly inaccurate. According to the Air Force Magazine Soviet Aerospace Almanac 1989, the "DoD states that this helicopter has not been observed carrying antitank guided weapons. Instead, it is thought to have a primary air-to-air role (an assessment that is not universally accepted)... Like other combat helicopters, 'hokum' has a crew of two, in tandem, with an elevated rear seat."

For improved pilot survivability the Ka-50 is fitted with a NPP Zvezda K-37-800 ejection seat, which is a rare feature for a helicopter.[http://www.aeronautics.ru/archive/vvs/ka52-01.htm]  Before the rocket in the ejection seat kicks in, rotor blades are blown away by explosive charges in the rotor disc and the canopy is similarly jettisoned.

The first Ka-50 prototype was nicknamed "Werewolf", however Kamov's official name for the type is "Black Shark". As the Soviet Union's collapse vastly reduced military spending before Ka-50 could go into full-scale production, a relatively small number of these aircraft have been built. Reportedly Ka-50's development took place in record time, as Kamov had the forethought of placing liaison engineers at major component suppliers and systems subcontractors.

The Ka-50 and its modifications have been chosen as the special forces support helicopter while Mi-28 has become main army's gunship. The production of Ka-50 was recommenced in 2006.

===Ka-50-2 Erdogan===

In 1997, Israeli Air Industries (IAI) in cooperation with the Turkish design competition for a $4 billion contract for 145 (later changed to 50) combat helicopters. The helicopter designed for the competition became the Ka-50-2 ''Erdogan'', a tandem cockpit twin-seater variant of the Ka-50 that featured a modern, Israeli-made "glass cockpit" avionics and a turret-mounted side-folding (for landing clearance) 30mm cannon as opposed to the fixed cannon of the Ka-50. (A similar Italian turret is also offered as a modification to the Ka-50.) The Erdogan beat the Eurocopter and Apache helicopters, but lost to an improved version of AH-1 Cobra. At the end the contract went to the Italian A-129 Mangusta.[http://www.defense-update.com/newscast/0407/news/020407_a129.htm] Kamov is still looking for a buyer, since the Russian military doesn't have the funding to purchase it themselves.

===Ka-50N and Ka-50Sh===

Because of limited night-time capability of the original Ka-50 "Shkval" TV sighting and targeting system, modified versions of single-seat Ka-50 were built. They were named Ka-50N ("Nochnoy", rus. "Night") and Ka-50Sh ("Shar", rus. "Sphere" - because of spherical FLIR turret). Many variants were tried, on some original "Shkval" was supplemented by thermal imaging system, while on others - completely replaced by "Samshite" day-and-night system (also used on Ka-52), including French SAGEM or Thomson thermal imagers. None of those entered mass production so far.

===Ka-52===

The '''Ka-52''' is another modification of the basic Ka-50 design. It features a two-place side-by-side cockpit and is designed to detect targets and redistribute them among supporting Ka-50. In comparison to the original Ka-50, it has a somewhat "softer" nose profile due to the wider cockpit, reduced cockpit armor, and large nose-mounted radome. Equipment includes radar with two antennas - mast-mounted for aerial targets and nose-mounted for ground targets, and "Samshite" day-and-night TV/thermal sighting system in two spherical turrets (one over the cockpit and second under the nose). The Ka-52 retains the side mounted cannon and six wing mounted hardpoints of the original Ka-50.<ref name="Ka-52_prod">[http://www.kamov.ru/market/paghan/tka-52wr.html Kamov Ka-52 product page]</ref>

The fall of the Soviet Union prevented the Ka-52 from going into full scale production.  Currently only a handful of them exist. Twelve "Ka-52" are planned for purchase to 2015.<ref>[http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2006/08/07/110626 Article in Russian]</ref>

==Design==
===Weapons===
The aircraft carries a substantial load of weapons in four external hardpoints under the stub wings plus two on the wingtips, a total of some 2,300 kg depending on the mix. 

The main armament are the twelve Vikhr anti-tank missiles with a maximum range of some 10 km. The laser guidance is reported to be virtually jam-proof and the system features automatic guidance to target enabling evasive movement immediately after missile launch. The fire control system automatically shares all target information among the four Black Sharks of a typical flight in real time, allowing one helicopter to engage a target spotted by another, and the system also can input target information from ground-based forward scouts with man-portable target designation gear. The integrated 30mm cannon is semi-rigidly fixed on the helicopter's side, movable only slightly in elevation and azimuth. The aircraft's agility allows the weapon control system to turn (the entire helicopter and) the cannon at the target acquired in the pilot's helmet sight about as fast as the cannon turret of the Apache or the Mi-28 turns. The semi-rigid mounting improves the cannon's accuracy, giving the 30mm a longer practical range and better hit ratio at medium ranges than with a free-turning turret mount.

'''Ka-50チョールナヤ・アクーラ'''(カモフ50チョルナヤ・アクラ；鮫」という意味で、"Black Shark"という英訳名で紹介されることもある。一方、派生型'''Ka-50Sh'''(''''''<small>カー・ピヂスャート・シャー</small>)は非公式に'''ノチュノーイ・オホートニク'''(''''''<small>ナチュノーイ・アホートニク</small>)と呼ばれるが、これは「夜の狩人」という意味で、「Night hunter」という英訳名で紹介されることもある。NATOコードネームは'''ホーカム'''。 

== 概要 ==
ka-50は、ロシアMi-24シリーズの後継機として開発された。開発名称は'''V-80'''(''''''<small>ヴェー・ヴォースィミヂスャト</small>)であった。「V」()はロシア語でヘリコプターを意味する「vyertolyot」(<small>ヴィルタリョート</small>)の頭文字である。対抗馬であるMi-28が前任機Mi-24譲りの大型の機体であるのに対し、Ka-50はカモフが得意とする二重反転ローターを採用したコンパクトな機体として設計され、乗員も1名のみとされた。

ka-50は前任機をはるかに凌ぐ高度な機動力を有し、二重反転ローターによってもたらされる安定した飛行特性は他メーカーの攻撃ヘリコプターにはみられないものである。Ka-50は対空・対地両方への攻撃能力を有する機体として開発されたため、通常の攻撃ヘリコプター以上にSu-25T向けに開発された昼間テレビ自動追跡装置シュクヴァール(:「突風」の意味)を搭載した。また、自動追跡航法装置()ルビコーン()も搭載した。

1989年、V-80Sh-1(<small>ヴェー・ヴォースィミヂスャト・アヂーン</small>)はKa-50という新しい名称を獲得した。

また、ka-50は初めて射出座席を採用したヘリコプターとしても知られている。乗員が1名のみとするのも攻撃ヘリコプターとしては世界初の試みで、カモフではこれをセールスポイントとしていた。結果としてこれは複座機に慣れ親しんできた運用側に不安感を与えてしまい、Ka-50がビジネス的に失敗する要因となってしまった。そのため、トルコ空軍に売り込みをかけているKa-50-2はKa-50をタンデム複座型に改造した発展型となっている。

その後、カモフはKa-50を複座にしたKa-52を開発するとともに単座型Ka-50の改良型としてKa-50Shを開発した。同時期にはMi-28の夜間攻撃機型Mi-28Nも発されており、Ka-50シリーズでもKa-52やKa-50Shへ同様に夜間攻撃能力が付与された。シュクヴァール-V()の上部に装備されたサムシート-50T(:は「柘」の意味)システムは温度によって敵の画像を捉えるもので、索敵、追跡、レーザー誘導ミサイルによる攻撃に際し大きな力を発揮するものと期待された。カモフではKa-52とともにこのKa-50Shをロシア陸軍へ売り込んでおり、一度は決定されたとされたMi-28の採用が取り消しとなったことから再攻勢をかけた。結局は、Mi-28Nが50機の発注を受けている。なお、Mi-28Nの愛称もKa-50Sh同様ノチュノーイ・オホートニクである。

Ka-50はイメージ戦略として全身漆黒のカラーリングで公開され、その後もいくどかの変更を経ながら「映画スクリーン上の兵器」のような塗装は維持されてきた。それが大きく変更されたのはチェチェン戦争への実戦投入で、Ka-50は実戦仕様の迷彩を施され、8機が前線へ投入された。これはKa-50の実戦試験であった。
