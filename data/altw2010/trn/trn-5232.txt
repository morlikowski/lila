'''GayFest''' is the annual lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights organisation. The festival also receives funding from the Romanian Ministry of Health and the National Council for Combating Discrimination, as well as a number of private organisations, such as the Open Society Institute and the British Council in Romania.

GayFest features various LGBT cultural events, such as film screenings, art exhibitions, theatre and parties, as well as seminars and debates concerning LGBT social issues; since 2005 the festival has also included a gay pride parade. 

==Background==
The Romanian gay rights movement began gaining ground in the mid-1990s, after homosexual sex between two consenting adults in private was decriminalised in 1996. In the same year, Romania's first gay rights organisation, ACCEPT, was founded in Bucharest, with two core aims: creating a better society for LGBT people in Romania, and changing negative social attitudes towards LGBT people.<ref name="about-accept">[http://accept-romania.ro/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=25&Itemid=40 About ACCEPT], ACCEPT</ref> In the late 1990s, the LGBT rights movement was mainly concerned with lobbying for the repeal of Article 200, which continued to criminalise public displays and promotion of homosexuality. In this context, the issue of organising a gay pride festival was not viable, particularly considering that public manifestations of homosexuality could have been prosecuted under Section 5 of Article 200, which read:

 [http://accept.ong.ro/200rom.html Articolul 200], ACCEPT</ref>}}

It is important to note, however, that in October 2000, while Article 200 was still in force, ACCEPT hosted the 22nd European Conference of the International Lesbian and Gay Association in Bucharest. The event attracted around 100 participants from 27 countries, and created substantial dialogue and media attention about LGBT rights in Romania.<ref>[http://accept.ong.ro/Conference2000.html The Annual ILGA-Europe Conference takes place in Bucharest], ACCEPT, 8 October 2000</ref>

After pressure from ACCEPT as well as the European Union and the Council of Europe, Article 200 was repealed completely at the end of 2001, removing the last anti-gay law in Romania. Additionally, anti-discrimination legislation introduced in 2000 made it illegal to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation. This permitted a greater social visibility of LGBT people and culture, with several gay clubs opening from 2002 onwards. In this context, the organisation of a gay pride festival became much more viable, with ACCEPT seeking to use these festivals in order to further enhance the visibility of LGBT people, and, particularly through an emphasis on cultural events, further its aim of changing negative social attitudes toward LGBT people in Romania.

==GayFest 2004==

The GayFest 2004 was, at that time, the first LGBT festival ever organised in Romania, and took place between 3 and 9 May. It was initially titled "The Diversity Festival", and had the theme of "You have the right to be diverse". The festival was mainly centred on public debates concerning attitudes towards LGBT people in Romania, as well as cultural events. Several publications on LGBT issues, such as George Bălan's ''Homofobia'', were officially launched, and Romania's first LGBT film festival was organised, with nine films from nine different countries, including a documentary about the 2001 gay pride parade in  year = 2005| url =http://www.accept-romania.ro/fest/fest04EN.htm| title =Programme, Diversity Festival 2004| publisher =[[ACCEPT| language =Romanian| accessdate =2006-08-28

According to Florin Buhuceanu, the executive director of ACCEPT:

The festival was publicly supported by a number of high-profile figures, such as parliamentarian  year = 2005| url =http://www.accept-romania.ro/fest/fest04RO1.htm| title =Press review from the Diversity Festival 2004| publisher =[[ACCEPT| language =Romanian| accessdate =2006-06-04

The 2004 Diversity Festival was initially planned to be organised with the support of the Romanian Government, the British Council, the Goethe Institute, and the Embassy of Sweden in Bucharest.<ref name="2004-press" />

A gay pride parade through central Bucharest was also initially projected, but was later abandoned, with various newspapers stating that Romanian society was not ready for such an event. Ştefan Iancu, the organiser of the 2004 Diversity Festival, stated to ''Ziarul'', on 3 May, 2004, that, "We wanted to do this [a pride parade], but we don't know if we would succeed in convincing gay people to come out into the streets. Evidently, they are too afraid of the repercussions (jobs lost, shocked parents, etc.)"<ref name="2004-press" /> Nonetheless, the next year a gay pride parade was organised as part of GayFest 2005.

==GayFest 2005==
thumb|right|175px|GayFest Parade 2005
The 2005 GayFest took place between 23 and 30 May, under the slogan of "You have the right to love". It sparked a significant amount of controversy in Romania, as it included the first gay pride parade in the country. Initially, the application for this parade, which took place on May 29, was rejected by the Bucharest City Hall, on the grounds that the city could not adequately provide security for the participants. Various right-wing groups, such as the neo-fascist Noua Dreaptă, as well as the Romanian Orthodox Church, also actively opposed the march and called for its ban. 

The parade received authorisation, however, after intense lobbying from international gay rights campaigners and the National Council for Combating Discrimination, as well as public support from President Traian Băsescu and Justice Minister Monica Macovei.<ref>{{cite web| year = 2005| url =http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/05/052605romania.htm| title =Romania's President Steps In To Save Gay Pride Fest| publisher =365gay.com| language =English| accessdate =2006-06-04

}}</ref> though some sources claim that as many as 850 participants were present.<ref name="hotnews-2005"></ref> A counter-demonstration, which had not received approval from the City Hall, was organised by Noua Dreaptă, the participants of which displayed anti-gay banners and violently aimed to break up the pride parade. Several members of Noua Dreaptă were arrested, and the group was subsequently fined 3,000 lei (approximately US$1,000).<ref name="hotnews-2005" /> At the conclusion of the parade, the executive director of ACCEPT, Florin Buhuceanu, stated that:

Aside from the pride parade, an LGBT film festival was organised during the GayFest week, with 13 films being shown at three different venues: the Goethe Institute, ''La Motoare'', and the Elvira Popescu Cinema. Two public debates and seminars were organised at La Scena, on the topics of homosexuality and religion, the mass media, and anti-discrimination laws.<ref> </ref>

==GayFest 2006==

The 2006 GayFest took place between Same-sex marriage and civil unions in Romania"; neither is currently recognised in the country. During the GayFest week, ACCEPT called on the state to legalise same-sex marriage, or at least civil unions, creating unprecedented media coverage and debate about this issue.

Alongside members of the LGBT community, the march was also attended by several supporters of civil rights and human rights, many of them heterosexual. One woman who participated in the parade stated to BBC News that:

}}</ref>}}

Like last year's event, however, the 2006 parade was not without opposition. On May 30, twenty-two conservative NGOs, including the far right-wing Noua Dreaptă, called on the Romanian Orthodox Church to oppose the pride parade. On June 2, the Orthodox Church denounced the City Hall for permitting the march to take place, stating that it is "an affront to the morality of public institutions, and a danger ... for the formation of young people".<ref></ref> Additionally, Noua Dreaptă filed a legal complaint in a Bucharest court to get the march banned, arguing that it was "obscene and anti-social".<ref>[http://english.pravda.ru/news/world/01-06-2006/81400-Romania-0 Romania: Christian group protests against gay march], Pravda, 1 June 2006</ref> The complaint was not, however, successful, with the court declaring that the GayFest Parade should take place.<ref name="mediafax" />

Following the parade, the organisers, ACCEPT, stated that despite the attempts by anti-gay protesters to break up the parade, they were pleased that the authorities had the situation under control, and that the number of participants in the parade was greater than expected.<ref name="libertatea-5jun"/> The two parties of the governing Liberals and the Democrats — issued a statement after the parade condemning the violent anti-gay protests and calling for tolerance. They did not, however, comment on the issue of same-sex unions. The opposition Social Democratic Party also condemned the anti-gay violence.<ref></ref>

A few days after the pride parade, the ''Conservatives and Greater Romania Party were opposed to same-sex marriage.<ref> [http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=5585&art=13570&cHash=ce26621f04 Familia Florin şi Raul nu primeşte credit cu buletinul], ''Cotidianul'', 6 June 2006</ref>

The 2007 GayFest was held between 4 and 9 June, 2007, with the theme of "Celebrate diversity! Respect rights!"<ref>[http://www.accept-romania.ro/fest/indexEN.htm GayFest 2007], ACCEPT</ref> The festival included a pride parade, art exhibitions and a film festival, as well as two public debates (one on discrimination and another on religion and democracy).

În săptămâna de GayFest, ACCEPT a cerut statului să legalizeze căsătoria între persoane de acelaşi sex, sau măcar uniunile civile, această declaraţie creeând discuţie şi dezbatere fără precedent în mass media şi în societate în general.

Totuşi, ca şi parada gay din anul precedent, marşul din 2006 nu a fost fără opoziţie. Pe 30 mai, 22 de ONG-uri conservatoare, inclusiv Noua Dreaptă, a lansat un comuicat care cerea ca Biserica Ortodoxă Română să se opună paradei. Pe 2 iunie, BOR a criticat primăria pentru că a permis organizarea paradei şi a declarat că această paradă este un "afront la moralitatea instituţiilor publice şi un pericol... pentru formarea celor tineri."<ref> [http://www.edgenewyork.com/index.php?ci=120&ch=news&sc=glbt&sc2=news&sc3=&id=12614 Ring-wing Christian group calls on Romanian authorities to ban gay march] (''Grup creştin de dreapta cere autorităţilor române să interzică marşul gay''), AP/Edge News, 1 iunie 2006</ref> În plus, Noua Dreaptă a depus o plângere Curţii de Apel din Bucureşti despre decizia primăriei de permite parada, declarând că marşul ar fi "obscen şi anti-social".<ref>[http://english.pravda.ru/news/world/01-06-2006/81400-Romania-0 Romania: Christian group protests against gay march] (''România: Grup creştin protestează în portriva marşului gay], Pravda, 1 iunie 2006</ref> Plângerea nu a fost de succes, curtea declarând că parada GayFest poate să aibă loc.<ref name="mediafax" />

La 11:00 în 3 iunie, cu câteva ore înainte de parada GayFest, Noua Dreaptă a organizat o contra-demonstraţie, cu o participare de aproximativ 150 de persoane,<ref>[http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol_54193/ziua_panaramelor___dreapta___homo.html Ziua panaramelor - Dreapta & Homo], ''Jurnalul Naţional'', 3 iunie 2006</ref> pentru "valori de familie" şi "tradiţii morale".

Totuşi, zeci de persoane au încercat violent să întrerupă parada gay, ciocnindu-se cu o prezenţă foarte puternică a Jandarmeriei, care a apărat activiştii LGBT. Manifestanţii anti-gay au mărşăluit cu semne pe care scria "România nu vă vrea" şi au aruncat cu ouă în poliţişti şi în participanţii paradei gay. 51 de manifestanţi anti-gay au fost arestaţi şi amendaţi de poliţie pentru că au provocat violenţă.<ref> [http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=L0393312 [Romanian anti-gay protesters clash with police] (''Manifestanţi anti-gay români se ciocnesc cu poliţia''), Reuters, 3 iunie 2006</ref>

După parada, Alianţei Dreptate şi Adevăr, liberalii şi democraţii, au condamnat protestele violente anti-gay şi au cerut toleranţă. Nu au comentat, totuşi, despre uniunile între persoane de acelaşi sex. Deasemenea, Partidul Social Democrat, în opoziţie, a condamnat violenţa anti-gay.<ref>[http://www.evz.ro/article.php?artid=261190 A început dezbaterea gay], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', 5 iunie 2006</ref>
