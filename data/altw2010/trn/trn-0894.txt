== 생애 ==
발렌스는 발렌티니아누스 1세의 동생으로 초기의 생애에 대하여는 별로 알려진 것이없다. 발렌스는 아리우스파 였고 용모가 괴상망측해서 안짱다리에 올챙이배이고 눈은 심한 사시였다고 한다. <ref>존 줄리어스 노리치, 남경태 역 《비잔티움 연대기:제1권 창건과 혼란》 바다출판사, 2007. 162쪽 </ref>젊어서부터 군대에서 두각을 나타낸 형과는 달리 발렌스는 가문의 영지를 지키면서 보냈는데 형이 율리아누스 황제 휘하에서 페르시아 제국으로 원정을 떠날때 처음으로 군문에 입문하여 함께 따라나섰다. 율리아누스가 전사하고 뒤를 이은 요비아누스 황제도 잠시후 364년 2월 요비아누스의 부하로 요직에 있던 발렌티니아누스 1가 황제에 정해졌다. 발렌티니아누스는 자신 혼자 대제국을 다스리는 것이 어렵다고 판단하고 364년 3월 28일 동생인 발렌스를 제국의 동부를 담당하는 황제로 임명하였다.

발렌스는 선임황제 요비아누스가 콘스탄티누스 가문과 관련이 있다고 주장하며 군단의 지지를 얻어내고 트라키아와 비티니아도 포로코피우스의 편으로 돌아섰다.

발렌스는 소아시아에서 형 발렌티니아누스에게 도움을 요청했으나 당시 형도 알레마니족의 위협으로 동방까지 도와줄 여력이 없었다. 발렌스가 프로코치우스를 상대하기 위하여 안티오크에서 진격하자, 프로코피우스 세력은 배분이 일어나 군대는 대부분 달아났고 결국 프로코피우스 자신도 부하의 배신으로 붙잡혀 처형당했다. 반란은 진압되었지만 발렌스는 반란파를 혹독하게 보복했고 잔인하게 고문하고 처형하였기에 백성들에게서 공포와 두려움의 대상이 되고 인기를 잃었다.

발렌스는 프로코피우스의 반란이 마무리 되자 고트족과 전쟁을 시작했는데 고트족은 반란자 프로코피우스를 지원했을 뿐만 아니라 트라키아를 침략하겠다고 위협하고 있었다. 367년 발렌스는 도나우 강을 건너 고트족의 영토를 침공하고 많은 요새를 건설하고 고트족을 무력화시켰다.

371년 발렌스는 동방으로 눈을 돌려 사산조 페르시아와의 전쟁을 준비하였다. 당시 사산조 페르시아의 샤푸르 2세는 아르메니아 왕국의 아르사케스왕을 잡아들이고 자사로 내몬 뒤 아르메니아를 페르시아의 위성국가로 만들었다. 발렌스는 샤푸르의 공격을 잘 막아내었고 다시한번 강화조약을맺었다.

375년 발렌티니아누스가 죽자 제국의 서방은 발렌티니아누스의 두 아들, 그라티아누스와 발렌티니아누스 2세에게로 분할되어 상속되었다. 또한 사산조 페르시아와의 긴장이 고조되어 다시한번 발렌스가 동방원정을 계획하는 가운데 이사우리아와 팔레스타인에서 반란이 일어났다. 비록 발렌스는 이를 성공적으로 제압했지만 사산조와의 전면전을 수행 할 수는 없었다.

당시 제국의 골치거리는 훈족의 침입이었다. 훈족은 동고트족과 서고트족을 압박해왔고 376년 동고트족의 에르마나리크왕은 훈족에 맞서 싸우다가 죽었다. 서고트족의 족장 아타나리크는 훈족에 쫓겨 발렌스에게 트라키아로 이주해 달라고 청원하였고 발렌스는 이를 수락하였다. 그러나 트라키아의 총독인 루피키누스는 황제의 명령을 거절하고 서고트족을 탄압하였고 이에 반기를 든 서고트족과의 전투에서 패했다. 서고트족과 모든 트라키아의 고트족, 여기에 훈족까지 가세하여 로마를 압박하자 로마는 전면전에 돌입했다.

'''Flavius Iulius Valens''' (Last True Roman'', was defeated and killed in the Battle of Adrianople, which marked the beginning of the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
==Life==
=== Appointment to emperor ===
Valens and his brother Flavius Valentinianus (Valentinian) were both born 48 miles west of Julian.

In February Hebdomon.

Valens obtained the eastern half of the Balkan Peninsula, Syria and Anatolia as far east as Persia. Valens was back in his capital of Constantinople by December 364.

=== Revolt of Procopius ===

Valens inherited the eastern portion of an empire that had recently retreated from most of its holdings in Armenia because of a treaty that his predecessor Jovian had made with Procopius. Procopius had been charged with overseeing a northern division of Julian's army during the Persian expedition and had not been present with the imperial elections when Julian's successor was named. Though Jovian made accommodations to appease this potential claimant, Procopius fell increasingly under suspicion in the first year of Valens' reign.

After narrowly escaping arrest, he went into hiding and reemerged at Constantinople where he was able to convince two military units passing through the capital to proclaim him emperor on 28 September, 365. Though his early reception in the city seems to have been lukewarm, Procopius won favor quickly by using propaganda to his advantage: he sealed off the city to outside reports and began spreading rumors that Valentinian had died; he began minting coinage flaunting his connections to the Constantinian dynasty; and he further exploited dynastic claims by using the widow and daughter of Constantius II to act as showpieces for his regime. This program met with some success, particularly among soldiers loyal to the Constantinians and eastern intellectuals who had already begun to feel persecuted by the Valentinians. 

Valens, meanwhile, faltered. When news arrived that Procopius had revolted, Valens considered Syria when he learned of the revolt. Even so, Valens sent two legions to march on Procopius, who easily persuaded them to desert to him. Later that year, Valens himself was nearly captured in a scramble near Chalcedon. Troubles were exacerbated by the refusal of Valentinian to do any more than protect his own territory from encroachment. The failure of imperial resistance in 365 allowed Procopius to gain control of the dioceses of Thrace and Asiana by year's end. 

Only in the spring of 366 had Valens assembled enough troops to deal with Procopius effectively. Marching out from Ancyra through Pessinus, Valens proceeded into Phrygia where he defeated Procopius's general Gomoarius at the Battle of Thyatira. He then met Procopius himself at Nacoleia and convinced his troops to desert him. Procopius was executed on May 27 and his head sent to Valentinian in Trier for inspection.

=== War against the Goths ===
The Gothic people in the northern region had supported Procopius in his revolt against Valens, and Valens had learned the Goths were planning an uprising of their own. These Goths, more specifically the Tervingi, were at the time under the leadership of Noviodunum, and attacked the north-easterly Gothic tribe of Greuthungi before facing Athanaric's Tervingi and defeating them. Athanaric pled for treaty terms and Valens gladly obliged. The treaty seems to have largely cut off relations between Goths and Romans, including free trade and the exchange of troops for tribute. Valens would feel this loss of military manpower in the following years.

=== Conflict with the Sassanids ===

Among Valens' reasons for contracting a hasty and not entirely favorable peace in 369 was the deteriorating state of affairs in the East. Jovian had surrendered Rome's much disputed claim to control over Armenia in 363, and Shapur II was eager to make good on this new opportunity. The Sassanid ruler began enticing Armenian lords over to his camp and eventually forced the defection of the Arsacid Armenian king, Arsakes II, whom he quickly arrested and incarcerated. Shapur then sent an invasion force to seize Pap, in the fortress of Artogerassa, probably in 367. By the following spring, Pap had engineered his escape from the fortress and flight to Valens, whom he seems to have met at Marcianople while campaigning against the Goths. 

Already in the summer following his Gothic settlement, Valens sent his general Arinthaeus to re-impose Pap on the Armenian throne. This provoked Shapur himself to invade and lay waste to Armenia. Pap, however, once again escaped and was restored a second time under escort of a much larger force in 370. The following spring, larger forces were sent under Terentius to regain Iberia and to garrison Armenia near Mount Npat. When Shapur counterattacked into Armenia in 371, his forces were bested by Valens' generals Traianus and Vadomarius at Bagavan. Valens had overstepped the 363 treaty and then successfully defended his transgression. A truce settled after the 371 victory held as a quasi-peace for the next five years while Shapur was forced to deal with a Kushan invasion on his eastern frontier. 

Meanwhile, troubles broke out with the boy-king Pap, who began acting in high-handed fashion, even executing the Armenian Narses and demanding control of a number of Roman cities, including Edessa. Pressed by his generals and fearing that Pap would defect to the Persians, Valens made an unsuccessful attempt to capture the prince and later had him executed inside Armenia. In his stead, Valens imposed another Arsacid, Varazdat, who ruled under the regency of the sparapet Musel Mamikonean, a friend of Rome.

None of this sat well with the Persians, who began agitating again for compliance with the 363 treaty. As the eastern frontier heated up in 375, Valens began preparations for a major expedition. Meanwhile, trouble was brewing elsewhere. In Queen Mavia had broken into revolt and devastated a swath of territory stretching from Sinai. Though Valens successfully brought both uprisings under control, the opportunities for action on the eastern frontier were limited by these skirmishes closer to home.

=== Gothic War ===

Valens' plans for an eastern campaign were never realized. A transfer of troops to the western empire in 374 had left gaps in Valens' mobile forces. In preparation for an eastern war, Valens initiated an ambitious recruitment program designed to fill those gaps. It was thus not unwelcome news when Valens learned that the Gothic tribes had been displaced from their homeland by an invasion of Huns in 375 and were seeking asylum from him. In 376, the Visigoths advanced to the far shores of the lower Danube and sent an ambassador to Valens who had set up his capitol in Antioch. The Goths requested shelter and land in the Balkan peninsula. An estimated 200,000 Goths were along the Danube in Moesia and the ancient land of Dacia. 

As Valens' advisers were quick to point out, these Goths could supply troops who would at once swell Valens' ranks and decrease his dependence on provincial troop levies — thereby increasing revenues from the recruitment tax. Among the Goths seeking asylum was a group led by the chieftain Fritigern. Fritigern had enjoyed contact with Valens in the 370s when Valens supported him in a struggle against Athanaric stemming from Athanaric's persecution of Gothic Christians. Though a number of Gothic groups apparently requested entry, Valens granted admission only to Fritigern and his followers. This did not, however, prevent others from following.

When Fritigern and his Goths undertook the crossing, Valens's mobile forces were tied down in the east, on the Persian frontier and in Isauria. This meant that only ''riparian'' units were present to oversee the Goths' settlement. The small number of imperial troops present prevented the Romans from stopping a Danube crossing by a group of Goths and later by Huns and Alans. What started out as a controlled resettlement mushroomed into a massive influx. And the situation grew worse. When the riparian commanders began abusing the Visigoths under their charge, they revolted in early 377 and defeated the Roman units in Thrace outside of Marcianople.

After joining forces with the Ostrogoths and eventually the Huns and Alans, the combined barbarian group marched widely before facing an advance force of imperial soldiers sent from both east and west. In a battle at ''Ad Salices'', the Goths were once again victorious, winning free run of Thrace south of the Haemus. By 378, Valens himself was able to march west from his eastern base in Antioch. He withdrew all but a skeletal force — some of them Goths — from the east and moved west, reaching Constantinople by May 30, 378. Meanwhile, Valens' councilors, Comes Richomeres, and his generals Frigerid, Sebastian, and Victor cautioned Valens and tried to persuade him to wait for Gratian's arrival with his victorious legionaries from Gaul, something that Gratian himself strenuously advocated. What happened next is an example of hubris, the impact of which was to be felt for years to come. Valens, jealous of his nephew Gratian's success, decided he wanted this victory for himself.
