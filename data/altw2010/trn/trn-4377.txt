"'''Hunted Down'''" is a song by the American EP (1987). The song was released as the band's first single in June 1987.

==Origin and recording==
The song features lyrics written by frontman Chris Cornell and music written by guitarist Kim Thayil. Thayil on the song:
<blockquote>That song wasn't supposed to be as heavy sounding as it turned out. We just started jamming on the riff and it took on the 'noise rock' dimensions, kind of a rhythmic thing. And that solo is a noise solo. It's very dissonant.<ref name="gilbert">Gilbert, Jeff. [http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/articles/gschool_5-94.shtml "Primecuts: Kim Thayil"]. ''Guitar School''. May 1994.</ref></blockquote>

==Composition==
The song is representative of the early "grunge" sound - with its dirty guitar, dissonant atmosphere and lyrics concerning entrapment and escape.

==Release and reception==
It was the only single released from ''Screaming Life''. The single was pressed on blue vinyl as a limited edition with only 500 copies made, and has since become a Soundgarden collector's item. "Nothing to Say" was the B-side of the single. Oddly, this B-side, rather than "Hunted Down", later appeared on the Soundgarden compilation ''A-Sides''.

"Hunted Down" was the first song on Sub Pop's "hold music" tape. According to guitarist Kim Thayil, "You would call them up, and when they put you on hold you heard 'Hunted Down'."<ref name="gilbert"/> Upon hearing the song, record labels began contacting the band, which eventually led to the band signing with A&M Records.
