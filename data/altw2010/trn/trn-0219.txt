'''''Ghost World''''' is a 2001 film by Terry Zwigoff, based on a graphic novel by Daniel Clowes, also titled ''Ghost World''. It stars Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi. Although the film was not a box-office blockbuster, it was enormously acclaimed by critics and has established a strong cult following. 

The story focuses on the life of two teenage friends, Enid (Los Angeles, where much of the movie was shot.

== Plot ==  
The film begins with Enid, the main character, dressed in her graduation gown dancing to an Indian dance video in her bedroom. It then cuts to shots of a graduating class, and a girl in a wheelchair making a speech. Enid and Rebecca (best friends and outcasts among their class mates) find the speech ironically humorous, noting that the girl went from being considered troublesome to being considered saintly by virtue of a car accident. Then the class throws off their graduation hats, and Enid and Rebecca wander off in the distance and give the finger to the school they've managed to survive. After checking her diploma, Enid is angered to discover that it was awarded only conditionally and that she must attend a remedial art class that summer.

Later, Enid and Rebecca attend the graduation party, where they are annoyed by various students they don’t like, including Melora, an overly enthusiastic would-be actress, who pops in and out of the narrative.  In the background, the valedictorian can be seen drinking liquor from a flask.  

The next day, while in a restaurant (a mediocre imitation of a 1950s-style 33 1/3 RPM blues record from him. He wraps it in his own plastic bag, which delights her. 

Enid also begins to attend her art class, which is taught by Roberta Allsworth, an arty, self important performance artist.  She dismisses Enid's talented drawings as cartoons, preferring the conceptual artwork of another student because it is "serious" and "political."  Enid becomes more depressed and withdrawn.  Rebecca, on the other hand, finds a job in a trendy coffee shop and seems more and more content to lead an ordinary life.

Despite her growing alienation, Enid finds some solace in her growing friendship with Seymour, becoming increasingly infatuated with him as her relationship with Rebecca fades. She learns more details about Seymour's life, including his middle management position with a fast food franchise called Cook's Chicken.  Seymour informs Enid of Cook's secret racist past (it was originally called "Coon Chicken" also known as Coon Chicken Inn) after Enid discovers an old poster from Cook's depicting a grotesquely caricatured black man. Seymour unwisely lets Enid have the poster (he stole it from work).  Enid brings the poster to her art class, presenting it as a found art object.  Her classmates are appalled, but Roberta is impressed with the concept behind Enid's project and later offers her a scholarship to an art college.

As much as Enid grows to like Seymour, she is not entirely honest with him. First, she sets out to arrange dates for him and eventually encourages him to develop a relationship with Dana, the woman he originally became infatuated with. However, Enid becomes jealous when Dana works to end Enid's friendship with Seymour out of her own jealousy.  After Seymour turns down Enid's invitation to her art class' end of term show, Enid is too upset to attend the show alone and skips it, unaware that her contribution, the racist found art object, has created a scandal that makes the papers (and costs Enid her scholarship and Seymour his job).  Later Enid, intentionally or not, sabotages Seymour's relationship with Dana by having a drunken one-night stand with him. Seymour, whose feelings towards Dana have been fading anyway, now hopes to have a serious romantic relationship with Enid.  Enid, on the other hand, flees Seymour's apartment the next morning before he awakens and refuses to take his calls.

In the meantime, Enid and Rebecca get in a heated fight, and the two, who originally wanted to rent an apartment together, reconsider; Rebecca thinks she would be better off living on her own, but Enid, after discovering that she has lost the scholarship and that her father's former girlfriend is moving back, insists that she still wants to live with Becky. On the night before she is to move in with Becky she is unable to finish packing, and she does not show up at Becky's the next day.  Seymour turns up though, frustrated because Enid has been ignoring his calls (and that he has lost his job because of her). Becky, angered herself by Enid's not showing, spitefully tells him about the telephone prank she and Enid played on him earlier.  Seymour turns up at Josh's workplace, a convenience store, to take out his anger and humiliation on Josh, but a customer intervenes and injures Seymour, putting him in the hospital.  Enid visits him and lets him know that she has in fact come to like and respect him a great deal, showing him the art portfolio she made with Seymour being prominently featured in it. Enid and Rebecca also have a reconciliation of sorts, half-heartedly speaking of “calling each other” sometime.  As time passes, Seymour has a therapy session with a bored psychiatrist to work out his issues.  Enid, who is still trying to figure out what to do with her life, boards a bus—once thought to be on a defunct line—and the bus drives off into the distance.

== Cast ==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: frame|right|155px|Enid (Thora Birch) donning a catwoman mask in ''Ghost World'' -->
*Thora Birch as Enid, an alienated teenage girl—intelligent, witty, artistic, cynical, sarcastic. A keen observer of the world around her, she has been compared to Holden Caulfield.
*Scarlett Johansson as Rebecca, Enid's best friend since childhood, also alienated though slightly less so.
*Steve Buscemi as Seymour, Enid’s partner in loneliness.  A record collector, only Seymour can understand Enid’s trouble with individualizing herself while, at the same time, trying to find some happiness because he has had the same problem all of his life.
*Brad Renfro as Josh, the unhappy convenience store clerk, whom Enid and Rebecca enjoy tormenting.  Low key and mature, he often disapproves of the two girls' pranks but is usually cajoled into going along with them.
*Illeana Douglas as Roberta Allsworth, Enid's art teacher.  Affected and pretentious, she nevertheless comes to Enid's defense when Enid is attacked for her politically incorrect found art project. 
*Bob Balaban as Enid's kind but ineffectual father.
*Stacey Travis as Dana, Seymour's love interest.  She is attractive and likable, but her conventional tastes bore Seymour and he eventually dumps her.
*Teri Garr as Maxine, the girlfriend of Enid's father.  Enid dislikes her, as she does most adults.
*Dave Sheridan as Doug, an eccentric loiterer who frequently clashes with Josh's boss at the convenience store.
*Tom McGowan as Joe, a housemate and garage-sale partner of Seymour's.
*David Cross as Gerrold, the Pushy Guy
*Brian George as the irritable Greek owner of the convenience store where Josh works
*Debra Azar as Melora, an aspiring actress who graduated with Enid and Rebecca
*Rini Bell as the self righteous, handicapped graduation speaker
*Buzzington additionally appears in Art School Confidential, another film directed by Terry Zwigoff also based on a short story by Daniel Clowes.
*Ashley Peldon as Margaret, another student in Enid's art class, the teacher's pet.

==Differences from the comic==
The film departs from its source material in a number of ways.

*Enid and Rebecca's surnames, Coleslaw and Doppelmeyer, are omitted.
*The character of Seymour is entirely absent from the novel, and the sequence involving the prank call and the personal ads involves an unnamed older man who bears little resemblance to Seymour, and is only seen for a few panels.
*The summer art school scenes are not in the comic, and are based on another Clowes comic, Art School Confidential (but mostly original with the film).
*The comic featured a story in which Enid is applying to a prestigious college, which causes a rift to form between her and Becky.  This subplot is absent from the film.
*The tall magazine store employee who sells videotapes to Enid early in the film is actually an amalgam of two characters from the comics, John Ellis and Johnny Apeshit.
*The character of Bob Skeets, an astrologer and psychic, is dropped from the film entirely.  The satanists are also given more focus in the comic.
*In the comic Becky lives with her grandmother, a character who does not appear in the film.
*The comic does not feature the subplot involving Enid and Becky trying to find an apartment.

== Reception ==
''Ghost World'' premiered on June 16, 2001 at the Seattle International Film Festival, to lower than average recognition by audiences, but admiration from critics. It was also screened at the several film festivals all over the world including the Fantasia Festival in Montreal.

With a limited commercial theatrical run in the US, ''Ghost World''’s commercial success was extremely minimal—grossing less money than used to make the film, and from small attention from audiences and box office recipients – however its critical reception was far greater than a certain degree of films released that year, sitting at a lofty eminent position on many critical lists, significantly praised in many reviews. The overall box office tally for ''Ghost World'' in 2001 was US$6,944,894, on its estimated $7,000,000 budget.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162346/business Box office/business for Ghost World]</ref><ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ghost_world/ Rotten Tomatoes]</ref>

Film critic Roger Ebert of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' said "I wanted to hug the film [''Ghost World'']. It takes such a risky journey and never goes wrong. It creates specific, original, believable, lovable characters, and meanders with them through their inconsolable days, never losing its sense of humor. The Buscemi role is one he's been pointing toward during his entire career; it's like the flip side of his alcoholic barfly in ''Trees Lounge,'' (1996) who also becomes entangled with a younger girl, not so fortunately." He also listed on his "Top Ten of 2001" list.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/click/movie-1109008/reviews.php?critic=columns&sortby=default&page=1&rid=242342 Ghost World BY ROGER EBERT]</ref> Its 92/100 rating of fresh reviews on Rotten Tomatoes reflected its commercial success, marked by being one of the most-rented films from March 2002–December 2002, sitting at number 7 on its first release into video stores.

The film had its DVD release to retailers in the US on February 5, 2002, and was one of the most popular sales in the DVD sales chart of 2002.
