'''White South Africans''' is a term which refers to people from British or other linguistic, cultural and historical terms, they are generally divided into the English speakers who share an Anglophone background.

==Background==
===Demographics===
Statistics South Africa estimates that there are about 4.4 million Whites in South Africa (2007)&mdash;down from an all-time high of 5 068 300 in the 1991 census. It is likely that the group was undercounted in the 2001 census, as many live in private gated neighbourhoods in cities, and on isolated farms which did not receive census forms. The undercount may be as much as 10%, which would bring the white population to about 4.8 million. Roughly 60% of white South Africans speak English. 1% of the white population speak other European languages as their mother tongue, such as German, Portuguese or Greek. Speakers of Afrikaans refer to themselves as Occidental countries over the past two decades, mainly to Britain, United States.

===Distribution===
According to Statistics South Africa, white Africans make up about 9.2% (July 2006) of the total population in left|thumb|Romanticised painting of an account of the arrival of [[Jan van Riebeeck, founder of Cape Town.]]

==Politics==
White Africans continue to participate in politics, having a presence across the whole political spectrum from left to right. In general, white Africans consider themselves to be just as African as the non-white majority in South Africa. President Thabo Mbeki stated in one his speeches to the nation that: "''South Africa belongs to everyone who lives in it. Black and White.''" The history of white Africans in South Africa dates back to the 17th century. 

There has been some rivalry and bitter feeling between Afrikaners and English-speaking white Africans.  This is due in part to the Second Boer War, Britain's attempt to anglicise the country during the first half of the 20th century, and Afrikaner nationalism. 

Prior to 1994, the white Africans minority of South Africa held complete political power under a system of racial segregation called apartheid. Many white Africans supported this policy, but some others opposed; support for an anti-apartheid South Africa amongst white South Afrikans was very small, only about 15-20% of whites opposed apartheid.  .

During apartheid, immigrants from Taiwan, South Korea and Japan were considered ''honorary whites'' in the country, as the government had and maintained diplomatic relations with these countries. These were granted the same privileges as white Africans. African-Americans were sometimes granted an 'honorary white' status as well, based on the government's belief that they were "civilised" and possessed western values.

==Current trends==
In recent decades there has been a steady proportional decline in the white African population, due to higher birthrates among the non-white population of South Africa. More recently, the improved counting of the majority black African population, the undercounting of white Africans in the census figures and emigration have contributed to a sharp decline since 1994. In 1994, upon the abolition of apartheid, white Africans comprised 13.6% of the population, compared to 9.2% today. According to some previous census data, the highest proportion of whites in South Africa was around 1911, when they made up between 19-21% of the population. It is estimated that at least one million white Africans have moved abroad.

In contrast, the white African populations of East Rand, Johannesburg and Pretoria grew between 1996 and 2001. East Rand's white population expanded by 31,567 or 7%, with Pretoria's white population also increasing by 0,7% with 3,295 more white residents. In Johannesburg the white population increased by 22,982, or 4.6%.
  
Like many other communities strongly affiliated with the colonial legacy in Africa, the white Africans are often economically better off than their black African neighbors, but have nonetheless surrendered political dominance to majority rule.  There were also many white Africans in South Africa who lived in poverty--especially during the 1930s. Current estimates of white poverty in South Africa run as high as 12%.

'''Blanke Zuid-Afrikanen''' (Britse kolonisten. Daarnaast zijn er ook nog in de loop der eeuwen immigranten uit verschillende Europese landen naar Zuid-Afrika geëmigreerd. Er wordt in Australië en Argentinië omdat zij het niet eens zijn met het nieuwe Zuid-Afrika.

==De blanken in Zuid-Afrika==
De blanken zijn in Zuid-Afrika terecht gekomen toen de Kaap een Nederlandse en later Britse kolonie werd. Vanaf de Grote Trek zijn zij zich ook in de koloniën verder in Zuid-Afrika zoals de Transvaal, de Oranje Vrijstaat en de Natal gaan verstigen. Nu wonen zij net zoals zwarte Zuid-Afrikanen en Kleurlingen door heel Zuid-Afrika. Veel blanken wonen echter op het platteland van de Kaapprovincie. 

===In de steden===
In Durban 8,9%.

In veel dorpen en plaatsen vooral in de West- en Oostkaap zijn er geheel of bijna geheel blanke plaatsjes. Een dorpje met 100% Afrikaners is bijvoorbeeld Orania.

==Afrikaners (nazaten van Nederlanders)==
Boeren(vooral vroeger)) zijn voormalig Nederlandse kolonisten en grotendeels van Nederlandse afkomst. Omdat er bij de VOC ook met name Duitsers en Hugenoten (protestante vluchtelingen uit Frankrijk) in dienst waren, hebben veel Afrikaners Franse of Duitsgetinte achternamen.
