'''Del tha Funkee Homosapien''' is an Oakland, California <ref name="AMG"></ref>.  He currently lives in Richmond, California. 

==Biography==
Cousin of renowned rapper Ice Cube, Del began his career writing lyrics for Cube's backing band, Da Lench Mob.<ref name="Hiero"></ref> In 1991, with the help of Ice Cube, Del released his first solo album, ''I Wish My Brother George Was Here'',<ref name="Hiero"/> at the age of 19. The album was a commercial success, largely due to the popularity of the hit single, "Mistadobalina". Ultimately Del, who was not pleased with the limited musical range of the album, took matters into his own hands, and severed his production-artist relationship with Ice Cube for his next album, ''No Need for Alarm''. 

''No Need for Alarm'' also saw the introduction of the famous Oakland clique Hieroglyphics,<ref name="Hiero"/> whose original members included the widely acclaimed Oakland sound of hip hop, as well as the freestyle based, "golden era-97" style of hip hop being expanded at the time. Rather than the use of multiple funk samples, including those of Pfunk, ''No Need for Alarm'' features a bold, classic hip hop sound, often referred to as an updated Oakland version of Boom Bap, which is a certain archetypal hip hop sound, and because Del and his crew represents Oakland.  The sound of this album was largely due to the production work of Domino, a producer for the Hieroglyphics crew. The album ''No Need for Alarm'' is still considered one of the greatest albums ever to come out of Del, Hieroglyphics, or Oakland, and is highly regarded as one of the all time classic albums of hip hop. The instrumental pressings of this record is considered the "holy grail" of hiphop instrumental albums, due to the quality of production on the album and also due to its extremely limited pressing.  

Due to touring, mundane activities, and frequent Elektra, stating that his contract had been terminated.<ref name="Hiero"/>

Del's third solo album ''Hieroglyphics Imperium label. Del also released another collaborative work with the Hieroglyphics crew in 1998, ''Deltron 3030'' which was a collaborative work with artists Dan “the Automator” Nakamura and Kid Koala, featuring a special guest appearance by Scotty "the Great Gatsby" Beezle. Exposure from the 3030 project helped to expand Del's fan base&mdash;the 3030 project worked well as a marketing move because the CD capitalized on the growing interest of computer technology, incorporating motifs of science fiction, telling stories about life and hip hop based in the year 3030, and infusing much of the popular internet terminology and culture in circulation at the time.

Del collaborated with pop-group Clint Eastwood" and "Russel Hobbs' backstory, the character of Del was one of Russel's friends that was gunned down in a drive-by shooting, whose ghost possessed Russel.  When Del was not invited to work on the exorcised in 2003.

2003 also saw the release of ''Full Circle'', the second full-length album from the Hieroglyphics crew.

In 2004 Elektra released ''The Best of Del The Funky Homosapien: The Elektra Years'' without the approval of Del. The CD only includes songs from his first two albums, along with a handful of b-sides from that era. Del was not pleased and advised people to not buy the CD, saying it was just Elektra trying to make money off of him due to his newfound fame.

Together with his crew, Del has established his own independent record label, Hieroglyphics Imperium Recordings, which primarily consists of an expanded Hieroglyphics roster and a few other artists with whom the group collaborates regularly.

In 2000, the song "Catch All This" from ''Casual, was featured in the game ''If You Must" was featured in the game ''Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3''. In 2003, the song "Positive Contact" from ''Deltron 3030'' was featured in the game ''Tony Hawk's Underground''. In 2005, the song "At the Helm" featuring Hieroglyphics was featured in the game ''Tony Hawk’s Project 8''. In 2006, the song "Catch A Bad One" was used in the game ''Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure''. Also in 2006 his song "Dr. Bombay" was used in the movie ''Beerfest'' and more recently a Hieroglyphics song "At the Helm" was featured in commercials for and is used in ''Tony Hawk's Project 8''. A Hieroglyphics song "Don't Hate the Player" was also featured in ''NBA 2K7''. Also, his song "Burnt" was featured in ''Tony Hawk's American Wasteland''.

Del has also had many songs featured in snowboarding movies. "Press Rewind" was the song for Eero Ettala's part in the film ''White Balance'' and "If You Must" was featured in ''DC Mountain Lab''.

Currently there is a DVD available called ''11th Hour'', which DVD contains some live footage, footage of him in the studio and around the house, as well as footage of him recording ''11th Hour''. It was his first solo album in more than seven years.

In 2008, ''11th Hour'' was released first, with the new Deltron album, ''Deltron Event II'' to be released afterwards. 

"11th Hour" was released by Definitive Jux instead of the usual Hiero Imperium. CEO and MC El-P all but confirmed Del's signing recently in a cryptic myspace blog post.
