《'''无颜之月'''》是2000年12月22日由OrbitROOT发行的一款成人游戏，是其公司的處女作。主要讲述了女主角仓木玲菜和她的未婚夫，男主角羽山浩一在与世隔绝的仓木家发生的故事。后来被改编为成人动画OVA，由Pink Pineapple发售。动画原定四集，但是因为发售以后颇受好评，所以延长成了五集。完成以后，以第一集到第四集的性爱场面为中心组合成了总集篇。《桃華月憚》可以看作是它的续作。

==登场人物==
动画版的游戏版的声优都未公开。

'''羽山浩一'''

男主人公，在北条大学的本山教授的研究室学习的大学生。虽然是美青年，不过不能认识女性的脸（看到女性的脸也意识不到那是女性的脸）。在本山教授的推荐下，来到小时后曾经呆过的信州的仓木的山。到了那里以后，突然发现他是仓木铃菜的未婚夫。是个烟瘾很重的人，并且精力旺盛。

'''仓木铃菜'''

女主角。生于1982年。是仓木家上一任主人仓木善治郎和妻子由利子的女儿，仓木神社的巫女。阴气很强。虽然是浩一的未婚妻，不过对这强加的关系有些困惑。同时有些任性，对怎样寄信和饭店的存在都不知道，可以说是温室中的花朵。因为以前没有遇到过像浩一那样说话直率的人，所以对他抱有反感。不过渐渐为浩一所吸引，作为女性的自我认知开始苏醒。

'''春川知美'''

仓木家的主治医生春川一平的养女，也是仓木家的一名女佣。做人很圆滑，因此颇受主人浩一的信赖。同时脸型很可爱，身材也很好（特别是胸部），是个美女。除了作为女佣完成自己的工作，对浩一的性的需求也是不分时间和场所的加以满足。

'''栗原沙也加'''

仓木家的女佣。性格开朗，对浩一以朋友而不是主人的态度相处。和铃菜和知美相比稍微瘦一些。据本山教授所说，她和以前很有人气而突然失踪的女优山都琉璃长得很像。

'''东衣绪'''
