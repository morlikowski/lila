The '''Plan de Sánchez massacre''' took place in the department, on Achi Maya) were abused and murdered by members of the armed forces and their paramilitary allies. 

The killings took place during one of the most violent phases of Guatemala's Civil War, which pitted various groups of left-wing insurgents against the government and the armed forces. After assuming power in March 1982, President massacre in Plan de Sánchez was an element in the government's guerrilla groups. 

After the massacre, the village was practically abandoned for a number of years and the survivors were told that reprisals would follow if they spoke about the incident or revealed the location of the numerous amnesties to the suspected perpetrators, the survivors saw that Guatemala's domestic legal remedies were ineffective in this case and consequently decided to lodge a complaint with the Organisation of American States, in 1996.

The IACHR began processing the complaint, received a partial recognition of the state's institutional responsibility from democratically elected president Alfonso Portillo in the first year of his term, and finally referred the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights for judgement and settlement. In 2004, the Inter-American Court issued two judgements, in which it established Guatemala's liability in the case and ordered an extensive package of monetary, non-monetary and symbolic forms of compensation for the survivors and the next-of-kin of the deceased.

==National context==
:''See also: History of Guatemala, Guatemalan Civil War.''
1982 was one of the bloodiest years in Guatemala's 36-year-long history of internal conflict (1960–1996).

On disputed election two weeks earlier. The coup leaders asked retired Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt to negotiate the departure of both Lucas and Guevara. 

Ríos Montt, who had been the candidate of the Christian Democracy Party in the 1974 presidential election and was widely regarded as having been denied his own victory through fraud, accepted the appointment. 
He formed a three-member military junta that annulled the 1965 constitution, dissolved Congress, and suspended all political parties. After a few months, he dismissed his junta colleagues and assumed the ''de facto'' title of President of the Republic; in his inaugural address, Ríos Montt – a lay pastor in the evangelical Protestant Church of the Word – stated that his presidency resulted from the will of God.<ref>

The country's guerrilla forces and their leftist allies denounced Ríos Montt, who sought to defeat the guerrilla insurgency with a combination of military action and economic reforms; in his words, "beans and rifles" ''(frijoles y fusiles)''. 
An army officer was quoted in the ''indigenous people in El Quiché, that: "If you are with us, we'll feed you; if not, we'll kill you."<ref>
"Guatemala Enlists Religion in Battle", Raymond Bonner, ''New York Times,'' 18 July 1982. For a number of years, the U.S. State Department, in its background notes on Guatemala, attributed this quotation to Gen. Ríos Montt himself. See: [http://web.archive.org/web/20020404034633/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2045.htm Background Note: Guatemala; April 2001 version,] via the Internet Archive.</ref> 

The government began to form local "civilian self-defence patrols" (the paramilitary forces known as  ''patrullas de autodefensa civil'' or PACs). Participation was in theory voluntary, but in practice, many ''campesinos,'' especially in the north-west, had no choice but to join either the PACs or the guerrillas. The country's conscript army, supported by the PACs, recaptured practically all the guerrilla-held territory – guerrilla activity lessened and was largely limited to hit-and-run operations. However, this partial victory was won at an enormous cost in civilian deaths.

Ríos Montt's brief presidency was probably the most violent period of the 36-year internal conflict, which resulted in about 200,000 deaths of mostly unarmed, mostly indigenous civilians.<ref>

Although leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads also engaged in summary executions, forced disappearances, and torture of non-combatants, the vast majority of human rights violations were carried out by the military and the PACs they controlled. The internal conflict is described in great detail in the report of the Historical Clarification Commission ''(Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico,'' or CEH), which estimates that government forces and their paramilitary confederates were responsible for 93% of the violations.<ref>

On 8 August 1983, Ríos Montt was deposed by his own Minister of Defence, Gen. Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores, who succeeded him as ''de facto'' president of Guatemala.

==The events of July 1982==
Since early 1982, the inhabitants of the area had been facing increasing pressure from the 
authorities.  Many of the local men had refused to participate in the self-defence patrols and, as a result, the military kept a strong presence in the area. Many men fled their homes for the mountains, leaving the womenfolk and children behind.  Others had already, prior to the massacre, filed formal complaints – reporting the armed forces' constant threatening behaviour and harassment – with the justice of the peace in Rabinal, but these allegations were never investigated; on the contrary, the men who lodged the complaints were fined.

In early July 1982, a military aircraft flew over the village and dropped a number of bombs on areas close to several homes. On 15 July, an army detachment set up camp in the village and began house-to-house inspections, asking after the menfolk and threatening the villagers.  

Sunday, 18 July, was market-day in Rabinal. The pathways and roads of the municipality were, from an early hour, crowded with people from local villages and farms taking their goods to market. The village of Plan de Sánchez was one of several settlements criss-crossed by the network of routes leading to the municipal seat. 

At around 08:00 that Sunday morning, soldiers at the military detachment fired two 105-mm mortar shells at the village. One of these landed to the east of the main group of houses; the other, to the west. Later that same day, between 14:00 and 15:00, a military detachment arrived in Plan de Sánchez. 
This force of some 60 men – comprising regular army (led by a captain and a lieutenant), PAC patrolmen, police, and civilians dressed in military fatigues and armed with assault rifles – 
took up stations at the village's points of entry and exit, heading off people from other settlements returning from market. Others went from house to house, gathering the inhabitants together. At this point, some of the men succeeded in fleeing the round-up and took to the surrounding woods and hills.

The younger women were sent to one house, with the men, children, and older women directed to another. A group of around twenty of the younger women (aged between 12 and 20) were separated from the main group and taken to another building; there, they were humiliated, accused of supporting the guerrillas, beaten, and raped.  A handful of these women managed to escape and take refuge in the surrounding countryside, while the remainder were killed.

The children were separated from the main group and beaten and kicked to death. Then, at around 
17:00, the soldiers threw two hand grenades into the house where the adults were being held and began spraying the walls with automatic gunfire. Residents of nearby villages and those from Plan de Sánchez who were observing the massacre from vantage points in the surrounding hills report that intense gunfire continued until about 20:00, when the army set fire to the buildings. The armed forces finally left the village at around 23:00.

The next morning, some of those who had fled returned to the smoking ruins of their village. None of the bodies in the houses could be identified; many of the others who had fallen in the yards adjacent to the houses had bullet holes in their heads, chests, and backs, but identification of these victims was made difficult because many of the charred corpses had already been partially devoured by dogs and other animals.

At around 15:00 on that Monday, two military commissioners and a squad of PAC patrolmen arrived in Plan de Sánchez and ordered the survivors to dig graves and bury the victims' remains, threatening them that the village would be bombarded by the air force if they failed to comply. More than 20 clandestine communal graves were dug and filled.  Meanwhile, the patrolmen ransacked the houses that had not been burned down, stealing personal property and livestock and destroying identification papers. 

===Witness testimony===
:"They separated the children, and the girls of 15 to 20 years old. Then they began the massacre. First, they tortured the elderly, because they said the latter were guerrillas; then they threw two grenades and fired weapons… After executing the women, the men and the elderly, they took the children one by one, smashed them against the ground, and threw them into the flames. No one could escape because the Army had surrounded the entrance and exit of Plan de Sánchez, as well as the adjacent roads… [The next day] he braced himself to leave the place where he was hiding to go and examine the havoc that had been wrought. Together with his brothers, Juan, Buenaventura and Esteban, and with Eulalio Grave Ramírez, he put out the fire that was still consuming the corpses."

:"They separated the girls who were 15 to 20 years old from this group, and took them to Guillerma Grave Manuel's house; they raped them; they broke their arms and legs, and then they killed them… The children were smashed against the floor, and then thrown into the flames together with their parents… At 8 p.m., he was able to enter his own home and saw that his wife and three of his children were dead. He found one of his daughters alive; she had managed to escape, because she was buried under the bodies of her two siblings."

:"My sister went shopping in Rabinal but when she got to the hamlet of Plan de Sánchez the army was already there. There they grabbed her and raped her in a house. There were fifteen girls raped and then they were riddled with bullets.  Afterward, they were buried by the people, in a clandestine cemetery."

:"The witness heard her mother, who was walking through the village, scream and saw when they seized her nine-month old nephew from her mother, with its shawl and everything, and took them to the house where all the people were gathered… At the time of the massacre, she was 13 or 14 years old. She lost her mother, sister, grandmother, aunts and all her cousins, even the babies… The following day, she was able to see the corpses, but only for a short time, because the soldiers granted three hours to bury her next of kin."

Le '''massacre de Plan de Sánchez''' eut lieu dans le village Guatemaltèque de Plan de Sánchez, département du Baja Verapaz, le Achi Maya) furent maltraités et assassinés par des membres des forces armées et leurs alliés paramilitaires.

Les assassinats eurent lieu au cours d'une des plus violente période de la Guerre Civile Guatemaltèque, qui opposa divers groupes d'gauche au gouvernement et à ses forces armées. Après être arrivé au pouvoir, par un coup d'état en Mars 1982, le général terre brulée du gouvernement, le village fut visé car les autorités soupçonnaient ses habitants d'abriter sinon de soutenir des groupes de guérilla.

Après le massacre, le village fut pratiquement abandonné pendant de nombreuses années et on menaça les survivants de représailles s’ils révélaient l'incident ou les endroits ou ils avaient aidé à creuser les nombreuses fosses communes. Avec le retour progressif à la démocratie qui commença à la fin des années 1980 et au début des années 1990, quelques-uns des survivants sentirent qu'ils pouvaient commencer à parler des assassinats sans crainte pour leures vies. Des plaintes furent déposées auprès des autorités en Commission Inter-Américaine des Droits de l'Homme (IACHR), dépendante de l'Organisation des États américains.

L'IACHR commença à instruire la plainte et en Alfonso Portillo, président démocratiquement élu du Guatemala, reconnu la responsabilité limité des institutions de l'état dans les faits, l'affaire fut finalement renvoyé devant la Cour Inter-Américaine des Droits de l'Homme pour jugement et règlement. En 2004, la court Inter-Américaine prononça deux verdicts, établissant la responsabilité du Guatemala et ordonnant un ensemble de compensations monétaire, non-monétaire et symbolique pour les survivants et les ayant-droits des personnes décédés.
