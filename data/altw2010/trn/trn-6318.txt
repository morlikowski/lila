'''Krynn''' is the fictional world of the Dragonlance setting.

==Creation==

Chaos, father of the Gods, spread his influence amongst them and caused the gods to go to war. Paladine created the elves, Takhisis created the Ogres, and Gilean created the humans.  Paladine, the head god of good, gave the souls physical bodies.  Gilean, head god of neutrality, gave the gift of free will to while Takhisis cursed the races with mortality. Reorx shared his knowledge of metal forging with humans; however they did not honour him for sharing their new skill.  Reorx cursed these humans by making them as short as him, and stripped them of their skill but leaving their desire to invent, which created Gnomes. The Graygem, which contained Chaos himself, fell to Krynn due to the gnomes meddling. A wizard named Gargath found the Graygem and took it to his castle. The gnomes followed him there and went to war for the gem. During the battle the wild magic of Chaos warped the Gnomes into the other races of Krynn. That is how the Kender, Dwarves, Minotaurs, etc came to be.

==Krynn's Sky==
There are three moons on the planet of Krynn, and each is the face of one of the gods of magic.  They chose not to put themselves in stars or planets, but to be as close to Krynn as possible so as to watch it.  Wizards of High Sorcery draw power from these moons and their respective gods.  The moons are the white moon Solinari, representing the god of good magic, the red moon Lunitari, representing the goddess of neutral magic, and the black moon Nuitari, representing the god of evil magic.  Nuitari as a moon is little known; it can only be seen by those who use it for their magic.  Most people believe in only two moons, Solinari and Lunitari.

The other gods are represented in the sky by constellations. When the gods walk on earth their constellations disappear from the sky.

During the three decades between the Second Cataclysm and the War of Souls, the sky was different and there was also only one moon and no godly constellations, because Takhisis stole the world from the other gods and took it to a different part of the universe.

==Lands==
The most well known land mass of Krynn is Cataclysm shattered the continent, sinking the northeastern section of it and sending many chunks of Ansalon scattering as islands, including the once great Empire of Ergoth, which was not only separated from the mainland, but split into two.  North of Ansalon is the Dragon Isles, the home of the metallic dragons.  Far to the east is the island Ithin'carthia, homeland of the blue-skinned "brutes", or Tarmaks first introduced in Dragons of Summer Flame. To the north and east of Ansalon is Taladas, once the home of the very evil nation of Aurim, the "Anti-Istar". The Cataclysm melted the land where Aurim was, leaving a giant lake of molten rock. Far to the north and west of Ansalon is the mysterious Adlatum. The subterranean continent of Chorane lies deep under the surface of Icereach, and little is known about this underground land.

==History==
The majority of the history of Krynn is actually the history of Ansalon, as it is the most well-known continent.  The history of Krynn is measured in the following time periods: PC, or Prae Cataclius, meaning before the Cataclysm, AC, or Alt Cataclius, meaning after the Cataclysm, and SC, or Secundus Cataclius, the time period after the Chaos War.  It is also divided into five Ages, the Age of Starbirth, the Age of Dreams, the Age of Might, the Age of Despair, and the Age of Mortals.  The Age of Starbirth saw the creation of the world and the formation of the first races.  

The Age of Dreams contains the First Dragon War, fought by the elves under Silvanos Goldeneye against the evil dragons.  The elves prevailed against the evil dragons using magical stones that were lost after the war.  Kender, minotaurs, and dwarves begin to settle, however the dwarves disturb the magical stones and unleash the evil dragons again.  This begins the Second Dragon War, which is ended by the great power of several mages, however this power scars the land of Ansalon.  These mages learn the law of magic and form the Wizards of High Sorcery and the Towers of High Sorcery.  After this war, the Kinslayer War is fought, and Qualinesti is founded.  Later, the Rose Rebellion is led against the Empire of Ergoth and Solamnia is founded by Vinas Solamnus.  In addition, Istar is founded in this Age.  The Third Dragon War erupts, leading to the great sacrifice by Huma Dragonbane to keep Takhisis away from the world.

== Krynnin kansat ==

*Ihmiset
Ihmiset ovat kaikista kansoista neutraalein. He ovat mieleltään ailahtelevia 
ja heitä tapaa sekä pahojen, Nerekan ritareiden riveistä, että hyvien, Solamnian ritareiden.
*Haltiat
Haltiat rakastavat kaikkea hyvää ja ovat hyvin luonnonläheisiä(vaikkakin poikkeuksia löytyy).
Haltioille tunnusomaisia merkkejä ovat: Ihmisiin verrattuna hyvin kauniita, mantelin muotoiset silmät,
suipot korvat ja he eivät pysty kasvattamaan partaa.
**Qualinestit
**Silvanestit
**Kagonestit(Kaganestit) (Villihaltiat)
**Merihaltiat
***Dargonestit
***Dimerinestit
*Kääpiöt
Lyhyet, mutta voimakkaat kääpiöt ovat taitavia käsistään. He hallitsevat metallinmuokkauksen sekä 
kivenveiston taidon. Tunnettuja pitkästä parrastaan. 
Partansa ajanut kääpiö tekee sen vain äärimmäisessä häpeässä
**Hilarit (Vuorikääpiöt)
**Neidarit (Mannunkääpiöt)
**Daergarit
**Vähäkääpiöt
*Kentit
Kenties Krynin vihatuin kansa heti vähäkääpiöiden jälkeen. Pienet, kimittävät ja alati "lainailevat" kentit
ovat kansan vihan alla, mutta tiedetään joidenkin mieltyneen näihin pikku olentoihin.
*Maahiset
Pienet maahiset puhuvat äärimmäisen nopeasti 
ja ovat taitavia rakentamaan mitä eriskummallisia vipstaakkeleja.
Niiden toimivuus taas ei ole taattua.
*Lohikäärmeet
Krynnin ensimmäinen ja kaikkein vanhin rotu.
