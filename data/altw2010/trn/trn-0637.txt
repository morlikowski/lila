'''荜澄茄'''（学名'''荜茇'''）''Piper longum L.''，又名'''尾胡椒'''，是香味。其味辛辣刺鼻，有些微苦味。

荜澄茄通过炼金术著作中。在约翰·帕金森的著作《''Theatrum Botanicum''》中，他提到香味剂；在印度尼西亚与非洲则被用作食物的佐料。

== 历史 ==
在公元前4世纪，西奥佛雷特斯提到了“''komakon''”，可将其与肉桂混合后作为芳香剂的成分。公元16世纪，吉勒梅·巴德与克劳狄斯·萨尔马修斯认为''komakon''就是荜澄茄，也许是因为爪哇语中的荜澄茄与“''kumukus''”的发音相似。这个误解造成了一个奇怪的事实——在西奥佛雷特斯之前，希腊人便与远在太平洋的爪哇人有了贸易联系。<ref name="Cordier, Yule_1"> Chapter XXV.</ref>没有迹象表明希腊人能从其它地方获得荜澄茄，因为爪哇的种植者们通过烤焦浆果使其绝育，并确保其不在其他地区种植，以维护他们的垄断权。<ref name="Katzer_1">.</ref>

在中国的唐朝时期，荜澄茄从苏门答腊的室里弗逊传入中国。在印度，这种香辛料被叫做“''kabab chini''”，意即“中国荜澄茄”，也许是因为中国人也是贸易中的一环，但更有可能是因为它是与中国的贸易中的一项重要商品。在中国，它被叫做“''vilenga''”或“''vidanga''”，起源于梵语中的名称。《海药本草》的作者李珣认为它与黑胡椒生长在同样的树上；唐代的医生认为荜澄茄能化食、祛邪、黑发、香体的作用。不过，没有迹象表明荜澄茄在中国被用作调味品。<ref name="Schafer_1"></ref>

成书于9世纪的《阿拉伯的菜肴中。<ref name="Hal_1"></ref>写于13世纪晚期的《马可波罗游记》中，将爪哇描述荜澄茄与其它一些高价物种的产地。14世纪，荜澄茄被鲁昂与利佩的商人以以胡椒的名义从谷物海岸运入欧洲。圣方济会的作者Francesc Eiximenis在一则14世纪的寓言故事中，描述了一名世俗的神职人员进食的习惯——在沐浴后吃掉用肉桂、荜澄茄与蛋黄混合的古怪食物，这可能被他作为春药。

在欧洲，荜澄茄亦被认为有祛邪的作用。在17世纪后期，一名天主教的牧师卢多维科·玛丽亚·Sinistrari记录了祛邪的方法，在其中荜澄茄是一种能挡住梦魇的熏香的成分。<ref name="Sinistrari_1">.

'''Cubeb''' (''Piper cubeba''), or '''tailed pepper''', is a plant in Piper'', cultivated for its Java and Sumatra, hence sometimes called '''Java pepper'''. The fruits are gathered before they are ripe, and carefully dried. Commercial cubebs consist of the dried berries, similar in appearance to black pepper, but with stalks attached &mdash; the "tails" in "tailed pepper".  The dried pericarp is wrinkled, its color ranges from grayish-brown to black. The seed is hard, white and oily. The odor of cubebs is described as agreeable and aromatic. The taste, pungent, acrid, slightly bitter and persistent.  It has been described as tasting like allspice, or like a cross between allspice and black pepper.

Cubeb came to Europe via Arabic '''' (), which is of unknown origin,<ref name="Katzer_1"></ref> by way of alchemical writings by its Arabic name. In his ''Theatrum Botanicum'', John Parkinson tells that the king of flavoring agent for gins and cigarettes in the West, and as a seasoning for food in Indonesia.

==History==
thumb|right|''Piper cubeba'', from ''[[Köhler's Medicinal Plants'' (1887)]]
In the 4th century BC, Javanese name of cubeb, ''kumukus''. This is seen as a curious evidence of Greek trade with Java in a time earlier than that of Theophrastus.<ref name="Cordier, Yule_1"> Chapter XXV.</ref> It is unlikely Greeks acquired them from somewhere else, since Javanese growers protected their monopoly of the trade by sterilizing the berries by scalding, ensuring that the vines were unable to be cultivated elsewhere.<ref name="Katzer_1">.</ref>

In the Tang Dynasty, cubeb was brought to China from Srivijaya. In India the spice came to be called ''kabab chini'', that is, "Chinese cubeb," possibly because the Chinese had a hand in its trade, but more likely because it was an important item in the trade with China. In China this pepper was called both ''vilenga'', and ''vidanga'', the cognate Sanskrit word.<ref name="Schafer_1"/> Li Hsun thought it grew on the same tree as black pepper. Tang physicians administered it to restore appetite, cure "demon vapors", darken the hair, and perfume the body. However, there is no evidence showing that cubeb was used as a condiment in China.<ref name="Schafer_1"></ref>

''Arabic cuisine around the 10th century.<ref name="Hal_1"></ref> ''morality tale exemplifying gluttony by the Franciscan writer Francesc Eiximenis describes the eating habits of a worldly cleric who consumes a bizarre concoction of egg yolks with cinnamon and cubeb after his baths, probably as an aphrodisiac. 

Cubeb was thought by the people of Europe to be repulsive to demons, just as it was by the people of China. Ludovico Maria Sinistrari, a Catholic priest who wrote about methods of incubus.<ref name="Sinistrari_1">. "...Incubus none the less persisted in appearing to her constantly, in the shape of an exceptionally handsome young man. At last, among other learned men, whose advice had been taken on the subject, was a very profound Theologian who, observing that the maiden was of a thoroughly phlegmatic temperament, surmised that that Incubus was an aqueous Demon (there are in fact, as is testified by Guazzo (''Compendium Maleficarum, I. 19''), igneous, aerial, phlegmatic, earthly, and subterranean demons who avoid the light of day), and so he prescribed a continual suffumigation in the room. A new vessel, made of earthenware and glass, was accordingly introduced, and filled with sweet calamus, cubeb seed, roots of both aristolochies, great and small cardamom, ginger, long-pepper, caryophylleae, cinnamon, cloves, mace, nutmegs, calamite storax, benzoin, aloes-wood and roots, one ounce of fragrant sandal, and three quarts of half brandy and water; the vessel was then set on hot ashes in order to force forth and upwards the fumigating vapour, and the cell was kept closed. As soon as the suffumigation was done, the Incubus came, but never dared enter the cell."</ref> Even today, his formula for the incense is quoted by neopagan authors, some of whom also claim that cubeb can be used in love sachets and spells.

After the prohibition of sale, culinary use of cubeb decreased dramatically in Europe, and only its medicinal application continued to the 19th century. In the early 20th century, cubeb was regularly shipped from Indonesia to Europe and the United States. The trade gradually diminished to an average of  annually, and practically ceased after 1940.<ref name="Weiss_1">.</ref>

==Chemistry==
The dried cubeb berries contain essential oil consisting monoterpenes (sabinene 50%, α-thujene, and carene) and sesquiterpenes (caryophyllene, copaene, α- and β-cubebene, δ-cadinene, germacrene), the oxides 1,4- and 1,8-cineole and the alcohol cubebol. 

About 15% of a volatile oil is obtained by distilling cubebs with water. '''Cubebene''', the liquid portion, has the formula C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>24</sub>. It is a pale green or blue-yellow viscous liquid with a warm woody, slightly camphoraceous odor.<ref name="Lawless_1"></ref> After rectification with water, or on keeping, this deposits rhombic crystals of camphor of cubebs. 

'''Cubebin''' (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is a crystalline substance existing in cubebs, discovered by drug, along with gum, fatty oils, and grains, and the dram.

thumb|right|277px|Dried cubeb berries
In India, Sanskrit texts included cubeb in various remedies. Charaka and Sushruta prescribed a cubeb paste as a mouthwash, and the use of dried cubebs internally for oral and dental diseases, loss of voice, halitosis, fevers, and cough. Unani physicians use a paste of the cubeb berries externally on male and female genitals to intensify sexual pleasure during coitus. Due to this attributed property, cubeb was called "''Habb-ul-Uruus''".<ref name="Khare_1"></ref> 

In Tibetan medicine, cubeb (''ka ko la'' in Tibetan) is one of ''bzang po drug'', six fine herbs beneficial to specific organs in the body, with cubeb assigned to the spleen.<ref name="Stearns_1"></ref> 

Arab physicians of the Middle Ages were usually versed in alchemy, and cubeb was used, under the name ''kababa'', when preparing the '''water of ''al butm'''''.<ref name="Patai_1">. "Take one pound of ''tarmantanita'', half a pound of honey of which the frost has been removed, one pound of ''aqua vita'', very fine Indian 'and, ''sandal'', in equal parts. Arab ''samg'', ''juz bawwa'', ''kholanjan'' root, '''''kababa''''', reed, ''mastaqi'', ''qaranfal'', ''sanbal'', of each three drachms. They must be pounded well and put into a distilling vessel made of glass, and it must be well covered, and put on a gentle fire. And the first water which will come up will be pure... (snip) And know that the first is called 'the mother of medicine'."</ref> ''The Book of One Thousand and One Nights'' mentions cubeb as a main ingredient in making an aphrodisiac remedy for infertility:

. mountain skink; and, pounding them all together, boiled them in sweet olive oil; after which he added three ounces of male frankincense in fragments and a cupful of coriander-seed; and, macerating the whole, made it into an electuary with Roumi bee honey." ''Skink'' refers to a kind of lizard.</ref>}}

The mixture, called "seed-thickener", is given to Shams-al-Din, a wealthy merchant who had no child, with the instruction that he must eat the paste two hours before having intercourse with his wife. According to the story, the merchant did get the child he desired after following these instructions. Other Arab authors wrote that cubeb rendered the breath fragrant, cured affections of the bladder, and that eating it "enhances the delight of coitus".<ref name="Adams_1"></ref> 

In 1654, Nicholas Culpeper wrote in the ''London Dispensatorie'' that cubebs were "hot and dry in the third degree... (snip) they cleanse the head of flegm and strenghthen the brain, they heat the stomach and provoke lust".<ref name="Culpeper_1"></ref> A later edition in 1826 informed the reader that "the Arabs call them ''Quabebe'', and ''Quabebe Chine'': they grow plentifully in Java, they stir up venery. (snip) ...and are very profitable for cold griefs of the womb".
