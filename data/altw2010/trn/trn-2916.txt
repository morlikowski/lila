==Biography==
Tim de Cler was born and grew up in Ajax showed interest in him and despite being a Feyenoord supporter he joined their arch rivals world famous youth system.<ref name="bio">[http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/s2/playerinfo.aspx?dataid=10010000030649 Tim de Cler spelers info], feyenoord.nl</ref> At Ajax he played at first as a left winger, but eventually he was positioned as a left back when he reached the A-level in youth football.<ref name="bio"/> He was offered his first professional contract and joined Ajax' second team. Once in a while he was added to the first team squad to train with the elite at the club.

On Willem II. Two days after his debut he played another match with the second team and he broke his John O'Brien and Maxwell. Still he managed to play a lot of matches. In his final year at the club he won both the Eredivisie and the KNVB Cup for the second and third time respectivaly.

De Cler decided to leave Ajax in the summer of 2002 and joined AZ, which in these days was a team that performed in the middle areas of the league table. In his first season at the club they finished in 10th position, but things changed when Sporting Lisbon. He was part of Argentina.

In his last year at AZ, during the 2006-07 season AZ could claim the Eredivisie championship at the last matchday as they were equal on points with both Ajax and PSV, but AZ had the far better goal difference and would have been the champions when all teams stayed equal on points. Where Ajax and PSV both won their final match of the season AZ lost theirs against Excelsior and finished in third position as a result. They also reached the final of the KNVB Cup, but were again denied the trophy as Ajax won the cup after a penalty shoot-out.

After five years at AZ he felt is was time for a change. Both PSV and Feyenoord showed interest. His players' manager Rob Jansen, who also works with Roy Makaay and Kevin Hofland made a unique effort to discuss the future of his players with them, each other and their future club Feyenoord to bring them all together at the club. Also Sigi Lens the manager of Giovanni van Bronckhorst was a part of the deal and when manager Bert van Marwijk signed his contract as the new Feyenoord manager all these players were contracted within a few weeks time span.<ref>[http://www.feyenoord-internet.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4816&Itemid=203 Het succes van Feyenoord], feyenoord-internet.nl</ref><ref name="bio"/>
