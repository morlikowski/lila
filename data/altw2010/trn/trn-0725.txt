'''Филадельфийский оркестр''' () — американский симфонический оркестр, базирующийся в Филадельфии. По сложившейся в американской музыкальной критике традиции относится к первой пятёрке симфонических оркестров США, так называемой «Большой Пятёрке». Его расцвет связан с многолетней работой двух выдающихся дирижёров — Леопольда Стоковского и Юджина Орманди, в сумме руководивших коллективом на протяжении 68 лет. Знаменательные страницы в истории оркестра — первая оркестровая электронная аудиозапись в 1925 г., первая среди оркестров США национальная телевизионная трансляция (1948, компания CBS), первые гастроли американского оркестра в коммунистическом Китае (1973), первая прямая трансляция крупного оркестра в Интернете (1997). В течение сезона (с сентября по май) Филадельфийский оркестр даёт около 130 концертов.

The '''Philadelphia Orchestra''' is an Big Five" American orchestras.  For the greater part of its history, the orchestra gave its concerts at the Academy of Music.  Since 2001, its subscription concerts have been performed at Academy of Music, although the orchestra returns to the Academy of Music for its annual gala concert.  The Philadelphia Orchestra also performs an annual series of concerts at Carnegie Hall.

==History==
===Leadership===
The orchestra was founded in conductor. In 1907 Karl Pohlig took over the post and served until 1912.  

In 1912 Leopold Stokowski became principal conductor, and brought the orchestra to national prominence. Under him, the orchestra gained a reputation for great virtuosity, and developed what is known as the "Philadelphia Sound."  Stokowski left the orchestra in 1941, and did not return as a guest conductor for nearly 20 years.

In 1936 Eugene Ormandy joined the organization, and jointly held the post of principal conductor with Stokowski until 1938 when he took over the role full-time. He remained with the orchestra for a total of 44 years, after which he became Conductor Laureate.  Ormandy conducted many of the orchestra's best-known recordings.  He took the orchestra on its historic 1973 tour of the People's Republic of China, where they were the first Western orchestra to visit that country in many decades.<ref></ref>  They were wildly popular in China, and have since returned for three more successful tours.

Riccardo Muti became principal guest conductor of the orchestra in the 1970s, and took over from Ormandy as Music Director in 1980, serving through 1992.  His recordings with the orchestra included the symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms, and Alexander Scriabin, for the EMI and Philips labels.

Wolfgang Sawallisch then succeeded Muti as Music Director from 1993 to 2003.  He made a number of recordings with the orchestra of music of  Robert Schumann, Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner, among other composers, for the EMI label.  However, the orchestra lost its recording contract with EMI during this time.  Toward the end of Sawallisch's tenure, the orchestra released a self-produced set of recordings of the Schumann symphonies with Sawallisch conducting.  In 2003, Sawallisch was named Conductor Laureate of the orchestra.  

In 2003, Christoph Eschenbach became music director.  This appointment was controversial because Eschenbach had not conducted the orchestra in over four years and there was a perceived lack of personal chemistry between him and the musicians prior to the appointment.<ref></ref> <ref>Peter Dobrin, "Orchestra has some lessons to consider".  ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 29 October 2006.</ref> <ref></ref>  At least one early report tried to downplay this concern.<ref>{{cite news

However, in October of 2006, Eschenbach and the orchestra announced that his tenure as music director would end in 2008, at which time he will have served five years, the shortest tenure as music director in the history of the Philadelphia Orchestra, along with Pohlig.

In February 2007, the orchestra named Charles Dutoit to the newly created posts of chief conductor and artistic adviser for four seasons, starting in the fall of 2008 and running through the 2011-2012 season.<ref>Tom Di Nardo, "Charles Dutoit to head orchestra".  ''Philadelphia Daily News'', 23 February 2007.</ref> <ref>Peter Dobrin, "Orchestra's interim pick: Dutoit".  <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I>, 23 February 2007.</ref>  This move was made to provide an "artistic bridge" while the orchestra searched for its eighth music director.<ref></ref> <ref>Peter Dobrin, "Which Dutoit will show up?"

Musicians from the orchestra were featured in a documentary film by Daniel Anker, ''Music from the Inside Out'', which received theatrical release and television airings.  The film has received both positive and negative criticism.<ref>{{cite news

===Firsts===
The Philadelphia Orchestra boasts an extraordinary record of media firsts. It was the first symphony orchestra to make electrical recordings (in 1925), the first to perform its own commercially sponsored radio broadcast (in 1929, on NBC), the first to perform on the soundtrack of a feature film  ''The Big Broadcast of 1937'', the first to appear on a national television broadcast (in 1948, on CBS), the first American orchestra to record the complete Beethoven symphonies on compact disc (in 1988), and the first major orchestra to give a live cybercast of a concert on the Internet (in 1997). On September 21, 2006 the Philadelphia Orchestra became the first major United States orchestra to sell downloads of their performances directly from the orchestra's website. While other American orchestras have downloads of their music on the internet, the Philadelphia Orchestra says it is the first to offer the downloads without a distributor.<ref>David Patrick Stearns, "Philadelphia Orchestra enters the ear-bud age".  ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', 21 September 2006.</ref> 

In other firsts, the Orchestra made diplomatic history in 1973 when it became the first American orchestra to tour the People's Republic of China, performing in Beijing's Great Hall of the People. In 1999, under Wolfgang Sawallisch, it became the first American orchestra to visit Vietnam.  More recently, the orchestra appointed Carol Jantsch principal tuba as of 2006-2007,<ref>Peter Dobrin, "Breaking the brass ceiling."Philadelphia Inquirer, 26 February 2006.</ref> and according to the announcement, it is possible that she is the first full-time female principal tuba player of an American orchestra.<ref>{{cite paper
