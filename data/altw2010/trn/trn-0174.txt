'''苏云金芽孢杆菌'''（专著中简称为Bt，旧称苏力菌）是革兰氏阳性的，芽孢杆菌属陆生习性的细菌。另外, 苏云金芽孢杆菌可寄生在一些蛾类和蝶类的幼虫上,甚至是植物表面。

苏云金芽孢杆菌由日本细菌学家石渡繁胤和德国科学家恩斯特·贝尔林纳（Ernst Berliner）分别在1901年和1911年独立发现。贝尔林纳是从患有叫做''Schlaffsucht''的疾病的地中海粉蛾幼虫中发现该菌，并用发现地德国圖林根（拉丁語Thuringia）命名。苏云金芽孢杆菌与蜡样芽胞杆菌和炭疽杆菌同属芽孢杆菌属，三种微生物的区别在于质粒的不同。与同属的其他成员一样，这三种杆菌需氧且可产生内孢子。

苏云金芽孢杆菌分泌出的由''cry''基因编码的，有杀虫活性的δ-毒素（或被称为杀虫晶体蛋白[ICP]）的蛋白结晶构成了内孢子。Cry蛋白对鳞翅目（如蛾与蝶）、双翅目（如苍蝇、蚊子）和鞘翅目（甲虫）有很大杀伤力。因此，可将苏云金芽孢杆菌发酵生产制成高效生物杀虫剂，或用''cry''基因制成防虫害的转基因产品。
== 害虫防治方面 ==

苏云金芽孢杆菌的'''伴孢晶体蛋白'''生产出的中国农科院与江苏省农科院合作，成功地将苏云金芽孢杆菌伴孢晶体蛋白基因导入大面积推广的棉花品种中，证明已获得转基因抗棉铃虫棉植株。

苏云金芽孢杆菌杀虫制剂常被用作液体'''喷射'''在作物上,药物必须被害虫食用才能发挥效用。溶液化的毒素在幼虫易受影响的'''中肠细胞膜'''上形成孔洞，导致害虫患败血病死亡。最新的研究表明, 苏云金芽孢杆菌必须在幼虫的中肠细菌存在下才能进行杀虫活动。

苏云金芽孢杆菌的以色列亚种广泛用于杀灭孑孓（蚊幼虫），该方法是蚊虫防治中的重要的环境友好方案。

=== 用途 ===

2000年，苏云金芽孢杆菌'''基因改造作物'''种植面积超过115,000 km²，占世界转基因作物耕种面积的19%，苏菌改造作物有可能取代33%的农药销售站，现在，每年有超过31,000 km²的苏菌改造作物取代传统的化学农药施用作物。

'''''Bacillus thuringiensis''''' is a butterflies, as well as on the dark surface of plants.<ref name=Brock></ref>

''B. thuringiensis'' was discovered 1901 in Japan by Ishiwata and 1911 in Germany by Ernst Berliner, who discovered a disease called ''Schlaffsucht'' in flour moth caterpillars. ''B. thuringiensis'' is closely related to ''B. cereus'', a soil bacterium, and ''B. anthracis'', the cause of anthrax: the three organisms differ mainly in their plasmids. Like other members of the genus, all three are aerobes capable of producing endospores.<ref name=Brock />

Upon sporulation, ''B. thuringiensis'' forms crystals of  genetically modified crops.

== Use in pest control ==

Spores and crystalline insecticidal Belgian company Plant Genetic Systems was the first company (in 1985) to develop genetically engineered (tobacco) plants with insect tolerance by expressing ''cry'' genes from ''B. thuringiensis''.<ref name=Hofte_1986> </ref><ref name=Vaeck></ref> 

''B. thurigiensis''-based insecticides are often applied as liquid sprays on crop plants, where the insecticide must be ingested to be effective. It is thought that the solubilized toxins form pores in the midgut epithelium of susceptible larvae. Recent research has suggested that the midgut bacteria of susceptible larvae are required for ''B. thuringiensis'' insecticidal activity.<ref name=Broderick_2006></ref>

''Bacillus thuringiensis'' serovar ''israelensis'', a strain of ''B. thuringiensis'' is widely used as a larvicide against mosquito larvae, where it is also considered an environmentally friendly method of mosquito control.

===Usage===
Bt crops (in corn and cotton) were planted on 281,500 km² in 2006 (165,600 km² of Bt corn and 115900 km² of Bt cotton).   This was equivalent to 11.1% and 33.6% respectively of global plantings of corn and cotton in 2006.<ref name = "klbbfu">[http://www.pgeconomics.co.uk/pdf/global_impactstudy_2006_v1_finalPGEconomics.pdf Microsoft Word - global_impactstudy_2006_v1_finalPGEconomics.doc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

This technology has delivered major economic and environmental benefits. In the first ten years of use (1996-2005), the farmers who used GM (Bt) insect resistant technology derived a total of nearly $9.9 billion worth of extra farm income, with the much of this benefit going to small, resource poor farmers in developing countries  (especially from the use of Bt cotton). Over this ten year period insecticide use on these two crops fell by 35.6 million kg of insecticide active ingredient which is roughly equal to the amount of pesticide applied to arable crops in the EU in one year. Using the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ)<ref>[http://www.nysipm.cornell.edu/publications/eiq/ A Method to Measure the Environmental Impact of Pesticides<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> measure of the impact of pesticide use on the environment, the adoption of Bt technology over this ten year period resulted in 24.3% and 4.6% reduction respectively in the environmental impact associated with insecticide use on the cotton and corn area using the technology.<ref name = "klbbfu"/>

===Advantages===
There are several advantages in expressing Bt toxins in transgenic Bt crops: 

:i) The level of toxin expression can be very high thus delivering sufficient dosage to the pest, 

:ii) The toxin expression is contained within the plant system and hence only those insects that feed on the crop perish (not true considering prolific pollen producers such as corn), 

:iii) The toxin expression can be modulated by using tissue-specific promoters, and 

:iv) replaces the use of synthetic pesticides in the environment. The latter observation has been well documented world-wide.<ref name = "klbbfu"/>
