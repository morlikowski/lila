'''National Lampoon''' ABD'de 1970-1998 yılları arasında yayınlanmış çok satan sıra dışı bir mizah dergisidir. Cambridge, Massachusetts'teki Harvard Üniversitesi'nin öğrencileri ve eski mezunları tarafından 1876 yılında oluşturulmuş bir mizah kulübü olan Harvard Lampoon'un (Lampoon kelimesi Türkçe'de taşlama, hiciv anlamına gelmektedir) bir yayın organı olarak Nisan 1970 tarihinde çıkmaya başlamış aylık mizah dergisidir. Temel dayanağı parodi olan dergide zekice kotarılmış yaratıcı çizgi romanlar ve iğneleyici karikatürlerin yanı sıra düz yazılar, sürrealist kolaj çalışmaları ve fotoğraflar da yer almaktaydı. Derginin sıradan insanları rahatsız edici absürd bir mizah anlayışı vardı, dolayısı ile de derginin kendine has bir hayran kitlesi oluşmuştu. Derginin absürd ve tabu yıkıcı mizah anlayışına tipik bir örnek her biri ayrı bir fenomen olan dergi kapaklarından birinden verilebilir. Amerika'lı gazete kodamanı William Randolph Hearst'e (d.1863- ö.1951) atfedilen (ki kendisi de Harvard Lampoon'un bir üyesi idi) "Bana üzerinde güzel bir kız, bebek veya köpek resmi bulunan bir dergi kapağı verin o derginin satışlarını zirveye çıkartırım" mealindeki sözü alınmış ve Ocak 1977 sayısının kapağına şöyle bir fotoğraf konmuş; Evin hanımı fırından henüz çıkarttığı tepsinin içinde duran kızartılmış ve garnitürlerle süslenmiş olan evin köpeğini bebeğine servis yapıyor. [http://www.fedge.net/nationallampoon/Lampoon1977.htm] Bu sıradışı mizah anlayışı olan dergi 1970'lerin sonunda popülaritesinin zirvesine ulaşmış ancak 1980'lere gelindiğinde tirajında bir düşüş başlamış nihayet 1998 yılında yayınına son verilmiştir. Önceleri aylık olarak çıkan dergi 1986 Kasım ayından itibaren 2 ayda bir yayınlanmaya başlamış,1992'den itibaren de gittikçe seyrekleşerek yılda bir sayıya kadar gerileyip Kasım 1998 sayısı ile birlikte yayınına son verilmiştir. Zirvede olduğu yıllarda tirajı 1 milyonun üzerine çıktığı aylar olmuş ama 800.000'in altına hiç inmemişti. 1970-1998 yılları arasında çıkan bu 246 standart sayı dışında ayrıca birçok özel albüm ve kitap da yayınlanmıştır. Basılı yayın dışında da plaklar, ses kasetleri, radyo programları, bir tiyatro gösterisi, TV gösterileri ve sinema-TV filmleri üretilmiştir.

'''''National Lampoon''''' was a ground-breaking American humor magazine which started in 1970 as an offshoot of the ''Harvard Lampoon''.  

Parody of every kind was a mainstay of the magazine, but sick humor, black humor and surrealist humor were also central to its appeal. Almost all the issues included long written humor pieces, shorter written pieces, "true facts", cartoons, and comic strips, and most issues also included "photo funnies" or fumetti.  

At its best, the humor was intelligent, imaginative, and cutting edge, and it often pushed far beyond the boundaries of what might be considered appropriate and acceptable. As co-founder Henry Beard described the experience years later: "There was this big door that said, 'Thou shalt not.' We touched it, and it fell off its hinges."

The magazine reached its height of popularity during the mid-to-late 1970s, but it had a disproportionately far-reaching effect on American humor. The magazine also directly spawned films, radio, live theatre, various kinds of recordings, and books.      

Many members of the creative staff from the magazine subsequently went on to perform in, or write for, or otherwise contribute creatively to successful films, television shows, books, and other media forms. 

The magazine declined during the late 1980s. It was kept barely alive for a number of years for brand name reasons, but it ceased publication altogether in 1998.

==The original humor magazine==
''National Lampoon'' magazine was started by Harvard graduates and ''Robert Hoffman in 1969, when they licensed the "Lampoon" name for a monthly national publication. The magazine's first issue was dated April, 1970.

After a shaky start for a few issues, the magazine very rapidly grew in popularity. It regularly skewered pop culture, the counterculture, and politics, with recklessness and gleeful bad taste.  Like the ''Harvard Lampoon'', individual issues were often devoted to a particular theme such as "The Future", "Back to School", "Death", "Self-Indulgence," or "Blight".  The magazine regularly reprinted material in "best-of" omnibus collections.

The magazine took aim at every kind of phoniness, and had no specific political stance, even though individual staff members had strong political views.

===Cover art===
''National Lampoon'' became infamous for its often acerbic and humorous magazine covers.  Some notable cover images include:
* Court-martialed Vietnam War murderer William Calley sporting the guileless grin of Alfred E. Neuman, complete with the parody catchphrase, 'What, My Lai?" (August 1971)<ref></ref> ;
* The iconic image of Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara being splattered with a cream pie (January 1972).<ref></ref> 
* A dog looking worriedly at a revolver pressed to its head, with the famous caption "If You Don't Buy This Magazine, We'll Kill This Dog" (January 1973).  In 2005, the American Society of Magazine Editors selected this magazine cover as the seventh-greatest of the last 40 years.<ref>[http://www.magazine.org/Press_Room/13806.cfm ASME Unveils Top 40 Magazine Covers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.magazine.org/Editorial/Top_40_Covers/ ASME's Top 40 Magazine Covers of the Last 40 Years<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref></ref>
