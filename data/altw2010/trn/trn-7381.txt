'''William Ellsworth "Dummy" Hoy''' (American center fielder in Major League Baseball who played for several teams from 1888 to 1902, most notably the Cincinnati Reds and two Washington, D.C. franchises. 

He is noted for being the most accomplished deaf player in major league history, and is credited by some sources with causing the establishment of signals for safe and out calls.<ref name="timeline1"> Sandy and Miller, p. 48.</ref> He held the major league record for games in center field (1,726) from 1899 to 1920, set records for career assists (7th; 273), and baserunner, scoring over 100 runs nine times, and often finishing among the top base stealers.  He is one of only 29 players to have played in four different major leagues.  His 1,004 career walks put him second in major league history behind Billy Hamilton when he retired, and he also ended his career ranking eighth in career games (1,796).

==Career==
Born in the small town of Houcktown, Columbus as class 1886 with an 1888, with the Washington Nationals of the American Association, Hoy became the third deaf player in the major leagues, after pitcher batting .274. At 5'4" and batting left-handed, he was able to gain numerous walks with a small strike zone, leading the league twice and compiling an excellent .386 career on base percentage.

His speed was a great advantage in the outfield, and he was able to play shallow as a result. On 1889 he set a major league record (which has since been tied twice) by throwing out three runners at home plate in one game, with catcher Connie Mack recording the outs. He and Mack joined the Buffalo Bisons of the St. Louis Browns under player-manager 1891, leading the league with 119 walks and scoring a career-high 136 runs (second in the league). He returned to Washington for two years with the Washington Nationals of the doubles each year and batting over .290 three times; in 1897 he led the NL with 359 putouts.

Before the 1898 season he was traded to the 1899 he broke Mike Griffin's major league record of 1459 games in center field. After playing for the last minor league season in 1900, where Comiskey was now the team owner, Hoy stayed with the team when the AL achieved major league status in 1901, helping them to the league's (and his) first pennant; that year he broke Tom Brown's record of 3623 career outfield putouts, and also led the league with 86 walks and 14 times 1902, batting .290 and breaking Brown's record of 4461 career total chances in the outfield, and played for Los Angeles in the New York Giants in the first faceoff between deaf players in the major leagues; Hoy got two hits.

Hoy retired with a .287 batting average, 2044 hits, 1426 runs, 726 runs batted in, 248 doubles, 121 triples and 40 Jimmy Ryan (then at 1829) in major league history. 1905, and Clarke topped his record for career total chances in 1909. His record for career games in center field was broken by 1920.

==Personal life==
In Hoy's time, the word "dumb" was used to describe someone who could not speak (as most deaf people at the time could not), rather than someone who was stupid; but since the ability to speak was often unfairly connected to one's intelligence, the epithets "dumb" and "dummy" became interchangeable with stupidity. Hoy himself often corrected individuals who addressed him as William, and referred to himself as Dummy. Said to have been able to speak with a voice that resembled a squeak, he was actually one of the most intelligent players of his time, and is sometimes credited with developing the hand signals used by umpires to this day, though this view is widely disputed; Cy Rigler is believed to have created signals for balls and strikes while working in the minor leagues, and Bill Klem is credited with introducing those signals to the major leagues. Indeed, no articles printed during Hoy's lifetime have been found to support the suggestion that he influenced the creation of signals, nor did he ever maintain that he had such a role. In addition, if Hoy could read the lips of an umpire only a few feet away, it is unlikely that he would have needed a manual signal as well. Nonetheless, due to the possibility that he may have played a role in the use of signals, as well as for his all-around play, there is a movement to support his election to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.<ref name="timeline3-03-2000">Sandy and Miller, p. 49.</ref>

'''William Ellsworth "Dummy" Hoy''' (američki igrač bejzbola koji je na položaju center fieldera nastupao u Major League Baseballu od 1888. do 1902. godine. 

Poznat je kao najuspješniji gluhi igrač u historiji MLB, a neki izvori mu pripisuju signale za dosuđivanje ''safea'' i ''outa''. Bio je izvrstan trkač na bazama, postigavši preko 100 runova u sezoni devet puta.  Nalazi se među samo 29 igrača koji su igrali u četiri velike MLB lige.  Njegovih 1004 walkova u karijeri je drugi po redu rekordu historiji MLB, iza Billy Hamiltona.

Rodio se u gradiću Houcktown u  Ohiju, gdje je u dobi od tri godine oglušio od Columbus kao najbolji učenik svoje generacije. Nakon završetja školovanja je otvorio postolarsku radnju u rodnom gradu te igrao bejzbol preko vikenda. Prvi profesionalni ugovor je potpisao 1886. za klub iz grada Oshkosh u 1888. pridružio se Washington Nationalsima u American Associationu, postavši treći gluhi igrač MLB, iza pitchera Eda Dundona i catchera Toma Lyncha. U prvoj sezoni je vodio ligu u ukradenim bazama (iako je ta statistika bila drukčije definiraan 1898), a imao je i 69 walkova.

Jedna od njegovih prednosti je bila brzina. Dana 1889. postavio je rekord MLB (kasnije izjednačen dva puta) kada je u jednoj utakmici izbacio tri runnera, uz pomoć catchera Connieja Macka. On i Mack su se 1890. priključili ''Buffalo Bisonsima'' u St. Louis Brownse pod igračem-menadžerom Charlesom Comiskeyem te igrao u posljednjoj sezoni lige 1891, gdje je postigao 119 walkova i 136 runova. Vratio se u Washington i igrao za ''Washington Nationals'' u National Leagueu, koji su ga u decembru 1893. godine prodali Redsima, gdje se ponovno našao u društvu Comiskeya. Hoy je u tom klubu proveo sljedeće četiri godine.

Prije sezone 1898. je prodan u Honusom Wagnerom, Fredom Clarkeom i Tommyjem Leachem (koji je bio njegov cimer). Nakon toga je otišao u ''niža liga godine 1900, s Comiskeyem kao vlasnikom. Hoy je ostao s tim klubom za vrijeme prve sezone AL kao major lige 1901, te po prvi put osvojio prvenstvo. Svoju karijeru je završio s ''Redsima'' godine 1902. a zatim je igrao za Los Angeles u Dummyja Taylora iz New York Giantsa što je bio prvi okršaj dvojice gluhih igrača u historiji MLB; Hoy je tada zabilježio dva hita.
