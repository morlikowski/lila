Um ritual é um conjunto de gestos, palavras e formalidades, várias vezes atribuídas de um valor simbólico, cuja performance das quais é usualmente prescrita por uma tradições da comunidade. 
<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Um ritual pode ser executado a intervalos regulares, ou em situações específicas. Pode ser executado por um único indivíduo, um grupo, ou por uma comunidade inteira; em locais arbitrários, específicos, ou diante de determinadas pessoas. Um ritual pode ser restrito a certo subgrupo da comunidade, e pode permitir ou sublinhar a passagem entre condições sociais ou religiosas.

Os propósitos dos rituais são variados, eles incluem a concordância com obrigações religiosas ou ideais, satisfação de necessidades espirituais ou emocionais dos praticantes, fortalecimento de laços sociais, demonstração de respeito ou submissão, estabelecendo afiliação, obtendo aceitação social ou aprovação para certo evento - ou, às vezes, apenas pelo prazer do ritual em si.

Rituais de vários tipos são característicos de quase todas sociedades humanas conhecidas, passadas ou atuais. Elas podem incluir os vários ritos de adoração e sacramentos de religiões organizadas e cultos, mas também os ritos de passagem de certas sociedades, coroação, posse presidencial, casamentos e funerais, eventos esportivos, dentre outros. Várias atividades que são ostensivamente executadas para concretizar propósitos, como uma execução de pena de morte, e simpósios científicos, são carregados com ações simbólicas prescritas por regulamentos ou tradição, e portanto parcialmente ritualísticas por natureza. Várias ações comuns como aperto de mão ou dizer oi são rituais.

Qualquer atitude repetida de igual forma mais de uma vez pode ser considerada um ritual. Porém um ritual não precisa ser necessariamente sem lógica. Por exemplo: Para alguém sair com um automóvel precisa cumprir com um "ritual". Algo mais ou menos assim:
- Desativar o alarme;
- Abrir a porta;
- Entrar no carro;
- Fechar a porta;
- Colocar o cinto de segurança;
- Checar os retrovisores (internos e externos);
- Verificar se o câmbio está no "ponto morto" (ou neutro);
- Dar a partida;
- Sinalizar a saída;
- Observar o trânsito e
- Arrancar o veículo.

A '''ritual''' is a set of actions, often thought to have symbolic value, the performance of which is usually prescribed by a religion or by the traditions of a community by religious or political laws because of the perceived efficacy of those actions<ref></ref><ref></ref>

A ritual may be performed at regular intervals, or on specific occasions, or at the discretion of individuals or communities. It may be performed by a single individual, by a group, or by the entire community; in arbitrary places, or in places especially reserved for it; either in public, in private, or before specific people.  A ritual may be restricted to a certain subset of the community, and may enable or underscore the passage between religious or social states.

The purposes of rituals are varied; they include compliance with religious obligations or ideals, satisfaction of spiritual or emotional needs of the practitioners, strengthening of social bonds, demonstration of respect or submission, stating one's affiliation, obtaining social acceptance or approval for some event — or, sometimes, just for the pleasure of the ritual itself.

Rituals of various kinds are a feature of almost all known human societies, past or present. They include not only the various rites of passage of certain societies, oaths of allegiance, execution of criminals, and scientific symposia, are loaded with purely symbolic actions prescribed by regulations or tradition, and thus partly ritualistic in nature. Even common actions like  hand-shaking and saying hello are rituals.

In any case, an essential feature of a ritual is that the actions and their symbolism are not arbitrarily chosen by the performers, nor dictated by logic or necessity, but either are prescribed and imposed upon the performers by some external source or are inherited unconsciously from social traditions.

==Ritual actions==
Due to their symbolic nature, there are hardly any limits to the kind of actions that may be incorporated in a ritual.  The rites of past and present societies have typically involved special gestures and words, recitation of fixed texts, performance of special songs or drugs, and much more. Religious rituals have also included animal sacrifice, human sacrifice, ritual suicide, and ritual murder. Ritual lamentation -- song performed with weeping --  in many societies was regarded as required to ritually carry the departed soul to a safe afterlife (Tolbert 1990a, 1990b; Wilce 2006).

==Purposes==
Ritual serves diverse purposes including, but not limited to:
*Worship
*Ritual purification with the aim of removing uncleanliness, which may be real or symbolic.
*Atonement
*Dedication
*Education

==Religious==

In religion, a ritual can comprise the prescribed outward forms of performing, the ''cultus'' or cult of a particular observation within a religion or religious denomination. Although ritual is often used in context with worship performed in a church, the actual relationship between any religion's doctrine and its ritual(s) can vary considerably from organized religion to non-institutionalized spirituality, such as ayahuasca shamanism as practiced by the Urarina of the upper Amazon. Rituals often have a close connection with reverence, thus a ritual in many cases expresses reverence for a deity or idealized state of humanity.  

However, despite these understandings of ritual, the significance of ritual as a force for creating and maintaining religions has been largely under-studied.  The possibilities allowed by ritual's distinctive combination of traditional meaning with instrumental or partially instrumental actions has been underestimated by many religious studies scholars who instead account for the formation of religious groups in terms of "expression" of mental beliefs (or other mentalistic accounts) rather than in terms of social bodily actions that become symbolic over time.

==Sociology==
Rituals have formed a part of human culture for tens of thousands of years. The earliest known undisputed evidence of burial rituals dates from the Upper Paleolithic. (Older skeletons show no signs of deliberate 'burial', and as such lack clear evidence of having been ritually treated.)

Alongside the personal dimensions of worship and reverence, rituals can have a more basic social function in expressing, fixing and reinforcing the shared values and beliefs of a society.  This function can be exploited for political ends, though it lies at the heart of most sociological understandings of religious ritual.  

Rituals can aid in creating a firm sense of group identity.  Humans have used rituals to create social bonds and even to nourish interpersonal relationships.

==Anthropology==
Anthropologists have found rituals performed across the globe, in every conceivable culture.  In its most basic elements ritual is one of many Biogenetic Structuralists. Anthropologists from Emile Durkheim through Turner and contemporary theorists like Michael Silverstein (2004) treat ritual as social action aimed at particular transformations often conceived in cosmic terms. Though the transformations can also be thought of as personal (e.g. the fertility and healing rituals Turner describes), even an apparently secular goal like uniting the warring states during the American Civil War (Lincoln's Gettysburg Address [for an semiotic-anthropological analysis, see Silverstein 2002]  becomes a sort of cosmic event, one stretching into "eternity."

==Fraternal==
Nearly all fraternities and sororities have rituals incorporated into their structure, from elaborate and sometimes "secret" initiation rites, to the formalized structure of convening a meeting.  Thus, numerous aspects of ritual and ritualistic proceedings are engrained into the workings of the societies.

==Psychology==
In psychology, the term ''ritual'' refers to a repetitive, systematic behavioral process enacted in order to neutralize or prevent anxiety and is a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
