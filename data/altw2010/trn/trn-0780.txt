Josep Calveras used it for the first time in 1925, in his work ''La reconstrucció del llenguatge literari català'': «"Catalan-Valencian-Balear" would be the proper name that would satisfy everyone, if it were not because it is too long and the philologists are used to say briefly: Catalan language».

'''Valencian''' (''valencià'') is the historical, traditional, and official name used in the Catalan''''' (''català''). 

Valencian is also spoken in small numbers (less than 500) in el Carxe, a rural area in the Region de Murcia adjoining the Valencian Community. Valencian does not have any official recognition in this area.

According to the "Law of Use and Education of Valencian" approved in 1982, Valencian is the Valencian Community's own language, and its citizens have the right to know it and to use it. 

According to a survey conducted by the Generalitat Valenciana in June 2005, approximately 94% of the Valencian population could understand it, 78% could speak and read it, and around 50% could write it.

A study <ref>http://www.ua.es/uem/docs/noticies/20051025elpval_9.pdf</ref> published by the Generalitat Valenciana (Servei d’Investigació i Estudis Sociolinguístics) in October 2005 revealed that most Valencians do not usually speak in Valencian. According to the study, which sampled more than 6,600 people in the provinces of Castellon, Valencia, and Alicante, 39.5 percent of residents use the Valencian language at home, while 33 percent speak Valencian with their friends and just 18.8 percent speak Valencian in large department stores.

The survey also revealed that because of recent immigration there had been a sharp increase in the number of residents who claimed no understanding of Valencian.

== Different meanings ==
There is consensus amongst linguists that ''Valencian'' is the common name for the '''Catalan language''' as spoken in the Valencian Community. 

Specifically, Valencian is the most distinctive and established Western variety, with a sound written tradition which started as early as the 15th century. It can be then distinguished from the other major standard, the "Catalan of Barcelona" or Central Catalan group of varieties.

However some in Valencia, refusing the academic consensus, use ''Valencian'' (especially ''llengua valenciana'', "Valencian language") to refer to this variety as if it were different from the Catalan language as a whole.

 
=== About the name ===
An important subgroup of those linguists, mostly from the local official Spanish, which is also used under another name, Castilian (see names given to the Spanish language for further information).

In May 2006, the Spanish Supreme Court revoked the instruction ordered by the Valencian Education Department in 1995, which had established that validation of Catalan language qualifications issued by either the Catalan or Balearic autonomous governments no longer applied in the Valencian Community.<ref>[http://www.ciemen.org/mercator/notidetail.cfm?IDA=890&lg=gb the Supreme Court of Spain rules that Catalan and Valencian are different designations that one common language receives in different territories]</ref>.

== Language or Catalan dialect? ==

All universities teaching Romance languages, and virtually all linguists, consider Valencian and Catalan linguistic variants of the same language (such as with Canadian French and Metropolitan French). 

Valencian would serve as an Catalan domain, in that its rules are established by an autonomous language academy (the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua) and given the fact that it shows a slightly different standard<ref>[http://www.uv.es/calaforr/actint.html comunicació Galícia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

There is a roughly continuous set of dialects covering the various regional forms of Catalan/Valencian, with no break at the border between Catalonia and the Valencian Community (i.e. villages contiguous to both sides of the border speak exactly the same), and the various forms of Catalan language, among them, the Valencian ones, are basically mutually intelligible. This is so even though often only educated speakers may have real comprehensive linguistic competence, like it is the case when the most divergent Eastern dialects such as the one from Alghero or from the Balearics are confronted to Valencian. 

Academics almost universally believe that Valencian has its origin in the Catalan that was brought to the territories that became the Spanish, ''Castile moved south conquering New Castile and Aragonese and Castilian languages).

The Aragonese professor Antonio Ubieto Arteta in his book ''Origenes del Reino de Valencia'', which is based on the numbers from ''El llibre dels repartiments'' (a book by James I the Conqueror which serves as the official account of the Reconquesta) challenged this view, claiming that the percentage of immigration from Catalonia is only 5% of the total immigration, during the conquest and the subsequent XIV and XV centuries. The population of Valencia remained 70% Mozarabic and Moorish, 11% originating from the rest of Castile, 10% from the Crown of Aragon, and 7% from foreign countries. 

His claims have not been supported by anyone else in the mainstream academic world. On the contrary, further modern research such as by Valencian Medieval History professor Enric Guinot has even raised the immigrating population to more than 90% in certain areas. This divergence is based on a difference of methodology. While Ubieta focuses on the origins of the nobles who owned new lands, Guinot reads the towns' tax list in order to find the origin of the surnames of the new neighbors. In this way, Guinot claims an 80% new-Catalan population in Puçol and a 12% one in Segorbe (nowadays, Valencian is spoken in Puçol, whereas Spanish is used in Segorbe).

That notwithstanding, there are examples of language change without involving a large scale population movement, notably in South America (where indigenous languages were replaced by Spanish with little inward migration) as well as Ireland, Wales, and Scotland (where indigenous languages were similarly replaced by English within the space of few generations).

The issue of Valencian filiation is the product of hundreds of years of political evolution, throughout which the former Kingdom of Valencia and the former Principality of Catalonia developed in quite different ways. Individual Valencians have both embraced and rejected a Catalan background, and, accordingly, both regions have often been in conflict. Given this historic background, it is perhaps not surprising that a linguistic turf war erupted over the status of the dialect spoken in Valencia. The different background and evolution of local elites in Valencia and Balearic Catalan or Algherese have not challenged their Catalan filiation (or done so to a much lesser degree, in the Balearic case).

The current official definition, according to the Spanish and Valencian governments, is somewhat unclear. The Valencian Statute of Autonomy<ref>[http://www.gva.es/cidaj/cas/c-normas/5-1982.htm#8 Autonomy Statute]</ref> refers to the Valencian language as ''valencià'' (Valencian) and could be interpreted as saying that Valencian is a language in its own right. Also, the university master degree is called ''Filologia Valenciana'' rather than ''Filologia Catalana'' as elsewhere. 
But the ''Academia Valenciana de la Llengua'' (AVL) —an official and state-bound entity created to regulate Valencian orthography— does state that Catalan and Valencian are the same language, and the standard taught by public educative institutions such as schools or universities does follow the AVL rules. Moreover, language certificates issued by public entities of all three Autonomous Communities (Valencian Community, Catalonia, and the Balearic Islands) are mutually endorsed.

All in all, the AVL does set a separate written official standard for Valencian, and this is accepted as valid by the academic world since the two written standards are completely mutually inteligible and the AVL works together with the Institut d'Estudis Catalans, which sets the orthographic standard for the rest of the language.

Rejecting the current situation, there is a series of civil society private associations, specially within the Valencia province, from which the most influential is ''Lo Rat Penat''. These associations campaign for Valencian as a separate language with a different written norm and have supported attempts by local mainly right-wing politicians to split Valencian and Catalan norms apart. Their theories have not been supported in academic circles outside their own.

On August 10, 2007, in reply to a blaverist demand, a different SIL code for '''val''' as different from '''ca''' was rejected <ref>[http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/PastComments/CR_Comments_2006-129.pdf Comments received for<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> by the International Organization for Standardization, with the reasoning that "''language identifiers are not language abbreviations''". However, for those aiming to make clear the variant used a proper subtag exists, '''ca-valencia''', which was refused as well by the plaintiffs.
