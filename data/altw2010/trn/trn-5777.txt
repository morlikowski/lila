'''Крике́т'''&nbsp;— вид спорту, командна гра з битою.

У крикет грають на овальному полі із доріжкою та ворітцями (вікетом) в центрі двома командами з одинадцяти гравців у кожній. Мета гри в тому, щоб збити поперечину з ворітець. Одна з команд намагається зробити це, кидаючи м'яч, а друга захищає ворітця, відбиваючи м'яч за допомогою битки (але не жодною частиною тіла). При вдалому відбиванні гравці команди, яка захищає вікет, роблять перебіжки, міняючись місцями. Якщо нападникам вдалося збити вікет, спіймати м'яч в повітрі або ж команда-захисник порушує правила, один із її гравців вибуває з гри. Коли 10 гравців команди-захисника ворітець вибуває, команди міняються ролями. Виграє та з команд, яка зробила більше перебіжок.

У своїй найвищій формі&nbsp;— тест-матчі між збірними&nbsp;— гра складається із двох інінгів для кожної команди й триває п'ять днів.

Крикет&nbsp;— одна з найпопулярніших у світі ігор, поступаючись за кількістю гравців мабуть лише Індії, Австралії, країнах Карибського басейну. В Україні крикет майже невідомий.

'''Cricket''' is a bat-and-ball teams, usually of eleven players each.<ref>
</ref>
A cricket match is played on a grass field, roughly oval in shape, in the centre of which is a flat strip of ground 22&nbsp;yards (20.12&nbsp;m) long, called a wicket, usually made of wood, is placed at each end of the pitch. 

The bowler, a player from the fielding team, bowls a hard, fist-sized out.  The batsman — if he or she does not get out — may run between the wickets, exchanging ends with a second batsman (the "non-striker"), who has been waiting near the bowler's wicket. Each completed exchange of ends scores one run.  Runs are also scored if the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the playing area.  The match is won by the team that scores more runs.

Cricket has been an established team sport for hundreds of years and more than 100 countries are affiliated to the Commonwealth.  In many countries including West Indies, cricket is the most popular sport. In other sports are more popular in particular areas, cricket has been described as the "national sport" and has had a role in forming the national identity.<ref name="aus"></ref>   It is also a major sport in England, New Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe .  Many countries also have well-established amateur club competitions, including the Netherlands, Kenya, Nepal and Argentina.
 
The sport is followed with passion in many different parts of the world.  It has even occasionally given rise to diplomatic outrage, notoriously the Test series in the early 1930s (which led to a temporary deterioration in relations between Australia and the United Kingdom).

==Overview==

The aim of the batting team is to score as many runs as possible. A run is scored when both batsmen successfully move to their respective opposite ends of the pitch. (The batsmen will usually only attempt to score runs after the striker has hit the ball, but this is not required by the rules—the batsmen can attempt runs at any time after the ball has been bowled.) Runs are also scored if the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the playing area (this scores six runs if the ball crosses the boundary without having touched the ground, or four runs otherwise), or if the bowler commits some technical infringement like bowling the ball out of reach of the batsman.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/rules_and_equipment/4183254.stm BBC SPORT | Cricket | Laws & Equipment | How runs are scored<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The aim of the bowler's team is to get each batsman out (this is called a "taking a wicket", or a "dismissal").<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/rules_and_equipment/4183172.stm BBC SPORT | Cricket | Laws & Equipment | The aim of cricket<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Dismissals are achieved in a variety of ways. The most direct way is for the bowler to bowl the ball so that the batsman misses it and it hits the bail.  While the batsmen are attempting a run, the fielders may dismiss either batsman by using the ball to knock the bails off the set of stumps to which the batsman is closest before he has grounded himself or his bat in the crease. Other ways for the fielding side to dismiss a batsman include catching the ball off the bat before it touches the ground, or having the batsman adjudged "leg before wicket" (abbreviated "L.B.W." or "lbw") if the ball strikes the batsman's body and would have gone on to hit the wicket.<ref>"Ways of getting out" section at http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/rules_and_equipment/default.stm</ref>  Once the batsmen are not attempting to score any more runs, the ball is "dead", and is bowled again (each attempt at bowling the ball is referred to as a "ball" or a "delivery").<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/rules_and_equipment/default.stm Law 23]</ref>

The game is divided into overs of six (legal) balls.  At the end of an over another bowler from the fielding side bowls from the opposite end of the pitch.  The two umpires also change positions between overs (the umpire previously at square-leg becomes the bowler's umpire at what is now the bowling end, and ''vice versa'').  The fielders also usually change positions between overs.

Once out, a batsman is replaced by the next batsman in the team's line-up. (The batting side can reorder their line-up at any time, but no batsman may bat twice in one innings.)  The innings (singular) of the batting team ends when the tenth batsman is given out, leaving one batsman not out but without a partner.  When this happens, the team is said to be "all out". (In limited overs cricket the innings ends either when the batting team is all out or a predetermined number of overs has been bowled.) At the end of an innings, the two teams exchange roles, and the side that has been fielding bats.

A team's score is reported in terms of the number of runs scored and the number of batsmen that have been dismissed. For example, if five batsmen are out and the team has scored 224 runs, they are said to have scored 224 for the loss of 5 wickets (commonly shortened to "224 for five" and written 224/5 or, in Australia, "five for 224" and 5/224).

The team that has scored more runs at the end of the completed match wins.  Different varieties of the game have different definitions of "completion"; for instance there may be restrictions on the number of overs, the number of innings, and the number of balls in each innings.

==Results==

If the team that bats last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, the team is said to have "lost by ''n'' runs" (where ''n'' is the difference between the number of runs scored by the teams).  If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have "won by ''n'' wickets", where ''n'' is the number of wickets left to fall.  For instance a team that passes its opponents' score having only lost six wickets would have won "by four wickets".

In a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total.  The team with the greater score is then said to have ''won by an innings and ''n'' runs'', and does not need to bat again: ''n'' is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores.

If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side. In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a draw.

If the match has only a single innings per side, then a maximum number of deliveries for each innings is often imposed. Such a match is called a "limited overs" or "one-day" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth-Lewis method after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a "no-result" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather.

==Laws of cricket==

The game is played in accordance with 42 laws, which have been developed by the Marylebone Cricket Club in discussion with the main cricketing nations. Teams may agree before a game to introduce other rules or alter some of the existing rules. In particular, there are a number of modifications to rules dictating fielding positions for professional limited overs matches. 

===Players and officials===
====Players====

A team consists of eleven players. Depending on his or her primary skills, a player may be classified as a specialist bowler. A balanced team usually has five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers. Teams nearly always include a specialist captain, who is responsible for making tactical decisions such as determining the batting order, the placement of fielders and the rotation of bowlers.

A player who excels in both batting and bowling is known as an all-rounder. One who excels as a batsman and wicket-keeper is known as a "wicket-keeper/batsman", sometimes regarded as a type of all-rounder. True 
all-rounders are rare; most players focus on either batting or bowling skills.

====Umpires====

Two on-field umpires preside over a match. One umpire stands behind the bowler's wicket, and adjudicates on most decisions. The other (the "square leg umpire") stands with a side view of the batsman (usually near the fielding position called square leg), and assists in decisions for which he or she has a better view. In some professional matches the facility exists for them to refer some decisions to a match referee ensures that play is within the laws of cricket and the spirit of the game.  The third umpire and referee do not take the field during play.

====Scorers====

Two scorers are appointed; usually, one is provided by each team.  The laws of cricket specify that the official scorers are to record all runs scored, wickets taken and (where appropriate) overs bowled.  They are to acknowledge signals from the umpires, and to check the accuracy of the score regularly both with each other and, at playing intervals, with the umpires.  In practice scorers also keep track of other matters, such as bowlers' analyses, the rate at which the teams bowl their overs, and team statistics such as averages and records.  In international and national cricket competitions, the media often require notification of records and statistics, so unofficial scorers often keep tally for broadcast commentators and newspaper journalists.  The official scorers occasionally make mistakes, but unlike umpires' mistakes these can be corrected after the event.

===The playing field===

The cricket field consists of a large, often circular or oval-shaped, grassy ground. There are no fixed dimensions for the field but its boundary'', is marked, often with a rope or a painted line.

====The pitch====

right|thumb|150px|A [[wicket consists of three stumps that are hammered into the ground, and topped with two bails.]]
150px|A perspective view of the [[cricket pitch from the bowler's end.]]
450px|The Cricket pitch dimensions<br/>
Most of the action takes place in the centre of this ground, on a rectangular clay strip usually with short grass called the '''pitch'''. The pitch measures 10&nbsp;×&nbsp;66&nbsp;feet (3.05&nbsp;×&nbsp;20.12&nbsp;m). The longer dimension of the pitch is also a unit of length known as a chain.

At each end of the pitch three upright wooden stakes, called the stumps, are hammered into the ground. Two wooden crosspieces, known as the bails, sit in grooves atop the stumps, linking each to its neighbour. Each set of three stumps and two bails is collectively known as a wicket. One end of the pitch is designated the "batting end" where the bowler runs in to bowl.

The area of the field on the side of the line joining the wickets where the batsman holds his bat (the right-hand side for a right-handed batsman, the left for a left-hander) is known as the "off side", the other as the "leg side" or "on side".

Lines drawn or painted on the pitch are known as creases. Creases are used to adjudicate the dismissals of batsmen and to determine whether a delivery is legal.right|thumb|150px|A typical cricket field.

====The nature of the pitch====
Pitches vary in consistency, and thus in the amount of bounce, spin, and seam movement available to the bowler.  Hard pitches are usually good to bat on because of high but even bounce.  Dry pitches tend to deteriorate for batting as cracks often appear, and when this happens spinners can play a major role.  Damp pitches, or pitches covered in grass (termed "green" pitches), allow good fast bowlers to extract extra bounce and seam movement. Such pitches tend to offer help to fast bowlers throughout the match, but become better for batting as the game goes on.

====Parts of the field====
For some limited-over matches, there are two additional field markings. A painted oval is made by drawing a semicircle of 30&nbsp;yards (27.4&nbsp;m) radius from the centre of each wicket with respect to the breadth of the pitch and joining them with lines parallel, 30 yards (27.4&nbsp;m) to the length of the pitch. This line, commonly known as the "circle", divides the field into an infield and outfield. Two circles of radius 15&nbsp;yards (13.7&nbsp;m), centred on each wicket and often marked by dots, define the "close-infield". The infield, outfield, and the close-infield are used to enforce fielding restrictions.

====Placements of players====
right|thumb|150px|[[Fielding positions in cricket for a right-handed batsman. The named positions are only indicative: the fielders may stand anywhere. The bowler and wicket-keeper are always in roughly the same position, and there are only nine other fielders, so there are always many unprotected areas.]]
The batting team always has two batsmen on the field. One batsman, known as the "striker", faces and plays the balls bowled by the bowler. His or her partner stands at the bowling end and is known as the "non-striker". 

The fielding team has eleven players on the ground.  One of them is the current bowler.  The wicket-keeper, who generally acts in that role for the whole innings, stands or crouches behind the wicket at the batting end.  The captain of the fielding team spreads his or her remaining nine players — the fielders — around the ground, positioned according to the team's strategy.

===Match structure===
====The toss====

The two opposing captains toss a coin before the match, and the captain who wins chooses either to bat or bowl first.  The captain's decision is usually based on whether the team's bowlers are likely to gain immediate advantage from the pitch and weather conditions (these can vary significantly), or whether it is more likely that the pitch will deteriorate and make batting more difficult later in the game.

====Overs====

Each innings is divided into overs, each consisting of six consecutive legal deliveries bowled by the same bowler. For the definition of illegal deliveries, see Extras.  No bowler may bowl two consecutive overs, so at the end of the over the bowler takes up a fielding position and another player bowls.

Overs are bowled from alternate ends of the pitch; at the end of each over the umpires swap, the umpire at the bowler's end moving to square leg, and the umpire at square leg moving to the new bowler's end.  The fielders also usually change positions.

====End of an innings====

An innings is completed if:
# Ten out of eleven batsmen are out (dismissed); the team are said to be "all out".
# The team has only one batsman left who can bat, one or more of the remaining players being unavailable owing to injury, illness or absence; again, the team is said to be "all out".
# The team batting last reaches the score required to win the match.
# The predetermined number of overs has been bowled (in a one-day match only, most commonly 50 overs).
# A captain declares his team's innings closed (this does not apply in one-day limited over matches).

====Playing time====

Typically, two-innings matches are played over three to five days with at least six hours of cricket played each day. One-innings matches are usually played in one day, and often last six hours or more. There are usually formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea, and brief informal breaks for drinks. There is also a short interval between innings.

The game is usually only played in dry weather; play is also usually stopped if it becomes too dark for the batsmen to be able to see the ball safely. Some one-day games are now played under floodlights but, apart from a few experimental games in Australia, floodlights are not used in longer games. Professional cricket is usually played outdoors. These requirements mean that in England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe the game is usually restricted to the summer. In the West Indies, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh games are played in the winter. These countries' hurricane and monsoon seasons coincide with their summer.

====Batting====

<!-- Write on my Talk Page if you don't agree this pic is better than Ponting's - Sai2020 -->
The batsman may play a "shot" or "stroke", attempting to hit the bowled ball with the flat surface of the bat.  If the ball brushes the side of the bat it is called an "edge". There is no requirement for the batsman to play a shot, and there is no requirement to run if the ball is struck. The batsman automatically scores runs if he hits the ball to the boundary. Shots are named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed. As part of the team's strategy, the player may bat defensively, blocking the ball downwards, or aggressively, hitting the ball hard to empty spaces in order to score runs. 

Batsmen come in to bat in a batting order, decided by the team captain. The first two batsmen - the "openers" - usually face the most hostile bowling, from fresh fast bowlers with a new ball. The top batting positions are usually given to the most competent batsmen in the team, and the non-batsmen typically bat last.  The batting order is not agreed beforehand, and if a wicket falls any player who has not batted yet may bat next.

====Run scoring====
left|thumb|150px|The directions in which a right-handed [[batsman intends to send the ball when playing various cricketing shots. The diagram for a left-handed batsman is a mirror image of this one.]]
right|thumb|300px|How runs are scored and teams win a match.

To score a run, a striker must run to the opposite end of the pitch, while his non-striking partner runs to his end. To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run). If the striker hits the ball well enough, the batsmen may double back to score two or more runs. However, no rule requires the batsman to run upon striking the ball. The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball's position, and this is communicated by calling: "yes", "no" and "wait" are often heard.  The batsmen swap ends every time an odd number of runs are scored.

If a fielder knocks the bails off the stumps with the ball while no part of the batsman is grounded behind the popping crease, the batsman nearer the broken wicket is run out.  The batsman may ground the bat, provided he or she is holding it.

If the ball reaches the boundary, then runs are automatically scored: six if the ball goes over the boundary without touching the ground, four if it touched the ground. These are scored instead of any runs the batsmen may have already run (unless they have run more, which is unlikely), and they return to the ends at which they started.

====Extras====

Every run scored by the batsmen contributes to the team's total. A team's total also includes a number of runs which are unaccredited to any batsmen. These runs are known as extras; in Australia they are also called "sundries". 

===Bowling and dismissals===
====Bowling====
thumb|556px|left|A typical bowling action.
thumb|200px|right|[[Andrew Flintoff of England bowling.]]
thumb|300px|right|The basics of bowling.

A bowler delivers the ball toward the batsmen: during the bowling action the elbow may be held at any angle and may bend further, but may not straighten out. If the elbow straightens illegally then the square-leg umpire may call no-ball. The current laws allow a bowler to straighten his arm 15 degrees or less.

The bowler's primary goal is usually to get the batsman out; the most common modes of dismissal (except run out) are credited to the bowler, who is said to have ''taken a wicket''.  Dismissing an accomplished batsman is more difficult than dismissing a non-batsman.    The bowler's secondary task is usually to limit the numbers of runs scored.  Occasionally the match situation makes it more important to limit runs than take wickets.

There are many types of bowler, and many nuances of bowling techniques.  Two categories are pace bowlers, who aim to bowl quicker than the batsman's reaction speed, and spin bowlers who bowl slower deliveries that bounce and curve in unpredictable ways.

====Dismissal of a batsman====

There are ten ways in which a batsman may be dismissed. Once a batsman is dismissed, he leaves the field to be replaced by another batsman.  When the tenth batsmen is out, and only one batsman remains undismissed, the side is "all out" and the innings is over.

Many modes of dismissal require the wicket to be "put down". The wicket is put down if a bail is dislodged from the top of the stumps; or if a stump is struck out of the ground either by the ball or by a fielder using the hand in which the ball is being held. Of the following ten modes of dismissal, the first five are common; Hit wicket is less common while the last four are technicalities that rarely occur. The ten modes are:

#'''Caught''' — When a fielder catches the ball before it bounces and after the batsman has struck it with the bat or it has come into contact with the batsman's glove while it is in contact with the bat handle.  The bowler and catcher are both credited with the dismissal. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-32-caught,58,AR.html Law 32])
#'''Bowled''' — When a delivered ball hits the stumps at the batsman's end, and dislodges one or both of the bails. This happens regardless of whether the batsman has edged the ball onto the stumps or not. The bowler is credited with the dismissal. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-30-bowled,56,AR.html Law 30])
#'''Leg before wicket (lbw)''' — When a delivered ball strikes the batsman's leg, pad or body, and the umpire judges that the ball would otherwise have struck the stumps.  The laws of cricket stipulate certain exceptions.  For instance, a delivery pitching outside the line of leg stump should not result in an lbw dismissal, while a delivery hitting the batsman outside the line of the off stump should result in an lbw dismissal only if the batsman makes no attempt to play the ball with the bat.  The bowler is credited with the dismissal.
#'''Run out''' — When a fielder, bowler or wicket-keeper removes one or both of the bails with the ball by hitting the stumps whilst a batsman is still running between the two ends. The ball can either hit the stumps directly or the fielder's hand with the ball inside it can be used to dislodge the bails. Such a dismissal is not officially credited to any player, although the identities of the fielder or fielders involved are often noted in brackets on the scorecard. 
#'''Stumped''' — When the batsman leaves his crease in playing a delivery, voluntarily or involuntarily, but the ball goes to the wicket-keeper who uses it to remove one or both of the bails through hitting the bail(s) or the wicket before the batsman has remade his ground.  The bowler and wicket-keeper are both credited.  This generally requires the keeper to be standing within arm's length of the wicket, which is done mainly to spin bowling.  ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-39-stumped,65,AR.html Law 39])
#'''Hit wicket''' — When the batsman knocks the stumps with either the body or the bat, causing one or both of the bails to be dislodged, either in playing a shot or in taking off for the first run.  The bowler is credited with the dismissal. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-35-hit-wicket,61,AR.html Law 35])
#'''Handled the ball''' — When the batsman deliberately handles the ball without the permission of the fielding team.  No player is credited with the dismissal. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-33-handled-the-ball,59,AR.html Law 33])
#'''Hit the ball twice''' — When the batsman deliberately strikes the ball a second time, except for the sole purpose of guarding his wicket.  No player is credited with the dismissal. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-34-hit-the-ball-twice,60,AR.html Law 34])
#'''Obstructing the field''' — When a batsman deliberately hinders a fielder attempting to field the ball. No player is credited with the dismissal. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-37-obstructing-the-field,63,AR.html Law 37])
#'''Timed out''' — When a new batsman takes more than three minutes to take his position in the field to replace a dismissed batsman. (If the delay is protracted, the umpires may decide that the batting side has forfeited the match).  This rule prevents the batting team using up time to unfair advantage. No player is credited with the dismissal. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-31-timed-out,57,AR.html Law 31])

A batsman may leave the field without being dismissed. If injured or taken ill the batsman may temporarily retire, and be replaced by the next batsman.  This is recorded as ''retired hurt'' or ''retired ill''. The retiring batsman is not out, and may resume the innings later.  An unimpaired batsman may retire, and this is treated as being dismissed '''retired out'''; no player is credited with the dismissal.

Batsmen cannot be out ''bowled'', ''caught'', ''leg before wicket'', ''stumped'' or ''hit wicket'' off a ''no ball''. They cannot be out ''bowled'', ''caught'', ''leg before wicket'', or ''hit the ball twice'' off a ''wide''.

Some of these modes of dismissal can occur without the bowler bowling a delivery.  The batsman who is not on strike may be run out by the bowler if he leaves his crease before the bowler bowls, and a batsman can be out ''obstructing the field'' or ''retired out'' at any time.  ''Timed out'' is, by its nature, a dismissal without a delivery.  With all other modes of dismissal, only one batsman can be dismissed per ball bowled.
