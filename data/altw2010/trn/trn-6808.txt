Et '''kjøpesenter''' eller '''handlesenter''' er en samling av markedsføres som en enhet under et eget navn. Butikkene i kjøpesentre er som oftest lokalisert i én bygning, eller i flere sammenbygde bygninger. I varmere strøk forekommer også utendørs kjøpesentre.

Selv om bransjesentre ikke er uvanlige, er som oftest butikkene i et kjøpesenter av forskjellig art, slik at kundene kan finne det meste av det de trenger, på ett sted. De fleste kjøpesentrene tilbyr gratis parkeringsplasser til kundene sine.

==Typer kjøpesentre==

Man skiller ofte mellom ''regionssentre'', ''bydelssentre'' og ''sentrumssentre''. Førstnevnte type er gjerne lokalisert utenfor tettbebyggelse, eller i alle fall sentrumsbebyggelse, og det er meningen at kundene skal kjøre dit. Bydelssentre er vanlige i drabantbyer, og disse er gjerne planlagt i forbindelse med utbyggingen.
==Historie==
Hvis man definerer et kjøpesenter som et sted hvor mange butikker (utsalgssteder) holder til under samme tak eller samme bygningskompleks har de eksistert like lenge som byen. I antikkens Roma, i Konstantinopel, 1800-tallets basarer i Oslo, butikkgalleriene i Paris på 1800-tallet.
 
Basarer har vært brukt i muslimske land i flere hundre år. I Paris finnes passasjene som oppstod på Victor Emmanuel II (ita. ''Vittorio Emanuele II''), Italias første konge, og ble bygd av G. Mengoni mellom 1865 og 1878. Parallet med passasjene oppstod de store varehusene. Det første var Bon Marché som ble åpnet i Paris i 1869.

===Det moderne kjøpesenter===
thumb|Glasstak i West Edmonton mall i [[Edmonton i Canada.]]
De første former for moderne kjøpesentre dukket opp i USA i  1916. Market Square i Chicago i Illinois hadde 28 butikker, 12 kontorer og 30 leiligheter samlet rundt en sentral plass, og her var også parkeringsmuligheter. 

Det første fullt utviklede  kjøpesenter slik vi kjenner det idag åpnet i Edina i Minnesota, USA 7. oktober 1956 med Southland Center med 75 000 kvadratmeter grunnflate og 7000 parkeringsplasser.
Dette senteret har 130 butikker i to plan med flere konkurrerende varehus som en del av konseptet.
Slike sentre kaller amerikanerne gjerne "mall". Slik sett kan man hevde at Norge egentlig ikke har kjøpesentre i denne betydningen av ordet. Men likevel kaller vi butikksamlinger helt ned i 5000 kvadratmeter for kjøpesenter i Norge. I USA har kjøpesentrene passert sin storhetstid, og "strip malls" (en ansamling av butikker som ligner de man finner i norske bygder), og "livsstilssentre" (lifestyle centers) - med megabutikker som IKEA, The Home Depot, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Sears/K-mart rundt en parkeringsplass - er i ferd med å ta over forbrukerne.

In most of the world the term ''shopping centre'' is used, especially in Europe and Australasia; however ''shopping mall'' is also used, predominantly in North America, but also to a large extent in Asia.<ref>Urban Geography: A Global Perspective By Michael Pacione</ref> ''Shopping precinct'' and  ''shopping arcade'' are also used.  In North America, the term ''shopping mall'' is usually applied to enclosed retail structures (and may be abbreviated to simply ''mall'') while ''shopping centre'' usually refers to open-air retail complexes.

Malls in Ireland, pronounced "maills", are typically very small shopping centres placed in the centre of town. They average about twenty years in age, with a mix of local shops and chain stores. These malls do not have shops found in the high street or modern shopping centres.

Shopping centres in the United Kingdom can be referred to as "shopping precincts" or just "precincts", but with American-style centres becoming more common in the UK, they are increasingly being referred to as "malls".

Isfahan's Grand Bazaar, which is largely covered, dates from the 10th century A.D. The 10 kilometer long covered Grand Bazaar of Istanbul was built in 15th century and is still one of the largest covered markets in the world with more than 58 streets and 4000 shops. The Oxford Covered Market in Oxford, England was officially opened on 1 November 1774 and still runs today.

An early indoor mall in the United States was the Morgan Park, Duluth, Minnesota, which was built in 1915 and held its grand opening on July 20, 1916. The architect was Dean & Dean from Chicago and the building contractor was George H. Lounsberry from Duluth. The building is two-stories with a full basement and shops were originally located on all three levels. All of the stores were located within the interior of the mall with some shops being accessible from both inside and out.

In the mid-20th century, with the rise of the suburb and automobile culture in the United States, a new style of shopping centre was created away from downtown.

===Early shopping centers===
An early shopping center in the United States was Country Club Plaza, which opened in 1924 in Kansas City, Missouri.  Other important shopping centers built in the 1920s and early 1930s are the Highland Park Village in Dallas, Texas; River Oaks in Houston, Texas; and Park and Shop in Washington, DC. 

However, the concept of the fully-enclosed shopping mall did not appear until the 1950s.  The idea was pioneered by the Northgate Mall, built in north Northland Shopping Center built near Twin Cities suburb of UK, Chrisp Street Market was the first pedestrian shopping area built with a road at the shop fronts.

Allied's chairman B. Earl Puckett confidently announced the Bergen Mall as the largest of ten proposed centers, stating that there were 25 cities that could support such centers and that no more than 50 malls of this type would ever be built nationwide.<ref>"10 Shopping Centers Scheduled For Allied Stores Within 3 Years; Chain' s Chairman Gives Details of Biggest, 7 Miles From George Washington Span, Where Stern Will Open Branch by '57: Store Chain Plans Retail Centers", ''The New York Times'', January 13, 1955. p. 37</ref><ref></ref>

A mall can refer to a shopping mall, which is a place where a collection of shops all adjoin a pedestrian area, or an exclusively pedestrian street, that allows shoppers to walk without interference from vehicle traffic. ''Mall'' is generally used in Britain, to refer to a narrow pedestrian-only street, often covered or between closely spaced buildings (see town centre). A larger, often only partly covered but exclusively pedestrian shopping area is in Britain also termed a ''shopping precinct'' or ''pedestrian precinct''. The majority of British shopping centres are in town centres, usually inserted into old shopping districts, and surrounding by subsidiary open air shopping streets. A number of large out-of-town "regional malls" such as Meadowhall, Sheffield and the Trafford Centre, Manchester were built in the 1980s and 1990s, but there are only ten of them or so and planning regulations prohibit the construction of any more. Out-of-town shopping developments in the UK are now focused on retail parks, which consist of groups of warehouse style shops with individual entrances from outdoors. Planning policy prioritizes the development of existing town centres, although with patchy success.  The Metro centre, Gateshead, is the largest shopping centre in Europe with over 330 shops, 50 restaurants and an 11 screen cinema

In many cases, regional and super-regional malls  exist as parts of large superstructures which often also include office space, residential space, amusement parks and so forth.  This trend can be seen in the construction and design of many modern supermalls such as Cevahir Mall in Turkey. The International Council of Shopping Centers' 1999 definitions<ref>[http://www.icsc.org/srch/lib/SCDefinitions99.pdf International Council of Shopping Centers] Shopping Center Definitions.

=== Regional malls ===
thumb|right|The exterior of the [[Selfridges department store in the Bullring shopping complex in Birmingham, England.]]
A '''regional mall''' is, per the International Council of Shopping Centers, in the United States, a shopping mall which is designed to service a larger area than a conventional shopping mall. As such, it is typically larger with  to  gross leasable area with at least two anchors<ref name="ISCS_definitions-2004">[http://www.icsc.org/srch/lib/USDefinitions.pdf International Council of Shopping Centers] Shopping Center Definitions for the U.S. Information accurate as of 2004. Retrieved Feb 20, 2007.</ref> and offers a wider selection of stores. Given their wider service area, these malls tend to have higher-end stores that need a larger area in order for their services to be profitable. Regional malls are also found as tourist attractions in vacation areas.

=== Super-regional malls ===
A '''super-regional mall''' is, per the ICSC, in the U.S. a shopping mall with over <ref name="ISCS_definitions-2004"/> of gross leasable area, and which serves as the dominant shopping venue for the region in which it located. 

===Outlet malls===

An outlet mall (or outlet centre) is a type of shopping mall in which manufacturers sell their products directly to the public through their own stores. Other stores in outlet malls are operated by retailers selling returned goods and discontinued products, often at heavily reduced prices. Outlet stores were found as early as 1936, but the first multi-outlet mall, Memphis.<ref>[http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/soc/shoppingcenter.html University of San Diego webpage] Retrieved June 1, 2007</ref>
