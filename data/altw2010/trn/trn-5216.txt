'''Vienna''' (in German ''Wien'' pronounced /viːn/; /viˈɛnə/ English; see also other names) is the capital of Austria, and is also one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city; with a population of about 1.7 million
<ref>[http://www.statistik.at/web_de/statistiken/bevoelkerung/bevoelkerungsstand_jahres-_und_quartalswerte/bevoelkerung_zu_jahres-_quartalsanfang/023582.html official]</ref> (2.3 million within the cultural, economic and political center. It is the 10th largest city by population in the quality of living (as of 2008). Vienna is host to many major international organizations such as the United Nations and OPEC.
Vienna lies in the very east of Austria and is close to the quality of life.<ref></ref>

==History==

Founded around 500 BC, Vienna was originally a Roman frontier city (Vindobona) guarding the Roman Empire against Germanic tribes to the north.

Vienna came under threat from the Mongolian Empire that stretched over much of present day Russia and China in the 1200s.  However, due to the death of its leader Genghis Khan, the Mongolian armies receded from the European frontier and were not to return.

During the Ottoman armies were stopped twice outside Vienna (see Siege of Vienna, 1529 and Battle of Vienna, 1683).

thumb|left|Vienna in 1858
In 1804, Vienna became capital of the Austrian Empire and continued to play a major role in European and World politics, including hosting the 1814 Congress of Vienna. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 Vienna remained the capital of what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the latter half of the 19th century the city developed what had previously been the bastions and glacis into the Ringstraße, a major prestige project. Former suburbs were incorporated, and the city of Vienna grew dramatically. 

In 1918, after Anschluß'') and the end of the Second World War, Vienna lost its status as a capital to Berlin.

In 1945, the Vienna Offensive was successfully launched by the Soviets against the Germans holding Vienna. The city was besieged for about two weeks before it fell to the Soviets. After 1945, Vienna again became the capital of Austria. It was initially divided into four zones by the 4 Powers and was governed by the Allied Commission for Austria. During the 10 years of foreign occupation Vienna became a hot-bed for international espionage between the Western and Eastern blocs.

In the 1970s Austrian Chancellor UNIDO, UNOV, CTBTO and UNODC), the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

===Historical population===
thumb|right|Inhabitants according to official census figures: 1800 to 2005
Due to Czechs and Hungarians returned to their ancestral countries, resulting in a decline in the Viennese population. At the height of the immigration, about one third of the people living in Vienna were of Slavic or Hungarian descent.
By 2001, only 16% of people living in Vienna had nationalities other than Austrian, nearly half of which were from the former Turkish (39,000 or 2.5%), Polish (13,600 or 0.9%) and German (12,700 or 0.8%).<ref name="census"></ref>

Vienna lies in eastern Austria, at the easternmost extension of the Alps in the Vienna Basin. The earliest settlement, at the location of today's inner city, were south of the meandering Danube while the city now spans both sides of the river. Elevation ranges from 151 to 542 m.

Vienna has temperate climate with warm summers and cold winters.
The average temperatures in the summer highs is into the mid 20Cs (upper 70Fs) and overnight lows into the high 10Cs (lower 60Fs); although the winter highs are just above freezing and the overnight lows just below.

==Districts==
thumb|The [[Rathaus, Vienna|Rathaus serves as the seat of the mayor and city council of the city of Vienna]]
thumb|[[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|Stephansdom]]

Vienna is composed of 23 districts (''Bezirke''). Legally, they are not districts in the sense of administrative bodies with explicit powers (such as the districts in the other Austrian states), but mere subdivisions of the city administration. Elections at the district level give the representatives of the districts some political power in fields such as planning and traffic.

The 23 districts are numbered for convenience in a roughly clockwise fashion starting in the city centre:
<table><td><ol>
<li>Innere Stadt
<li>Leopoldstadt
<li>Landstraße
<li>Wieden
<li>Margareten
<li>Mariahilf
<li>Neubau
<li>Josefstadt
<li>Alsergrund
<li>Favoriten
<li>Simmering
<li>Meidling
</ol></td><td><ol start=13>
<li>Hietzing
<li>Penzing
<li>Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus
<li>Ottakring
<li>Hernals
<li>Währing
<li>Döbling
<li>Brigittenau
<li>Floridsdorf
<li>Donaustadt
<li>Liesing
</ol></td></table>

The heart and historical city of Vienna, the Rathaus (town hall), the University, the Parliament, the twin museums of natural history and fine art, and the Staatsoper. It is also the location of the Gothic Stephansdom is located at the centre of the city, on ring road called Gürtel.

Industries are located mostly in the southern and eastern districts. The Innere Stadt is situated away from the main flow of the Danube, but is bounded by the ''Donaukanal'' ("Danube canal"). Vienna's second and twentieth districts are located between the Donaukanal and the Danube River. Across the Danube are the newest districts, which include the location of the Vienna International Centre.

Vienna's postal codes can be determined by the district where a given address is located; 1XXA - 1 denotes Vienna, XX the district number (if it is a single digit then with a leading zero), A is the number of the post office (irrelevant in this case, usually zero). Example: 1070 for Neubau. Exceptions include 1300 for the UN Complex, 1450 for the Austria Center, and 1500 for the Austrian UN forces.

==Politics==
Until 1918, Viennese politics were shaped by the Christian Social Party, in particular long-term mayor First Republic (1918-1934), the Vienna Social Democrats undertook many overdue social reforms. At that time, Vienna's municipal policy was admired by Socialists throughout Europe, who therefore referred to the city as "Red Vienna" (''Rotes Wien''). 

For most of the time since the First World War, the city has been governed by the Social Democratic Party with absolute majorities in the city parliament. Only between 1934 and 1945, when the Social Democratic Party was illegal, mayors were appointed by the austro-fascist and later by the Nazi authorities. The current mayor of Vienna is Michael Häupl. The Social Democrats currently hold 55% of the seats with a 49% share of the vote.<ref> </ref>  Many Austrian political experts believe that if not for the Social Democrats' nearly unbreakable hold on Vienna, the rival Austrian People's Party would dominate Austrian politics.

An example of the city’s many social democratic policies is its low-cost residential estates called ''Gemeindebauten''.

Ever since Vienna obtained federal state (''Bundesland'') status of its own in 1921, the mayor has also had the role of the state governor (''Landeshauptmann''). The Rathaus accommodates the offices of the mayor and the state government (''Landesregierung''). The city is administered by a multitude of departments (''Magistratsabteilungen'').

==Religions==
Vienna is the seat of the Viennese archdiocese, and its acting Cardinal Christoph Schönborn. The religions of the Viennese resident population is divided according to the 2001 census as follows&nbsp;<ref name="census"/>:
{|
|Roman Catholic

===Music, theatre and opera===

:''Translated from here''
Art and culture have a long tradition in Vienna, including classical music and fine arts. The Burgtheater is considered one of the best theaters in the German-speaking world alongside its branch, the Akademietheater. The Volkstheater Wien and the Theater in der Josefstadt also enjoy good reputations. There is also a multitude of smaller theaters, in many cases devoted to less mainstream forms of performing arts, such as modern, experimental plays or cabaret.

Vienna is also home to a number of opera houses, including the Staatsoper and the Volksoper, the latter being devoted to the typical Viennese Johann Strauss).

In recent years, the musicals, although it has recently devoted itself to the opera again. The most successful musical by far was "Elisabeth", which was later translated into several other languages and performed all over the world. The Haus der Musik ("house of music") opened in 2000.

Many Roman Catholic churches in central Vienna also feature performances of religious or other music, including masses sung with classical music and organ.

===Museums===
: ''Translated from here''
The Hofburg is the location of the Schatzkammer (treasury), holding the imperial jewels of the Hapsburg dynasty. The Sisi Museum (a museum devoted to Empress Elisabeth Amalie Eugenie of Austria) allows visitors to view the Imperial apartments as well as the silver cabinet. Directly opposite the Hofburg are the ''Kunsthistorisches Museum'' and the ''Naturhistorisches Museum'', which houses many paintings by old masters, ancient and classical artifacts.

A number of museums are located in the Technical Museum, the Vienna Clock Museum and the Burial Museum. The museums dedicated to Vienna's districts provide a retrospective of the respective districts.

===Architecture===

: ''Translated from here''
A variety of architectural styles can be found in Vienna, such as the Romanesque Baroque classicist buildings to Secession, Karlsplatz Stadtbahn Station, and the Kirche am Steinhof by Otto Wagner rank among the best known examples of Art Nouveau in the world.

The Wotrubakirche by sculptor Fritz Wotruba. 

In the 1990s, a number of quarters were adapted and extensive building projects were implemented in the areas around Donaustadt (north of the Danube) and Wienerberg (in southern Vienna). The 202&nbsp;m-high Millennium Tower located at Handelskai is the highest building in Vienna.<ref>[http://www.skyscraperpicture.com/vienna.htm Vienna's 10 tallest skyscrapers]</ref><ref>[http://emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=millenniumtower-vienna-austria Millennium Tower] - Emporis</ref> In recent years, Vienna has seen numerous architecture projects completed which combine modern architectural elements with old buildings, such as the remodelling and revitalisation of the old Gasometer in 2001.

Most buildings in Vienna are relatively low; in early 2006 there were around 100 buildings higher than 40&nbsp;m. The number of high-rise buildings is kept low by building legislation aimed at preserving green areas and districts designated as world cultural heritage. Strong rules apply to the planning, authorisation and construction of high-rise buildings. Consequently, much of the inner city is a high-rise free zone.

===Vienna Balls===

Vienna is the last great capital of the nineteenth century ball. There are over 200 significant balls per year, some featuring as many as nine live orchestras. Balls are held in the many beautiful palaces in Vienna, with the principal venue being the Hofburg Palace at Heldenplatz. While the Opera Ball is the best known internationally of all the Austrian balls, other balls such as the Kaffeesiederball (Cafe Owners Ball), the Jägerball (Hunter's Ball) and the Rudolfina Redoute are almost as well known within Austria and even better appreciated for their cordial atmosphere. Most Viennese of even middle class visit at least a few balls in their lifetime. For many, the ball season lasts three months and can include up to ten or fifteen separate appearances.

Dancers and opera singers from the Vienna Staatsoper often perform at the openings of the larger balls.

A Vienna ball is an all night cultural attraction. Major Viennese balls generally begin at nine pm and last until five am, although many guests carry on the celebrations into the next day.

==Education==
Vienna is also Austria's main centre of education and home to many universities, professional gymnasiums.

==Transportation==
Twelve bridges cross the Danube in the city, which is divided by the Danube and its branch, the Neue Donau ("new Danube").

===Public transportation===

Vienna has a large public transportation network.
* Vienna S-Bahn
* Vienna U-Bahn
* Local Railways (Lokalbahn Wien-Baden)
* U-Bahn, bus routes)

Vienna has an extensive tram and bus network - the tram network being third largest in the world. In the most populated areas of Vienna, public transport runs so frequently (even during off-peak hours) that any familiarity with departure timetables is virtually unnecessary. The convenience and flexibility of the public transport is in turn reflected by its popularity; 53% of Viennese workers travel to their workplace by public transport.<ref>Der Standard, Tuesday 27th March 2007</ref> During night hours, public transport is continued by the ''Nightline'' buses operating on all the main routes, generally every half hour.

Fare prices within the city are independent of the length of the journey and covers all modes of public transport. Tickets are also available for various time periods, such as 24 hour, monthly or yearly tickets.

The Viennese public transport services are incorporated into a larger concentric system of transport zones, the VOR (Verkehrsverbund Ostregion = eastern region transport association). VOR includes railway and bus lines operating 50 kilometers into the surrounding areas, and ticket prices are calculated according to the number of zones crossed, Vienna being a single zone. Tickets must be purchased (and usually punched ) prior to boarding or entering a station. Tickets are not routinely checked when entering a station or boarding, but there are surprise inspections  on all routes. 

There are also two miniature railways: the Liliputbahn in the Wiener Prater and the Donauparkbahn in the Donaupark. They are for amusement purposes and have no practical importance as a means of public transport.

===Railways===
thumb|[[Westbahnhof, Vienna|Wien Westbahnhof, the starting point of the Austrian Western Railway.]]

Historically, all transport was oriented towards the main cities in the monarchy. Vienna has several train stations that form the beginning of several train lines:

* Wien Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof, the starting point of the Franz Josef Railway
* Wien Westbahnhof, starting point of the Western Railway
* Wien Südbahnhof (Former South and East Station) for the Southern Railway and the Eastern Railway

There are also several through train stations:
* Wien Hütteldorf on the Western Railway
* Wien Heiligenstadt on the Franz Josef Railway
* Wien Praterstern (Formerly known as Wien Nord or Wien Nord-Praterstern) on the Northern Railway.
* Wien Meidling (Philadelphiabrücke) on the Southern Railway. This is Vienna's most frequented transit station.
* Wien Mitte (Landstraße) on the S-Bahn Stammstrecke ("main line") is the nearest railway station to the centre of Vienna.

There are also a large number of smaller stations that are important for local passenger traffic. Since the mid 1990s, the Westbahnhof and Südbahnhof have handled all long-distance travel. Many trains also stop at Hütteldorf or Meidling, especially when inbound.

In order to bundle all long-distance traffic it has become necessary to build a tunnel, colloquially known as the Wildschweintunnel ("boar tunnel"), underneath Lainzer Tiergarten linking the Western Railway to the Southern Railway. The new bundled train line will connect to a new through train station called Wien Zentralbahnhof that will be constructed instead of the Südbahnhof.

===Road traffic===

Similar to the train lines, ''Bundesstraßen'' leave the city in a star-shaped pattern. Some are named after their historical final destination (Prager Straße to U.S. Highways in the United States, being two-lane in rural areas and multi-lane in urban areas........

Four national A1), northwesterly (A22), southerly (A2), and easterly directions (A4). Similar to the rail lines, they are commonly referred to after their exit direction (Westautobahn, Südautobahn, and Ostautobahn). In addition, several spur and branch autobahns circle around the southern and eastern areas of the city. The protected Wienerwald forest area in the western and northern areas has been left mostly untouched.

===Air traffic===
Vienna International Airport is located to the southeast of Vienna. The airport handled over 254,000 arrivals and departures in 2007 and was frequented by 18.77 million passengers.<ref>{{cite press release

The airport is currently undergoing a major expansion, including a new terminal building and office park, to prepare for an expected increase in passengers.

===Water transportation===
: ''To be translated from here''
Vienna is connected to Industrial areas via the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal, and to Eastern European countries along the Danube to the Black Sea. The planned Danube-Oder-Canal remains unfinished.
