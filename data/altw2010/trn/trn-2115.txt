'''Chateauguay, Quebec''' is an off-island suburb of Montreal, located both on the Lac St-Louis, which is a section of the St. Lawrence River. As of the 2005 census, the total population of Chateauguay was 41,023. 

The city's local newspapers are the ''Le Soleil'' (''The Sun'') and ''L'information''. As of 1999, the current mayor of Chateauguay is Sergio Pavone. He has since then been reelected in both 2003 and 2005. 

==History==

The land was first given to Charles Lemoyne by the governor of seigneurie in the area. Afterwards the seigneurie was assumed by Zacharie Robutel de la Noue in 1706. In 1763 France relinqueshed its claims in Lower Canada and Châteauguay was now under British mandate. The seigneurie was bought by Marguerite d'Youville, a founder of the Québec religious society Soeurs Grises in 1765 and 10 years later construction began on the Church of Saint-Joachim.

Châteauguay plays an important part in the colonial history of North Ameirca. With the United States having declared war on Britain in 1812, Châteauguay was seen as little more than a good vantage point to post troops to defend Montreal against an invasion. This prong of the American advance on Montreal ended with the Mohawk allies. The second American incursion towards Montreal was defeated shortly after at Crysler's Farm on November 11.

During the Lower Canada Rebellion, Châteauguay  was taken by the British army, who carried out the arrests of dozens of French-Canadians, including the leader of the rebels, François-Maurice Lepailleur, who was later exiled to Australia. Two natives of Châteauguay, Joseph Duquet and another sympathiser were later hanged at the prison at Au-pied-du-courant.

The actual village of Châteauguay was created in 1855, after the abolition of the seigneurie system in Quebec by the British colonial regime. Later on the city annexed two neighboring districts, Châteauguay-Heights (1968) and Châteauguay-Centre (1975). In 1982, with the passage of the  [http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file=/A_19_1/A19_1.html| Loi sur l'aménagement et l'urbanisme], Québec, the city became part of the Roussillon Regional County Municipality.

==Services==
*Public Security The Chateauguay Police are comprised of more than eighty officers. Their duties include investigations, crime prevention and routine city patrols. The force also participates in many community efforts. The majority of these outreach programs are aimed at Chateauguay youth and focus on the prevention of drug and alcohol use. The force, originally having only jurisdiction within the city limits expanded its jurisidction over the nearby cities of Lery, Mercier, Beauharnois and Saint-Isidore between 2002 and 2007 through agreements between the municipalities. 

*CITSO (Conseil Intermunicipal de Transport du Sud-Ouest).  They run two Chateauguay-Angrignon loop bus routes circulating in opposite directions.  A city minibus transfers commuters from the western part of the suburb to the downtown, where the other off-peak routes pass.  During rush hours, more bus routes connect the various neighbourhoods with the Angrignon bus terminal and metro station.  A special express bus route connects western Chateauguay and the Chateauguay Highway 138 eastbound makes the connection significantly faster when the taxi funded by CITSO to drop them off at specific points in the city usually within walking distance of their residence. This service has proven itself quite useful and popular amongst those residents who utilize it.
