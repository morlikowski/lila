'''Keith Hernandez''' (nicknamed "'''Mex'''") (born 1974-1983), 1983-1989), and 1990). He batted and threw left-handed, and through most of his career was listed as being 6 feet tall (1.83m) and 195 pounds (88.5kg).

Hernandez was a star athlete at Terra Nova High School before transferring to Capuchino High School, from which he graduated.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20070822/ai_n19475875 Royals' coach McClure pride of County baseball], ''Oakland Tribune'', August 22, 2007. "McClure and Hernandez played together at Terra Nova High before Hernandez transferred to Capuchino."</ref>  He went on to the College of San Mateo (also known as San Mateo Junior College). 

After retiring, Hernandez enjoyed renewed fame by appearing as himself on the "The Boyfriend" and being involved with the episode's plot. He also made an appearance in the episode "The Finale" at the gang's trial. He is now a baseball analyst working for the Mets on SportsNet New York and WPIX television broadcasts.

==Professional career==
===St. Louis Cardinals===
Hernandez was drafted by the Cardinals in the 42nd round of the 1971 draft, as the 776th overall player.  He was perceived to be a character risk because he sat out his entire senior year of high school due to a dispute with a coach. <ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=crasnick_jerry&id=2894316 ESPN - From unknown to very well-known - MLB<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>   
He quickly rose to the upper echelon in the League. In 1979, he led the league with a .344 batting average, 48 doubles, and 116 runs scored, and went on to share the National League's Most Valuable Player Award with Willie Stargell.

In 1982, the Cardinals won the World Series, defeating the Milwaukee Brewers  in seven games. In Game 6, Hernandez and Cardinal catcher Darrell Porter  hit home runs in a 13-1 St. Louis victory.  Hernandez also contributed a very impressive eight runs batted in during the 4 games to 3 World Series victory for the "Redbirds". 

===Trade to the New York Mets===
After multiple disagreements with Cardinal management, most notably including manager 1983. The Cardinals received pitchers Jack Clark and won two more pennants in the next four years. With the Mets, Hernandez was determined to prove Herzog wrong, helping to fuel a rivalry between the two teams in the mid-1980s.

===Pittsburgh drug trials===
In 1985, Hernandez's cocaine use, which had been the subject of persistent rumors and the chief source of friction between Hernandez and Herzog, became a matter of public record as a result of the Pittsburgh trial of drug dealer Curtis Strong. Hernandez made a successful recovery.

===Uniform numbers===
Hernandez wore uniform number 18 for the first two years of his career. In 1976, he switched to number 37, insisting that his uniform number end with a "7" in honor of Mickey Mantle. The Mets had retired number 37 for former manager Casey Stengel, so Hernandez switched to number 17, which he wore for the remainder of his career.

===Success in New York===
In 1984, his first full season with the team, the Mets improved from a record of 68-94 to 90-72. The Mets finished second behind the 1985, but won the World Series in 1986 with 108-54 team record. The following season, Hernandez was named the first team captain in franchise history. Hernandez finished 2nd in the NL Most Valuable Player voting in 1984 (behind the Cubs' Ryne Sandberg), 8th in 1985, and on the Mets' World Series team in 1986, he finished 4th.

===Decline===
Hernandez was often compared to 1988, at the age of just 34, Hernandez began a sharp decline, and the Mets chose not to re-sign him after his contract ran out at the close of the 1989 season.

On 1989, the 1990 season. Hernandez retired after the season.

===Hall of Fame candidacy===
Hernandez never received enough support from the 2004, after nine years on the ballot, he received votes from fewer than 5% of the writers, thus ending his  eligibility. Hernandez may still be considered for induction by the Veterans Committee in 2011, twenty years after his retirement. 

===Defensive skills===
Hernandez may have been the best defensive first baseman in MLB history.  Hernandez had such a strong and accurate throwing arm that, as a result, the Mets re-routed their relays through him.  Due to his quick instincts, Hernandez was also able to play farther off first base than other first basemen, allowing the other infielders to play farther to their right.

He was the most aggressive first baseman, occasionally discouraging opponents to bunt merely by reputation. Bill Russell," and Jim Frey, the Chicago Cubs manager, said he wouldn't ask most pitchers to bunt against the Mets. "You're just asking for a forceout at second, and now you've got your pitcher running the bases," he said.

Astros manager Hal Lanier said the combination of Hernandez at first and any one of three Mets pitchers -- Ron Darling, Roger McDowell or Jesse Orosco -- made bunting against the Mets "near impossible."

Hernandez also revolutionized the position -- until umpires disallowed what he did -- by taking pickoff throws while essentially squatting in foul territory so that he could make tags to his right more readily.  (Positioning oneself in foul territory is now illegal, according to official baseball rules, which state that all defensive players except the catcher must be positioned in fair territory while the ball is pitched.)

===Achievements===
* Won 11 consecutive Gold Glove Awards (1978-1988) at first base (the largest total by any first baseman).
* Won the 1979 National League MVP award along with Willie Stargell. 
* Holds the career record for game winning RBIs, a statistic that was only official from 1980-1988. His career record is 129. The season record (also by Hernandez) is 24, set in 1985. 
* Batted over .300 seven times in his career.
* Was a member of two World Series Championship teams (1982 Cardinals, 1986 Mets).  
* Was selected to the All-Star Game five times (1979, 1980, 1984, 1986 as a starter, and 1987).
* Was the National League first base in 1980 and 1984. 
* Led the National League in runs scored (1979 and 1980), doubles (1979), on-base percentage (1980) and walks (1986).
* Inducted into the 1997.
* Voted Mets' all-time first baseman by fans in celebration of the team's 40th anniversary in 2002.
* Voted best mustache of all New York Mets<ref>http://baseball-fever.com/showthread.php?t=66678&highlight=mustache</ref>

'''キース・ヘルナンデス'''（'''Keith Hernandez ''' , アメリカ・メジャーリーグで活躍した元野球選手。内野手（一塁手）。左投左打。アメリカ合衆国カリフォルニア州サンフランシスコ出身。

== 人物・来歴 ==
メジャードラフト会議でセントルイス・カージナルスから42巡目（全米776位）と、後の実績を思えば非常に低い評価で指名され、入団。
1974年8月30日にメジャーデビューを果たし、3年目の1976年には持ち前の巧打と好守備で一塁のレギュラーを獲得。

首位打者を獲得。11本塁打、105打点の成績を残し、この年のナ・リーグMVPに選出された（ピッツバーグ・パイレーツのウィリー・スタージェルと同点で、2人受賞）。
ワールドシリーズに出場し、ア・リーグ所属だった）と戦う。第6戦で本塁打を放ち、チームをワールドシリーズ制覇に導いた。

翌1983年6月15日に、2選手との交換でニューヨーク・メッツにトレードされた。カージナルスの監督ホワイティ・ハーゾグが、年齢的な衰えを懸念して放出したものであったが、メッツにとっては成功したトレードの一つとなった。

1985年、パイレーツの当時の本拠地スリーリバース・スタジアムでの麻薬（コカイン）の密買・使用に関与し、「100時間の奉仕活動と麻薬の抜き打ち検査を受ける」ことを条件に出場停止処分を逃れるが、チーム及びファンから熱烈な支持を受けてその後も活躍。
ワールドシリーズ制覇に貢献した。

1987年からはチームの初代キャプテンに任命され、この年も打率.290、18本塁打89打点の活躍を見せるが、1988年以後は衰えが目立ち、1989年限りでメッツを去り、クリーブランド・インディアンズに移籍。
1990年も43試合の出場にとどまり、この年限りで現役を引退した。

守備力にも優れ、ゴールドグラブ賞を1978年から1988年にかけて11年連続で受賞している。
ヘルナンデスの一塁守備が優れているため、1980年代半ばのシカゴ・カブスの監督ジム・フライ（1984年にカブスを地区優勝に導く）は、「ランナーが二塁でフォースアウトになって、ピッチャーがランナーになるよりはまし」として、メッツとの試合では、投手にあまり送りバントをさせなかったという。

また、1980年から1988年の間にメジャーで公式記録だった勝利打点もその間に129記録しており、これはメジャー最多。1985年の24はシーズン記録である。

==背番号==
ヘルナンデスにとってのヒーローミッキー・マントルの「'''7'''」がついた背番号を望む。
カージナルスでのデビュー当時は「'''18'''」で、1975年までつけたが、76年には「'''37'''」に変更。
83年途中に移籍したメッツでは37が初代監督ケーシー・ステンゲルの永久欠番のため、「'''17'''」をつけた。
