'''Die dreibeinigen Herrscher''' (Originaltitel: '''The Tripods''') ist die Science-Fiction-Buchreihe „Die dreibeinigen Monster“, die von britischen Fernsehanstalt BBC verfilmt.

== Handlung ==
Die Geschichte über die ''dreibeinigen Herrscher'' spielt in einer postapokalyptischen Welt, in der die meisten Menschen ausgelöscht und die größten Städte nur noch verwüstete Ruinen sind. Die Menschen werden von einer außerirdischen Zivilisation beherrscht, die sie nur als ''die Dreibeiner'' bezeichnen, von denen die meisten jedoch nur die gigantischen, dreibeinigen Maschinen zu sehen bekommen, mit denen diese unseren Planeten bereisen. Diese Maschinen erinnern in frappierender Weise an jene, die bereits H. G. Wells in seiner Erzählung ''Krieg der Welten'' beschreibt. Die wenigen überlebenden Menschen, die auf der Erde leben, erhalten von jenen Herrschern im Alter von 14 Jahren eine ''Kappe'' implantiert, die ihnen jegliche Inspiration, Kreativität und damit auch die Möglichkeit zu Revolution und Gewalt nimmt.

In der 1. Staffel (Episode 14) der BBC-Serie wird auch die Theorie erläutert, die Dreibeiner könnten sich aus einer vom Mensch selbst geschaffenen künstlichen Intelligenz entwickelt haben, die irgendwann mit dem "unlogischen Verhalten und der Gewalttätigkeit ihrer menschlichen Schöpfer" unzufrieden war und die Kontrolle über diese übernahm. In den Büchern von Christopher deutet aber nichts auf diese Theorie hin und wird im 4. Band durch die plötzliche Ankunft der Dreibeiner sowie auch in der 2. Staffel der Serie widerlegt.

== Fernsehserie ==
In den 1980er-Jahren wurden die Bücher von der BBC als aufwändige Fernseh-Serie adaptiert. In Deutschland wurde sie unter dem Titel ''Die dreibeinigen Herrscher'' ausgestrahlt.  Die erste Staffel der Serie (Episode 1-13) entspricht in ihrem Umfang dem ersten Buch der Serie (''The White Mountains'', 1967, deutsch ''Dreibeinige Monster auf Erdkurs''), so wie die zweite Staffel (Episode 14-25) dem zweiten Buch entspricht (''The City of Gold and Lead'', 1967, deutsch ''Das Geheimnis der dreibeinigen Monster''). Das Projekt wurde vor der Realisierung der dritten Staffel abgebrochen. Die Serie hatte sich als zu aufwändig und kostspielig herausgestellt.

In Deutschland wurden die ersten zwölf Folgen der Serie erstmalig ab dem 6. April 1986 vom ZDF ausgestrahlt. Im Jahr 1988 sendete das ZDF letztlich die gesamte Serie: die Folgen 1–19 vom 7. Januar bis 19. Mai und die Folgen 20–25 vom 30. August bis 4. Oktober. Eine weitere Ausstrahlung erfolgte nicht.

'''''The Tripods''''' is series of science fiction TV-series, produced in the UK in the 1980s (it was aired between September 1984 and December 1985).

The story of ''The Tripods'' is post-apocalyptic. Humanity has been conquered and enslaved by "the tripods", unseen alien entities who travel about in gigantic three-legged walking machines (the unsophisticated humans believe the walking machines themselves to be their living overlords). Human society is largely pastoral, with few habitations larger than villages, and what little industry exists is conducted under the watchful presence of the tripods.  Lifestyle is reminiscent of the Middle Ages, but artifacts from previous ages are still used, giving individuals and homes a rather anachronistic appearance.
 
Humans are controlled from the age of 14 by cranial implants called "caps", which suppress curiosity and creativity and leave the recipient placid and docile, incapable of dissent.  The caps cause them to adore the tripods as their saviours. Some people whose minds are crushed under the pressure of the Cap's hypnotic power become vagrants who wander the countryside shouting nonsense.

Disney has owned the rights to ''The Tripods'' since 1997. It has been reported that a cinematic version is in pre-production with Australian-born director Gregor Jordan signed on to rewrite and direct for Walt Disney's Touchstone Pictures label.<ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117915772?categoryid=13&cs=1 Jordan to control 'Tripods Trilogy' - Entertainment News, Film News, Media - Variety<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Books==
=== ''When the Tripods Came'' (1988) ===
''When the Tripods Came'' is a prequel written twenty years after the publication of the original "trilogy", and set in the late twentieth century. It was written, allegedly, because science fiction author Brian Aldiss questioned the story of ''The Masters'' being able to overcome 20th century technology.

In the second book of the main trilogy, one of the Masters tells the main character about the Masters' conquest of the Earth. The plot of the book follows the description of the conquest previously given. We learn that the Masters were afraid of the technological potential of Humanity and decided on a pre-emptive strike. Unable to defeat Humanity in a conventional war, the Masters use their superior mind-control technology to hypnotise part of Humanity through a television show called The Trippy Show, and then use the caps to control them permanently when they eventually land. The tripods then cap other people until the capped are in control in most places.

Like the narrator of the original trilogy, the narrator of ''When the Tripods Came'' is a young English boy. As society slowly falls under the control of the Masters, he and his family escape to Switzerland, which adopted an isolationist stance to hold out against the initial invasion. Eventually it is invaded by France and Germany, who have fallen under the subjugation of the Masters, and the narrator is forced to flee into the Alps with his family as the Swiss are also enslaved by the Masters. Here, they establish the "White Mountains" resistance movement that features heavily in the original trilogy, and the book ends on a hopeful note.

''The Tripods'' trilogy can be read and understood without any need to have read the prequel.

===''The White Mountains'' (1967)===
The story begins in a small village in England, roughly a century after the Tripods arrived and conquered Earth. Will, the narrator, is 13 not quite a year short of the time when he will be "capped". His cousin, Henry, is of a similar age, but one month younger than Will. Although neither understands how the Caps work, they know that the Capped are unquestioning and uncreative. Feeling uncomfortable with the idea of losing their creativity, the two follow the advice of a mysterious vagrant who goes by the name of "Ozymandias" and undertake a long journey to the "White Mountains" (actually the Swiss Alps, literally translated from the French Mont Blanc). After crossing the English Channel, they join forces with a young, inventive French boy, Jean-Paul (Henry Anglicizes his name to Beanpole, owing to his tall, thin stature, and he is so referenced for the rest of the series), and head for the White Mountains. The boys go through the remains of Paris, abandoned and ravaged by some ancient war, and finally arrive at the General Quarters of the human resistance, having while en route, and mostly by sheer luck, destroyed a Tripod with old hand grenades they had recovered from the ruins of Paris. 

While written for a young audience--being rather short (under two hundred pages) and having an unsophisticated vocabulary--the book is swiftly plotted and filled with narrow escapes, except for a brief period during which the boys live at a manor owned by a wealthy French count. Will forms a strong relationship with their preteen daughter, Eloïse, and is heartbroken when Eloïse is chosen "queen of the tournament" at an athletic competition that the count hosts for knights living in the surrounding countryside, for Eloïse must then go off to serve the Tripods in their domed city. (The Tripods, it turns out, actually have three cities: one in Germany, one on the Chinese coast, and one on the Panama Canal.)

===''The City of Gold and Lead'' (1967)===
It's been a year since Will, Henry, and Beanpole arrived at the White Mountains. The Resistance now charges Will, Beanpole and a young German boy, Fritz, to infiltrate a Tripod city by competing in a sporting exhibition called the Games (very similar in nature to the Summer Olympics) in which the winners of the events are to be offered to the Tripods for service. Will, a boxer, and Fritz, a runner, win their respective contests, while Beanpole is unsuccessful in the jumping events. Will, Fritz, and the other winners are taken by Tripods, which they discover to be machines operated by living creatures, to the Tripod city, which is located in a sealed, pressurized dome that sits astride a river (apparently a tributary of the river Masters), three-legged, three-eyed, three-tentacled creatures from a planet that has a stronger gravitational field and a hotter ambient temperature. The Masters breathe a greenish gas toxic to humans. Conditions on the Masters' world are re-created inside the city. The humans in the City are treated as slaves and pets-- being given their own airlocked rooms in which they can live (though not very comfortably) without gas masks when their Masters do not require their services.  

Since the Masters are unaware that Will and Fritz are false-capped, they don't consider the possibility of hostile behaviour. Thus, the boys are able to spy unobtrusively on a significant portion of the city. In addition, Will's master develops a special fondness for him that causes the master occasionally to reveal details of the Masters and their civilization.  Will thereby learns that the stakes of the mission are much higher than anyone had foreseen: the Masters have initiated a project to replace the Earth's atmosphere with their own in preparation for the colonization of the planet, which will obliterate humanity and much other Earth life in the process. The spaceship which carries the processing equipment is already on its way, and is due in four years.

Will compiles a journal of his observations and findings for the benefit of the resistance group. His Master ultimately discovers the journal, and in desperation, Will attacks and kills his Master, accelerating the boys' escape plans. Will and Fritz find an opening in the golden wall through which water runs. Will escapes but Fritz stays, arguing that it would look suspicious if two slaves suddenly went missing. Will is saved by Beanpole, who was living outside the city waiting for his friends' escape. Will and Beanpole wait for Fritz to come out of the city, but many days of vain waiting and the coming of winter cause them to head back to the White Mountains.

The title of the book refers to the great gold coloured wall surrounding the Masters' city, and to Will's comment that increased gravity inside the city made him feel as though his body had become as heavy as lead.

=== ''The Pool of Fire'' (1968) ===
Will returns to the headquarters of the Resistance after several months in the City of Gold and Lead, where he and Fritz (having escaped the city and finding his way back to the Resistance) travel to the Middle East and set up resistance cells with young boys who question the power of the Tripods. The resistance then ambushes a soporific effect on the Masters, the Resistance schedules simultaneous commando attacks on the cities. Will is one of the leaders of the attack on the European city.

By introducing alcohol into the city water system, the raiding party is able to incapacitate all of the Masters and ultimately to destroy the integrity of the city's sealed environment, killing all the Masters. The attack on the second city, in eastern Asia, is likewise successful, but the attack on the last city, in Panama, is not. After aerial bombing attempts fail&#151;because the Masters can disable motors from a distance&#151;the third city is eventually destroyed in an attack launched from air balloons, albeit only after Henry turns it into his own suicide bombing.

The world is liberated from the Masters' thought control and technology is rediscovered rapidly. The Masters' spaceship finally arrives, only to launch nuclear devices which destroy the remains of the cities, presumably to prevent the humans from reverse engineering the Masters' technology and using it to launch a retaliatory expedition against them. Humanity is saved, but the saga ends with a renewal of nationalist sentiments. The reader is invited by Will's musings to wonder: having mastered the Masters, can people master themselves? Will, Beanpole and Fritz decide to band together to help unite the people again.
