The '''International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program (DP)''' is an English, French or Spanish) and is a leading schools, often in international schools, in 125 countries all around the world (as of 2007).  More than half of the schools offering the Diploma Program are state funded schools. The program, administered by the International Baccalaureate Organization, is the most widely recognized pre-university educational program. 

== Curriculum ==

left|thumb|center|IB Hexagon Model

The Diploma Program (DP) curriculum consists of six subjects (see below), an Theory of Knowledge (ToK), and a requirement of at least 50 hours in each area of CAS (Creative, Action, Service).  Marks are awarded from 1 to 7 in each subject with 7 being the highest, and up to three additional points may be awarded depending on the results of the EE and ToK essays. The maximum possible point total in the Diploma Program is 45. In order to receive an International Baccalaureate Diploma candidates must receive a minimum of 24 points. There are a number of failing conditions which will prevent a student from being awarded a Diploma regardless of the points they received (such as non-completion of CAS, plagiarism, no EE etc).

Candidates that successfully pass examinations in two language A1 , or one language A1 and one language A2 courses and meet all the other criteria for successful completion of the Diploma Program are eligible to receive a Bilingual Diploma. 

Students may also take a limited number of subjects or opt out of some activities (such as ToK). These students do not receive the Diploma, but instead receive certificates for each subject passed. 

=== Subject areas ===
Students that pursue the diploma take six subjects; one each from Groups 1 - 5 (below) with an additional subject from 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6.
A minimum of  three subjects must be taken at higher level (HL) and the rest at standard level (SL). There must be no more than 4 subjects taken at a Higher Level. Higher level subjects require approximately 240 hours of teaching time, and standard level subjects about 150.

*'''Group 1: Language A1''' - Generally the student's strongest language, with over 80 different languages available.  Students may choose to self-study a language of their choice at standard level if their fluent language is not taught by the school.
*'''Group 2: Second Language''' - An additional language, taken either at A2 (HL or SL), B (SL or HL) or ''ab initio'' (SL only). This group may also be replaced by a second A1 language.
*'''Group 3: Individuals and Societies''' - Humanities and social sciences, such as thumb|right|300px|The components of the IB Diploma course-->
*'''Group 4: Experimental Sciences''' - Subjects such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, New Zealand and Turkey, students are allowed to choose three subjects from this group and none from Group 3, as it is required for admission into some universities. 
*'''Group 5: Mathematics''' - The subjects are, in order of increasing difficulty, Mathematical Studies SL, Mathematics SL, and Mathematics HL. Furthermore, Further Mathematics can be studied at SL in addition to a Mathematics HL course. This group also includes computer science but only as an elective (not a substitute for the other mathematics courses).
*'''Group 6: Arts and Electives''' - Subjects such as visual arts, film, music, dance, and theatre arts. Can be replaced with another class from Group 2, 3, or 4, or Computer Science from Group 5.

=== Extended Essay ===

Students must write an essay of up to 4,000 words in any chosen subject (not necessarily one taken for the final exam, although it is highly suggested that the student have some familiarity with the topic) but not across subjects. All subjects have specific guidelines that must be followed in order for the Extended Essay to be considered.  The topic may be any that the student feels  is researchable. This task involves teacher guided independent research and requires producing a written thesis. Each student is paired with a supervisor who provides insight and orients his or her work.  The Extended Essay ''must'' be submitted in order to receive the IB Diploma.

=== CAS ===

CAS is the acronym for ''Creativity, Action, Service''. This extracurricular aspect of the IB Diploma involves student engagement in social work or community service (Service), participation in sports (Action), and initiative in creative activity (Creativity). The purpose of CAS is to encourage students to go beyond academic pursuits and experience life outside school. Each Diploma candidate completes 150 hours of CAS related activities over the period of the IB course, where 50 hours each are contributed towards Creativity, Service and Action. Students may increase and decrease hours in the three categories provided no category exceeds 70 hours, no category has less than 40 hours and the student still reaches 150 hours.The hours of work completed are documented by the school using official forms (CAS/AEF Forms) which are submitted to the IBO by January of the final year of the IB course. The IB Diploma is awarded only upon successful completion of CAS.

=== Theory of Knowledge ===

Each student must complete the ''Theory of Knowledge'' (TOK) course of at least 100 hours, which aims to encourage students to be critical thinkers and to teach students basic epistemology. To complete requirements for TOK, diploma candidates must write a TOK essay of 1200-1600 words on a set title (from a choice of ten issued by the IBO), and present a TOK issue to their class on their choice of topic.

The grades that the student receives from the TOK essay and presentation are compared with the grade for the Extended Essay by way of a matrix designed by the IBO, which may result in the awarding of 'extra' points for the candidate's Diploma. The candidate may get up to three extra points if both works are of a sufficient standard.

=== Assessment ===
All subjects are assessed using both internal and external assessment, including final exams given worldwide in May (usually for Northern Hemisphere schools) and in November (usually for Southern Hemisphere schools). Each exam usually consists of two or three ''papers'', generally written on the same or successive days <ref>http://www.ibo.org/students/documents/MayandNovember2008examinationschedulesEnglish.pdf 2008 IBO Examination Schedule </ref>. The different papers may have different forms of questions, or they may focus on different areas of the subject syllabus. For example, chemistry Paper 1 has multiple choice questions, Paper 2 has extended response questions, and Paper 3 focuses on the 'option' topics which can vary according to the student's (or school's) preference. Re-sits for each paper (sat in the next exam session - November or May) are possible for a maximum of three times.

Each individual paper can take anywhere from 45 minutes to three hours, but usually they are between one and two hours in duration. Because of the large number of subjects being examined in one examination session (of less than a month in length), students often must write multiple papers in one day. The external assessment is judged by examiners appointed by the IBO.

The nature of the internal assessment (IA) varies by subject. There may be oral presentations (used in languages), practical work (in experimental sciences), or written works to be done at home. Internal assessment accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the mark awarded for each subject and is marked by a teacher in the school. A sample of at least five per subject at each level will also be graded by a moderator appointed by the IBO, in a process called external moderation of internal assessment.

The marks collected from the internal and external moderators are again standardized annually on a world-wide scale. The results from each year determine the grade-boundaries of that year. Therefore, the effect of variation in difficulty of exams is taken into account.

== Awards ==
There are two types of award available in the IB Diploma Program. A student can be awarded the full Diploma or Certificates of Merit in individual subjects. The usual pass rate for the IB Diploma Program is approximately 80% internationally.<ref>http://www.ibo.org/facts/21things/documents/21thingsyoushouldknowabouttheIBMarch08.pdf</ref>

=== Diploma conditions ===
In order to be awarded the full IB Diploma the following requirements must have been met:
* at least three subjects are completed at Higher Level (HL) and three at Standard Level (SL).
** should four subjects be completed at HL then only two need be completed at SL.
* all six subjects have been awarded a numerical grade higher than 1, with a minimum total score of 24.
* the CAS (Creativity - Action - Service; community service) requirement of 150 hours has been completed
* the Extended Essay and TOK course have been completed and essays submitted.
** additionally a grade D or better has been awarded in either the Extended Essay or TOK.
* if the overall score is 24-27, there is no grade 2 at HL and not more than one grade 2 at SL; if the overall score is greater than or equal to 28, not more than one grade 2 at HL and no more than two grades 2 at SL; altogether, there are no more than three grades 3 or below
* at least 12 points (12 for overall score 24-27; 16 if four HL subjects are taken) have been gained on HL subjects, and 9/8 (6/5 if only two SL subjects are taken) on SL subjects
* the final award committee has not judged the candidate to be guilty of malpractice

=== Certificates ===
A candidate may also choose not to take the whole Diploma, but to aim for a Certificate in a particular subject. Candidates doing certificates do not have to take part in the extra requirements of the Diploma (the Extended Essay, TOK and CAS). However, if taking World History (social studies certificate), the student is required to complete the Theory of Knowledge. Those candidates who complete extra courses in addition to a Diploma will also receive a Certificate.

== Recognition==

<!-- Deleted image removed: thumb|right|IB World School logo. -->

In '''Canada''' and the '''United States''', some IBDP courses are recognised as equivalent to university/college-level courses, and universities and colleges may award entering students with first-year credit depending on their points totals. In this regard it is similar to the Advanced Placement Program.

In the '''Oxford and Cambridge, accept the IB Diploma as an alternative to A-levels and Scottish Highers.  UCAS has created a tariff for IB points which will be in use from 2008 university entry onwards.

In some countries, such as '''Turkey''' or '''Peru''', the IB Diploma is not considered equivalent to the national end-of-school examination scheme, usually because the IB Diploma is not as specialised, or because certain subjects are not offered. However, in Peru, various universities allow direct entrance to students who successfully completed the IB.

'''国際バカロレア資格'''（こくさいバカロレアしかく ）とは、スイスの財団法人 国際バカロレア機構（Organisation du Baccalaureat International）の定める教育課程を修了すると得られる資格である。

初等・中等・高等の教育課程それぞれについて一定の履修基準があり、課程修了時に修了試験を受ける。英語、フランス語、スペイン語を公式教授言語として定めている。教育言語だけでなく生徒の母語の履修が必修である点で、国家が実施する教育課程とは異なる。たとえばアメリカン・スクールでは日本語は日本語を第一言語とする生徒にとって必修科目ではないが、他にも母語に相当する言語がない場合、国際バカロレアでは原則として必修科目となる。
