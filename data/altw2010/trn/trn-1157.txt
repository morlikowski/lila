In Olive, Orange, Villa Park, Santa Ana, Tustin, Costa Mesa and Newport Beach stand today.

After the Mexican-American war in 1848, Alta California became part of the United States in 1850 and American settlers arrived in this area.

Villa Park was not incorporated until 1962, but it was known in 1860's as Mountain View. Villa Park came into usage when the post office was founded and the name Mountain View was already taken by a city in Northern California. 

Villa Park was, for many years, an agricultural area producing, in turn, Orange. 

These ranchers established the Orange, although the packing house that was the dominant Villa Park landmark for many years, located west of the shopping center, was torn down in 1983. The citrus groves have yielded to the developers, but these pioneers have left an enduring legacy in half-acre zoning for housing, which has been instrumental in shaping the city's character.
