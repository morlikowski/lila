'''Biochemistry''' is the study of the chemical processes in living organisms. It deals with the structure and function of cellular components, such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules.

Although there are a vast number of different biomolecules, many are complex and large molecules (called ''catalyzed reactions.

The biochemistry of cell transport, and signal transduction.

This article only discusses terrestrial biochemistry (common ancestor, they have similar biochemistries, even for matters that seem to be essentially arbitrary, such as handedness of various biomolecules. It is unknown whether alternative biochemistries are possible or practical.

== History==

thumb|right|150px|Friedrich Wöhler
Originally, it was generally believed that life was not subject to the laws of science the way non-life was. It was thought that only living beings could produce the molecules of life (from other, previously existing biomolecules). Then, in 1828, organic compounds can be created artificially.<ref></ref><ref></ref> 

The dawn of biochemistry may have been the discovery of the first enzyme, alcoholic fermentation in cell extracts of yeast. Although the term “biochemistry” seems to have been first used in 1882, it is generally accepted that the formal coinage of biochemistry occurred in 1903 by NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy and cell, such as glycolysis and the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle). 

Another significant historic event in biochemistry is the discovery of the gene and its role in the transfer of information in the cell. This part of biochemistry is often called molecular biology. In the 1950s, James D. Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkins were instrumental in solving DNA structure and suggesting its relationship with genetic transfer of information. In 1958, George Beadle and Edward Tatum received the Nobel Prize for work in fungi showing that one gene produces one enzyme. In 1988, Colin Pitchfork was the first person convicted of murder with DNA evidence, which led to growth of forensic science. More recently, Andrew Z. Fire and Craig C. Mello received the 2006 Nobel Prize for discovering the role of RNA interference (RNAi), in the silencing of gene expression. 

Today, there are three main types of biochemistry as established by Michael E. Sugar. Plant biochemistry involves the study of the biochemistry of autotrophic organisms such as photosynthesis and other plant specific biochemical processes. General biochemistry encompasses both plant and animal biochemistry. Human/medical/medicinal biochemistry focuses on the biochemistry of humans and medical illnesses.

==Monomers and Polymers==

Monomers and polymers are a structural basis in which the four main macromolecules <sup>(Carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids)</sup>, or biopolymers, of biochemistry are based on.  '''''Monomers''''' are smaller micromolecules that are put together to make macromolecules.  '''''Polymers''''' are those macromolecules that are created when monomers are synthesized together.  When they are synthesized, the two molecules undergo a process called dehydration synthesis.

===Carbohydrates===

Carbohydrates have monomers called oxygen atom are lost from the two monosaccharides' carboxyl group.

===Lipids===

Lipids are usually made up of a molecule of glycerol and other molecules.  In triglycerides, or the main lipid, there is one molecule of glycerol, and three fatty acids.  Fatty acids are considered the monomer in that case, and could be saturated or unsaturated.

===Proteins===

'''''polypeptide''''', or a protein.

===Nucleic Acids===

Nucleic acids are very important in biochemistry.  The most common nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid.  Their monomers are called nucleotides.  The most common nucleotides are called adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil.  Adenine binds with thymine and uracil, thymine only binds with adenine, and cytosine and guanine can only bind with each other.

==Carbohydrates==

The function of carbohydrates includes energy storage and providing structure. Sugars are carbohydrates, but not all carbohydrates are sugars. There are more carbohydrates on Earth than any other known type of biomolecule. 

===Monosaccharides===
thumb|[[Glucose]]
The simplest type of carbohydrate is a condensation to oligo- and polysaccharides) contain less carbon relative to H and O, which still are present in 2:1 (H:O) ratio. Monosaccharides can be grouped into keto group in their chain; e. g. fructose). Both aldoses and ketoses occur in an equilibrium between the open-chain forms and (starting with chain lengths of C4) cyclic forms. These are generated by bond formation between one of the hydroxyl groups of the sugar chain with the carbon of the aldehyde or keto group to form a hemiacetal bond. This leads to saturated five-membered (in furanoses) or six-membered (in pyranoses) heterocyclic rings containing one O as heteroatom.

===Disaccharides===
thumb|[[Sucrose: ordinary table sugar and probably the most familiar carbohydrate.]]
Two monosaccharides can be joined together using dehydration synthesis, in which a hydrogen atom is removed from the end of one molecule and a hydroxyl group (&mdash;OH) is removed from the other; the remaining residues are then attached at the sites from which the atoms were removed. The H&mdash;OH or H<sub>2</sub>O is then released as a molecule of water, hence the term ''dehydration''. The new molecule, consisting of two monosaccharides, is called a ''disaccharide'' and is conjoined together by a glycosidic or ether bond. The reverse reaction can also occur, using a molecule of water to split up a disaccharide and break the glycosidic bond; this is termed ''hydrolysis''. The most well-known disaccharide is sucrose, ordinary sugar (in scientific contexts, called ''table sugar'' or ''cane sugar'' to differentiate it from other sugars). Sucrose consists of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule joined together. Another important disaccharide is lactose, consisting of a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule. As most humans age, the production of lactase, the enzyme that hydrolyzes lactose back into glucose and galactose, typically decreases. This results in lactase deficiency, also called ''lactose intolerance''. 

Sugar polymers are characterised by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom which can be in equilibrium with the open-chain aldehyde or keto form. If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the pyranose or furanose form is exchanged with an OH-side chain of another sugar, yielding a full acetal. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety form a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. Saccharose does not have a reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).

===Oligosaccharides and polysaccharides===
thumb|[[Cellulose as polymer of β-<small>D</small>-glucose]]
When a few (around three to six) monosaccharides are joined together, it is called an ''oligosaccharide'' (''oligo-'' meaning "few"). These molecules tend to be used as markers and signals, as well as having some other uses.

Many monosaccharides joined together make a polysaccharide. They can be joined together in one long linear chain, or they may be branched. Two of the most common polysaccharides are cellulose and glycogen, both consisting of repeating glucose monomers. 
* ''Cellulose'' is made by plants and is an important structural component of their cell walls. Humans can neither manufacture nor digest it. 
* ''Glycogen'', on the other hand, is an animal carbohydrate; humans and other animals use it as a form of energy storage.

===Use of carbohydrates as an energy source===
:''See also carbohydrate metabolism''
Glucose is the major energy source in most life forms. For instance, polysaccharides are broken down into their monomers (glycogen phosphorylase removes glucose residues from glycogen). Disaccharides like lactose or sucrose are cleaved into their two component monosaccharides. 

====Glycolysis (anaerobic)====
Glucose is mainly metabolized by a very important and ancient ten-step pathway called ATP, the energy currency of cells, along with two reducing equivalents in the form of converting NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH. This does not require oxygen; if no oxygen is available (or the cell cannot use oxygen), the NAD is restored by converting the pyruvate to lactate (lactic acid) (e. g. in humans) or to ethanol plus carbon dioxide (e. g. in yeast). Other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway.

====Aerobic====
In aerobic cells with sufficient oxygen, like most human cells, the pyruvate is further metabolized. It is irreversibly converted to FADH<sub>2</sub> as enzyme-bound cofactor), and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide. The produced NADH and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain, an electron transport system transferring the electrons ultimately to oxygen and conserving the released energy in the form of a proton gradient over a membrane (inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes). Thereby, oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors NAD<sup>+</sup> and quinone are regenerated. This is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. The energy released from transferring the electrons from high-energy states in NADH and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to ATP via ATP synthase. This generates an additional ''28'' molecules of ATP (24 from the 8 NADH + 4 from the 2 quinols), totaling to 32 molecules of ATP conserved per degraded glucose (two from glycolysis + two from the citrate cycle). It is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygen-independent metabolic feature, and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only after Earth's atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen.

====Gluconeogenesis====

In anaerobic metabolism, converting glucose to lactate. The liver regenerates the glucose, using a process called gluconeogenesis. This process is not quite the opposite of glycolysis, and actually requires three times the amount of energy gained from glycolysis (six molecules of ATP are used, compared to the two gained in glycolysis). Analogous to the above reactions, the glucose produced can then undergo glycolysis in tissues that need energy, be stored as glycogen (or starch in plants), or be converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di- or oligosaccharides. The combined pathways of glycolysis during exercise, lactate's crossing via the bloodstream to the liver, subsequent gluconeogenisis and release of glucose into the bloodstream is called the Cori cycle. 

==Proteins==

Like carbohydrates, some proteins perform largely structural roles. For instance, movements of the proteins Antibodies are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule. In fact, the substrates''; they then catalyze the reaction between them. By lowering the activation energy, the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 10<sup>11</sup> or more: a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself is not used up in the process, and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole.

'''Biokemi''' är den vetenskap som studerar de molekyler och kemiska processer som förekommer i levande organiska kemin. 

De livsformer som finns på höger- eller vänstergeometri vid sammanfogning av många molekyltyper. Man vet inte om helt andra biokemiska system skulle vara möjliga. 

Antalet olika molekyler i organismerna är oerhört stort, men de flesta är uppbyggda på ett regelbundet sätt genom sammanfogning av ett stort antal små byggstenar. Biokemin undersöker hur dessa byggstenar är uppbyggda, hur de bildas, och vilka kemiska egenskaper och vilken betydelse för cellen de har.  

En viktig del av biokemin är att studera proteiners egenskaper, i synnerhet hur de fungerar som enzymer. Cellens metabolism och det endokrina systemet har också beskrivits utförligt. Andra delområden i biokemin är den genetiska koden, proteinsyntes, molekyltransport över cellmembran och kemisk signalering mellan celler. 

== Kemiska ämnesgrupper inom biokemin ==
Biokemin studerar hur de olika molekylerna i cellen fungerar. Det handlar till exempel om: 
* Aminosyror som bygger upp proteiner
* Kolhydrater
* Lipider
* Proteiner
* Nukleinsyror
