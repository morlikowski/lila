==Biography==
The son of second-generation immigrant Jewish parents with roots in Lithuania and Turkey, Schama was born in London in February 1945. In the late 1940s, the family moved to Southend-on-Sea in Essex before moving back to London. Schama writes of this period in the Introduction to ''Landscape & Memory'' (pp.3-4): 
<blockquote>
I had no hill [the previous paragraph had talked of his enthusiasm for ''Puck of Pook's Hill''], but I did have the Thames. It was not the upstream river that the poets in my Palgrave claimed burbled betwixt mossy banks. ... It was the low, gull-swept estuary, the marriage bed of salt and fresh water, stretching as far as I could see from my northern Essex bank, toward a thin black horizon on the other side. That would be Kent, the sinister enemy who always seemed to beat us in the County Cricket Championship. ...
</blockquote>
Schama won a Haberdashers' Aske's and went on to Christ's College, Cambridge, reading history under Starred First<ref>The American equivalent would be Summa Cum Laude.</ref> in 1966. 

He worked for short periods as a lecturer in history at Cambridge, where he became a Fellow and Director of Studies in History, and at Oxford where he was made a Fellow of Patriot revolution in aftermath. 

His second book, ''Two Rothschilds and the Land of Israel'' (1978), is a study of the Zionist aims of Edmond James de Rothschild and James Armand de Rothschild.

==In America==
In 1980 Schama accepted a chair at Harvard. His next book, ''The Embarrassment of Riches'' (1987), again focussed on Dutch history. In it, Schama interpreted the ambivalences that informed the Dutch Golden Age of the seventeenth century, held in balance between the conflicting imperatives, to live richly and with power, or to live a godly life. The iconographic evidence that Schama draws upon, in 317 illustrations, of emblems and propaganda that defined Dutch character, prefigured his expansion in the 1990s as a commentator on art and visual culture.<ref>"He provides a reading of cultural tints and social textures," the reviewers in ''Contemporary Sociology'' (vol. 17.6  (November 1988:760-762) found, "at a level of visual detail that is usually reserved for art history."</ref>

''Citizens'' (1989), written at speed to a publisher's commission, finally saw the publication of his long-awaited study of the French revolution, and won the 1990 NCR Book Award. ''Citizens'' was very well-received and sold admirably.  Its view that the violence of the Terror was inherent from the start of the Revolution, however, has received serious criticism.<ref>Notably in Timothy Tackett, "Interpreting the Terror" ''French Historical Studies'' '''24'''.4 (Autumn 2001:569-578); Tackett's view of swiftly evolving revolution in his prosopography of the deputies, ''Becoming a Revolutionary: The Deputies of the French National Assembly and the Emergence of a Revolutionary Culture, 1789-1790'' (Princeton University Press) 1996, was not fundamentally at variance with Schama.</ref> 

In 1991, he published ''Dead Certainties (Unwarranted Speculations)'', a relatively slender work which was nevertheless of great importance.  It looked at two widely reported deaths a hundred years apart, that of General James Wolfe -- and the famous painting by Benjamin West -- and that of (by murder) George Parkman, brother of the better known Francis Parkman.  Schama mooted some possible (invented) connections between the two cases, exploring the historian's inability "ever to reconstruct a dead world in its completeness however thorough or revealing the documentation," and speculatively bridging "the teasing gap separating a lived event and its subsequent narration."  Not all readers absorbed the nuance of the title: it received a greatly mixed critical and academic reception. (Australia's Keith Windschuttle, in his ''The Killing of History'', took particular exception to the book's overt fictionalizing). It, apparently, sold poorly, but it is highly valued by some.

Schama's ''Landscape and Memory'' (1995) focussed on the relationship between physical environment and folk memory, separating the components of landscape as wood, water and rock, enmeshed in the cultural consciousness of collective "memory" that are embodied in myths, which Schama finds to be expressed outwardly in ceremony and text.  While in many ways even more personal and idiosyncratic than ''Dead Certainties'', roaming through widening circles of digressions, this book was also more traditionally structured and better-defined in its approach. While many reviews remained decidedly mixed, the book was a definite commercial success and won numerous prizes.

Appropriately, many of the plaudits came from the art world rather than from traditional academia. This was borne out when Schama became art critic for ''The New Yorker'' in 1995. He held the position for three years, dovetailing his regular column with professorial duties at Columbia University; a selection of his best essays on art for the magazine, chosen by Schama himself, was published in 2005 under the title ''Hang Ups''. During this time, Schama also produced a lavishly illustrated ''Rembrandt's Eyes'', another critical and commercial success. Despite the focus of the book's title, it contrasts the biographies of Rembrandt van Rijn and Peter Paul Rubens.
