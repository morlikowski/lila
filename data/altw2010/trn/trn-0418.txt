'''Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional''' (CSN)  is the second major steel-maker company in Rio de Janeiro.  Its current CEO is Benjamin Steinbruch.

'''Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional''' (CSN) is the largest fully-integrated steel producer in Brazil and one of the largest in South America in terms of crude steel production.  CSN’s Chief Executive Officer is Benjamin Steinbruch.  Its annual crude steel capacity and rolled product capacity are 5.6 million and 5.1 million tons, respectively.  It produces a broad line of steel products, including slabs, hot- and cold-rolled, galvanized and tin mill products.  Its products are used by the distribution, packaging, automotive, home appliance and construction industries. 

CSN accounted for approximately 49% of the galvanized steel products sold in Brazil.  In 2004, it accounted for approximately 98% of the tin mill products sold in Brazil.  It is one of the world’s leading producers of tin mill products.  CSN is also unique in owning its own source of iron ore. 

==History==
===Foundation===
It was created as a state-owned company in April 9, 1941, during the "Estado Novo", by Brazilian president, Getulio Vargas, after an agreement between the American and the Brazilian governments for the construction of a facility that would provide steel for the Allies during the Second World War and later be an aid for Brazil's development.  It began its operations in 1946, under Eurico Gaspar Dutra's presidency.

CSN was a Brazilian corporation incorporated in 1941 pursuant to a decree of Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas.  The Presidente Vargas Steelworks, located at Volta Redonda, in Rio de Janeiro State, started production in 1946.  It initially produced coke, pig iron castings and long products.  Two major expansions were undertaken at the Presidente Vargas Steelworks during the 1970s.  The first, completed in 1974, increased installed annual production capacity to 1.6 million tons of crude steel.  The second, completed in 1977, raised capacity to 2.4 million tons of crude steel.

===Growth of CSN post-1980===
CSN underwent another expansion  in 1989, increasing capacity to 4.5 million tons of crude steel.  Until 1993, CSN was a government entity.  It was privatized through a series of auctions held in 1993 and early 1994, through which the Brazilian government sold its 91% interest in the company.

In 1993, CSN adopted a capital improvement program, which was revised and extended in 1995.  The goals of the capital improvement program were to increase the annual production of crude steel, to improve the productivity of the production units and the quality of the products, and to enhance the environmental protection and cleanup programs.  Since February 1996, all production has been based on the continuous casting process, rather than ingot casting, an alternative method that results in higher energy use and metal loss.  From 1996 through 2002, CSN spent the equivalent of US$2.4 billion under the capital improvement program and for operational capacity maintenance, culminating with the revamping in 2001 of Blast Furnace #3 and Hot Strip Mill #2 at the Presidente Vargas Steelworks that increased the annual production capacity to 5.6 million tons of crude steel and 5.1 million tons of rolled products, from approximately 5.0 million tons in each case at the beginning of 2001.

In 2005, CSN set its sights high: To reinforce its position as the largest iron-mining operation in the country,through its controlling stake in Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), and to join the exclusive global club of the world's largest suppliers of the commodity. 

In January 2004, the CSN board announced the approval of investments up to US$820 million to be made through 2007, for:
• The expansion of the annual production of the Casa de Pedra iron ore mine from 15.5 million tons in 2004 to approximately 40 million tons.
• The expansion of the coal terminal adjacent to the Sepetiba Port facilities to enable annual exports of up to 30 million tons of iron ore.
• The construction of a six million-ton pellet plant.

CSN also explored opportunities for acquisitions or mergers abroad in order to expand output.  It proposed to build a new steel plant which would have doubled current annual production of 5.8 million tons of raw steel, at an estimated investment cost of US$2.6 billion, assuming prospecting results pan out.  Seeking to maintain focus on its program of acquisitions and growth, CSN set aside $520 million for investments in 2005.

===Privatization===
It was a state-owned firm until 1993, when it was privatized by Itamar Franco's government, during the National Program for Privatization led by the federal government, started by Fernando Collor and continued by Franco. <ref>Arquivo Nacional (Brasil), ''Os Presidentes e a República: Deodoro da Fonseca a Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva'', 2ª ed., Rio de Janeiro, 2003, pg. 189.</ref>

Its main factories are located in Volta Redonda, at the Vale do Paraíba region, southern Rio de Janeiro state, and its iron mines at Congonhas and Arcos, both of them cities in the Minas Gerais state, and the coal mines at Siderópolis, Santa Catarina state.

During almost 50 years of state control, the Brazilian flat steel sector was coordinated on a national basis under the auspices of Siderbrás, the national steel monopoly.  The state had far less involvement in the non-flat steel sector, which has traditionally been made up of smaller private sector companies.  The larger integrated flat steel producers operated as semiautonomous companies under the control of Siderbrás and were individually privatized during 1991 to 1993.  CSN believes that the privatization of the steel sector in Brazil has resulted in improved financial performance as a result of increased efficiencies, higher levels of productivity, lower operating costs, a decline in the labor force and a resumption of investment.

==Production==
CSN primarily operates as an integrated steel producer in Brazil. It produces a line of steel products, including slabs, which are semi-finished products used for processing hot-rolled, cold-rolled, or coated coils and sheet products; hot-rolled products comprising heavy-gauge hot-rolled coils and sheets, and light-gauge hot-rolled coils and sheets; cold-rolled products, including cold-rolled coils and sheets; and galvanized products consisting of flat-rolled steel coated with zinc or a zinc-based alloy.  The company also offers tin mill products, including tin plate, tin free steel, low tin coated steel, and black plate products.  CSN also mines iron ore, limestone, and dolomite, and maintains strategic investments in railroads and power supply companies.  The company sells its steel products to customers in Brazil and 71 other countries in North America, Europe, and Asia through its sales force and distributors.  It is considered one of the most productive steel-makers in the world, producing more than 6 million tons of raw steel and more than 5 million tons of laminates per year.

==Holding==
CSN owns different firms, such as GalvaSud (in Porto Real - Rio de Janeiro), Inal (in Mogi das Cruzes - São Paolo and Barra Mansa - Rio de Janeiro), CSN PARANÁ (in Araucária - Paraná) and container (TECON) and coal (TECAR) terminals in the Itaguaí port (in Itaguaí - Rio de Janeiro).  It also has control through shareholding in MRS Logistics, CFN, in railway transportation, the hydroelectric generators of Igarapava between the São Paulo and Minas Gerais states and Itá, between Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul states, and factories in the United States and Portugal.

==Domestic government policies==
===Anti-dumping, Countervailing Duties, Safeguards and Government Protectionism===
Protectionist measures adopted by the governments in some of CSN's main markets could adversely affect crucial export sales.  In response to the increased production and exports of steel in many countries, anti-dumping, countervailing duties and safeguard measures have been imposed by countries which represent some of the main markets for CSN exports.  Those, and similar, measures could provoke an imbalance in the international steel market, which could adversely affect CSN's exports.

===Potential Costs of Environmental Compliance; Mining Regulation===
New environmental standards imposed on CSN may require capital expenditures that do not increase productivity.  CSN's steel-making facilities are subject to a broad range of laws, regulations and permit requirements in Brazil relating to the protection of human health and the environment. 

===Dependence on Water Source===
Large amounts of water are required in the production of steel.  CSN's principal source of water is the Paraíba do Sul river, which runs through the city of Volta Redonda.  Much of the water is recirculated, and some, after processing, is returned to the Paraíba do Sul river.  A law passed in 1997 permits the Brazilian government to charge for water usage from water courses.

'''Brazilian government policies in the energy sector may have an adverse impact on the cost or supply of electricity for CSN aluminum-related and ferroalloy operations.'''

'''Tax and Social Security Reforms May Affect the Brazilian Economy, and May Impose a Higher Tax Burden on CSN.'''

The Brazilian Federal Congress has recently amended the Brazilian Constitution to modify certain aspects of the social security and tax system.  Moreover, the Brazilian Federal Congress is currently reviewing additional bills which would introduce further changes to Brazil's tax and social security laws.  Such reforms may affect Brazilian economic conditions generally, and may impose a higher tax burden on CSN.  If CSN is not able to pass the cost of such potential higher tax and social security burdens to  customers, their profit margins may be adversely affected.

A '''Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional''' ('''CSN''') é a maior indústria siderúrgica do Brasil e da América Latina e uma das maiores do mundo.

Sua usina situa-se na cidade de sul do estado do Arcos, ambas  cidades do estado de Minas Gerais e também de carvão na região de Siderópolis no estado de Santa Catarina.

Criada em Estado Novo, por decreto do presidente Getúlio Vargas, após um acordo diplomático, denominado ''Acordos de Washington'', feito entre os  governos brasileiro e estadunidense, que previa a construção de uma usina siderúrgica que pudesse fornecer aço para os aliados durante a Segunda Guerra e, na paz, ajudasse no desenvolvimento do Brasil. Começou efetivamente a operar em 1946, durante o governo do presidente Eurico Gaspar Dutra, o qual, de modo descortês, não convidou o idealizador do projeto para a inauguração, o Presidente Getúlio Vargas.

Foi uma empresa estatal até Fernando Collor e Itamar Franco.

Sua principal usina hoje produz cerca de 6 milhões de toneladas de aço bruto e mais de 5 milhões de toneladas de laminados por ano, sendo considerada uma das mais produtivas do mundo.

Atualmente, a CSN possui diversas empresas, como a GalvaSud (em Araucária-PR), os terminais de contêineres (TECON) e de carvão (TECAR) no Porto de Itaguaí (em Itá, entre os estados de Estados Unidos e em Portugal.
