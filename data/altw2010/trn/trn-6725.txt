'''Niels Kaj Jerne''', FRS (Danish (English-born) Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984. The citation read "For theories concerning the specificity in development and control of the immune system and the discovery of the principle for production of monoclonal antibodies"[http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1984/]. He shared the prize with Georges J. F. Köhler and César Milstein.

== The early years ==

His ancestors had lived on the small Danish island of Fanø for centuries, but in 1910 his parents moved to London where Jerne was born in 1911. During the First World War his parents moved to The Netherlands and Jerne spent his youth in Rotterdam. After studying physics for two years at the Leiden University Jerne moved to Copenhagen and changed his studies to the field of medicine. He graduated from the University of Copenhagen with a degree in medicine in 1947, and in 1951 he was awarded the doctorate for a thesis titled "A Study of Avidity Based on Rabbit Skin Responses to Diphteria Toxin-Antitoxin Mixtures".

== Research positions ==

From Department of Microbiology for four years. Jerne continued to do work for the World Health Organization as a member of the Expert Advisory Panel of Immunology from 1962 and onwards. 

In 1966 Jerne moved back to Europe and took up the position of Professor of Experimental Therapy at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt. In 1969 Jerne again switched jobs, this time to Basel in Switzerland, where he was the Director of the Basel Institute for Immunology until his retirement in 1980.

傑尼在1943年至1956年間，曾於丹麥國家血清研究院擔任研究員，他在這段期間構想出抗體形成的理論。1956年後傑尼進入日內瓦的世界衛生組織工作，1962年移居美國，擔任匹茲堡大學的微生物學教授。到了1966年，他再度回到歐洲，於德國法蘭克福任教。從1969年直到1980年退休為止，傑尼一直在瑞士巴塞爾的巴塞爾免疫學研究院工作。他曾結過三次婚，育有三名兒子。
