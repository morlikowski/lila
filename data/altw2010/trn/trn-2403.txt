thumb|right|Historical population of Lesotho, Data of [[FAO, year 2005; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
According to the 2006 census, Lesotho has a total population of 1,872,721.<ref name="census"></ref> Of the population, 23.74 percent lived in urban and 76.26 percent in rural areas.<ref name="census" /> The country's capital, Maseru, accounts for around half of the total urban population. The sex distribution is 911,848 male and 960,873 female, or around 95 males for each 100 females.<ref name="census" />

The average population density in the country is around 61,7 people per square kilometer. The density is lower in the highlands than in the western lowlands. Although the majority of the population—59.8 percent—is between 15 and 64 years of age, Lesotho has a substantial youth population numbering around 35.3 percent.<ref name="factbook" /> The annual population growth rate is estimated at 0.13%<ref name="factbook" />

==Ethnic groups and languages==
Due to Lesotho's long history as a unified nation, that continued even through British colonial rule, the ethnic makeup of the country is very homogenous. Lesotho's ethno-linguistic structure consists almost entirely of the Basotho (singular ''Mosotho''), a Bantu-speaking people: an estimate of 99.7 percent of the people identify as Basotho.<ref name="factbook"></ref> The Kwena (Bakoena) are the largest subgroup of the Sotho; other Basotho subgroups include the Natal (North) Nguni, Batloung (the Tlou), Baphuthi (the Phuti), Bafokeng, Bataung (the Tau), Bats'oeneng (the tso'ene) and the Cape (South) Nguni (Thembu). Other ethnic groups include Europeans, numbering in the thousands, and several hundred Asians.<ref name="commonwealth"></ref>

Sesotho (Southern Sotho) and English languages are both official.<ref name="factbook" /> Zulu, Xhosa and French are also spoken.
