'''Актинии''' (''Actiniaria''), морские анемоны, отряд морских кишечнополостных животных класса коралловых полипов (''Anthozoa'').

Лишенные скелета, почти всегда одиночные полипы; цилиндрическое тело(от нескольких мм до 1,5 м в поперечнике) усечено вверху и несет щелевидный рот, окруженный венчиком щупалец; внизу оканчивается обыкновенно плоской «подошвою», c помощью которой присасываются к подводным предметам; реже нижний конец заострен, и тогда просто торчат в песке; некоторые плавают. Питаются различными мелкими животными и даже мелкими рыбами. Добычу схватывают щупальцами, вооружёнными стрекательными клетками, «выстрелы» которых парализуют или убивают жертву, а у человека могут вызвать болезненные ожоги. Некоторые живут в симбиозе с раками-отшельниками и др. беспозвоночными, а так же с некоторыми видами рыб, например, с рыбами-клоунами. Большинство ярко окрашено (преоблад. цвета желтые и красные). Распространены широко, однако большинство обитает в тропических и субтропических водах.

'''Sea anemones''' are a group of water dwelling, order '''Actiniaria'''; they are named after the Hydra''.

==Anatomy==
A sea anemone is a small sac, attached at the bottom to the surface beneath it by an adhesive foot, called a basal disc, with a column shaped body ending in an oral disc. The mouth is in the middle of the oral disc, surrounded by tentacles armed with many everting, giving phylum Cnidaria its name&nbsp;<ref></ref>. The cnidae that sting are called ''actinoporins—an inner filament and an external sensory hair. When the hair is touched, it mechanically triggers the cell explosion, a harpoon-like structure which attaches to organisms that trigger it, and injects a dose of poison in the flesh of the aggressor or prey. This gives the anemone its characteristic sticky feeling.

The poison is a mix of toxins, including neurotoxins, which paralyze the prey, which is then moved by the tentacles to the mouth/anus for digestion inside the gastrovascular cavity. Actinoporins have been reported as highly toxic to fish and crustaceans, which may be the natural prey of sea anemones. In addition to their role in predation, it has been suggested that actinoporins could act, when released in water, as repellents against potential predators. Certain clownfish are not affected by their host anemone's sting.<ref>http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/pgallery/pgfagatele/living/living_03_100.html</ref>

The internal anatomy of anemones is simple. There is a gastrovascular cavity (which functions as a stomach) with a single opening to the outside which functions as both a mouth and an anus: waste and undigested matter is excreted through the mouth/anus, which can be described as an incomplete gut. A primitive nervous system, without centralization, coordinates the processes involved in maintaining homeostasis as well as biochemical and physical responses to various stimuli. Anemones range in size from less than 1¼&nbsp;cm (½&nbsp;in) to nearly 2&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;ft) in diameter. They can have a range of 10 tentacles to hundreds.

The muscles and nerves in anemones are much simpler than those of other animals. Cells in the outer layer (epidermis) and the inner layer (gastrodermis) have microfilaments grouped together into contractile fibers. These are not true muscles because they are not freely suspended in the body cavity as they are in more developed animals. Since the anemone lacks a skeleton, the contractile cells pull against the gastrovascular cavity, which acts as a hydrostatic skeleton. The stability for this hydrostatic skeleton is caused by the anemone shutting its mouth, which keeps the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume, making it more rigid.

==Exploitation==
The global trade in marine ornamentals is an expanding industry. In the early 1980s the estimated value of imported marine fish and invertebrates was US $24-40 million annually.<ref>Wood, E. 1985. "Exploitation of coral reef fishes for the aquarium trade." Report to the Marine Conservation Society. Marine Conservation Society, UK.</ref> Current estimates place that value at US $200-330 million,<ref>Chapman, F. A.; Fitz-Coy, S. A.; Thunberg, E. M.; Adams, C. M. 1997. United States of America trade in ornamental fish. Journal of the World Aquaculture Society. Vol. 28:1–10.</ref> with the USA accounting for 80% of the industry imports.<ref>Larkin, S.L.; Degner, R.L. 2001. The U.S. wholesale market for marine ornamentals. Aquarium Sciences and Conservation. Vol. 3:13–24.</ref> Despite advances and the expansion of anemones. The demand for these organisms is reflected in fishermen's catch records, which document the value they are paid per catch, and on average anemones were valued at five times the value of the average value of anemones and anemones. It should be noted that anemonefish can survive alone in captivity, as has been shown by multiple research efforts.<ref>Fautin, Daphne Gail. 1991. “The Anemonefish Symbiosis: What is known and What is Not.” Symbiosis.

The sea anemone has a foot which in most species attaches itself to rocks or anchors in the sand. Others also burrow into a stronger object. Some species attach to kelp and others are free-swimming. Although not single-celled green algae species which reside in the animals' gastrodermal cells. These algae may be either zooxanthellae, zoochlorellae or both. The sea anemone benefits from the products of the algae's photosynthesis, namely oxygen and food in the form of glycerol, glucose and alanine; the algae in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro-feeders, which the anemones actively maintain. The algae also benefit by being protected due to the presence of stinging cells called nematocysts, reducing the likelihood of being eaten by herbivores.  Most species inhabit tropical reefs, although there are species adapted to relatively cold waters, intertidal reefs, and sand/kelp environments.

==Life cycle==

Unlike other cnidarians, anemones (and other medusa stage of the life cycle: the polyp produces eggs and sperm, and the fertilized egg develops into a planula that develops directly into another polyp.

A few anemones are parasitic to marine organisms. Anemones tend to stay in the same spot until conditions become unsuitable (prolonged dryness, for example), or a predator is attacking them. In the case of an attack, anemones can release themselves from the substrate and swim away to a new location using flexing motions.

The sexes in sea anemones are separate for some species while some are hermaphroditic. Both sexual and asexual reproduction may occur. In sexual reproduction males release sperm which stimulates females to release eggs, and fertilization occurs. The eggs or sperm are ejected through the mouth. The fertilized egg develops into a planula, which finally settles down and grows into a single anus. They can also reproduce asexually by budding, binary fission, which involves pulling apart into two halves, and pedal laceration, in which small pieces of the pedal disc break off and regenerate into small anemones.
