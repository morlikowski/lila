"'''Bebot'''" is a song from Monkey Business''. The title is a Tagalog slang word which means "hot chick".<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1536408/20060714/story.jhtml Black Eyed Peas' Low-Budget 'Bebot' Shoot - News Story | Music, Celebrity, Artist News | MTV News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A music video was shot and released independently in 2006.

==Background==
In a similar fashion to "The Apl Song", which appeared on the group's 2003 album Elephunk, the song is rapped solo by apl.de.ap as a tribute to his childhood upbringing in the Philippines. However, in contrast to the first song's somber tone, "Bebot" is an uptempo song designed to be played at parties and clubs.

The term "Bebot" is Filipino slang for "pretty woman", "hot chick", "hottie", "baby/babe". The music video for Bebot features primarily Filipinos, Filipino Americans and several other Asian ethnicities from the Los Angeles area (Korean Americans, Japanese Americans, Chinese Americans, Thai Americans, Indonesian Americans, Vietnamese Americans, etc.). 

In 2006, Patricio Ginelsa (Kid Heroes Productions) and AJ Calomay (Xylophone Films), who also produced and directed "The Apl Song" and the Filipino American action comedy movie, ''Lumpia'' were enlisted to make a music video for "Bebot"

==Music videos==
Two different music videos for "Bebot" were filmed in early July 2006 and premiered online on The Fast and the Furious''', is seen alongside many of the vehicles.

===Generation One===
The other version, consequently labeled "Generation One" for its portrayal of first-generation Filipino Americans, is set in the 1930s and focuses on showing the life the early Filipino immigrants in Fergie) are the objects of the Filipino men's affection. In the early days of Filipino American immigration, only men were allowed into the United States, thus accounting for a large gender disparity in the Filipino American community. Therefore, Filipino American men often courted Caucasian women. Historically, courtships and sexual relations between Filipino men and Caucasian women caused a backlash amongst Caucasian men, leading to left|thumb|apl.de.ap singing behind a coloured background.

===Generation Two===
The "Generation Two" video is included in the Black Eyed Peas' music DVD, "Live From Sydney to Vegas". Before the video was officially released online, it was played at a Black Eyed Peas concert at Araneta Coliseum in Manila, Philippines as apl.de.ap performed the song.

The video begins with an introduction with Fergie and Taboo knocking on APL's house which then his mom answers and starts to talk to them in a thick, heavy Filipino accent and then she asks Allan to come down and starts to embarrass him and then his baby sister Jasmine comes and Fergie tells his mom they're going to the park. The music begins and shows Apl, Fergie, Will.I.Am and Taboo in different colour backgrounds singing. It then shows Apl, Fergie, Will.I.Am, Taboo and his little sister singing at the park with girls and cars having a good time. The video finishes with Them at a house party singing in a group together.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQAGh3JViyI YouTube - Bebot - Black Eyed Peas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
