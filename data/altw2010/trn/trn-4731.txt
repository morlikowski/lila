'''Hesperornithes''' is an extinct and highly specialized genera such as ''Hesperornis'', ''Parahesperornis'', ''Baptornis'', ''Enaliornis'', and probably ''Potamornis'', all strong-swimming predatory waterbirds. Many, if not all species were completely flightless. The largest known hesperornithine, described in 1999 and named ''Canadaga arctica'', may have reached a maximum adult length of over 1.5 meters (five feet).

Hesperornithine birds were, strictly speaking, the only all birds are dinosaurs); the aquatic extinct at the K-T boundary, along with enantiornithine protobirds, all non-avian dinosaurs, and many other life forms. 

==Anatomy and ecology==
Most of what is known about this group rests on analyses of single species, as few provide sufficiently diverse fossils for analysis. In most cases, what holds true for one hesperornithine also applies to the others, as these birds were quite stereotypical and extreme in their autapomorphies.

Although some of the smaller species might have been able to fly, ''Hesperornis'' and ''Baptornis'' had only vestigial wings. Like living foot-propelled diving birds, the femur and metatarsus were short, whereas the tibia was long. The legs were also set far back on the body, as in loons, grebes or penguins. Hesperornithids must have been powerful swimmers and divers but extremely ungainly on the land, and probably spent little time ashore except to nest (indeed, it has been suggested that they did not incubate their eggs).

Some researchers think that on land they had to slide on their bellies and push with their legs; the hip and knee joints were shaped such that these birds could not move them dorsoventrally, and in a resting position  the feet projected sideways from the body, which would have prevented them from walking upright. Whereas ''Hesperornis'' had probably lobes of skin on its toes similar to the grebes of today, the toes of ''Baptornis'' could not rotate (necessary in lobed feet to reduce drag) and thus were more likely webbed, as in loons. The dense bones of these birds decreased their buoyancy, making diving easier<ref name=chinsamy>Chinsamy ''et al.'' (1998)</ref>.

The beak was long, probably hooked at the tip, and bore a series of simple, sharp teeth which were set into a longitudinal groove. These and probably helped to seize fish, as does the serrated beak of mergansers today; unlike the reptilian teeth of other toothed birds, those of the hesperornithids were unique<ref>Discussed in Marsh (1880), Gregory, (1952).</ref>. Given that teeth are induced by a rather simple genetic mechanism<ref>Discussed at length by Harris ''et al.'' (2006).</ref>, it is even possible that these birds re-evolved them and that some ancestors of the hesperornithids were toothless.

==Systematics and evolution==
These birds were originally combined with ''Ichthyornis'' in the paraphyletic "Odontornithes" by Othniel Charles Marsh, in 1873. In 1875, they were separated as '''Odontolcae'''. The group was often considered to be allied to loons and grebes<ref>E.g. by Cracraft (1982). That study is interesting example of how to arrive at an essentially phenetic - and utterly incorrect - analysis in spite of using cladistic methods.</ref>,
or to the Paleognathae<ref>Based on a perceived similarity of the bony palate (Gingerich 1973).</ref>. These similarities, however, as the more recently determined fact that the osteons of their bones - at least in ''Hesperornis'' - were arranged in a pattern similar to that in Neognathae<ref>See Houde (1987).</ref>, are today considered to be due to convergent evolution<ref>This is not a new theory; it was proposed by Stolpe as early as 1935. See also Bogdanovich (2003).</ref>.

Currently, the hesperornithine birds are recognized as a very specialized lineage that is not ancestral or otherwise closely related to the birds of today. Still, their relationship is close enough that they probably diverged from the ancestors of today's birds as late as the earliest Cretaceous. 

The discovery that ''mya. Given the tendency of birds that have become flightless to increase in size markedly in just a few million years, the probability of Hesperornithes deriving from an animal at least superficially similar and not too far related to ''Gansus'' is quite high. The new fossil material of that species should assist in determining the number of synapomorphies of hesperornithines and other ornithurans, which have until now been muddied by the numerous autapomorphies of the former.

Die '''Hesperornithiformes''' sind eine Gruppe bezahnter flugunfähiger Tauchvögel, deren Kreidezeit Nordamerikas, Eurasiens und Antarktikas vorkommen.

]]
Die älteste der bekannten Gattungen ist ''Enaliornis'' aus der Unteren Kreide (Campan nachgewiesen und somit die langlebigste der bisher entdeckten Gattungen der Hesperornithiformes. Im Maastrichtium, am Ende der Kreide, starb die Gruppe aus.

Als Tauchvögel, die mit den Beinen schwammen, besaßen ''Enaliornis'', ''Hesperornis'' und ''Baptornis'' estuarinen und kontinentalen Ablagerungen, die belegen, dass sie nicht nur marine sondern auch andere aquatische Lebensräume 
bewohnten.

Die größten bislang bekannten Vertreter gehören der 1999 beschrieben Art ''Canadaga arctica'' an. Sie konnten Längen von über 1,5 Metern erreichen.

Die Vertreter der Hesperornithiformes besaßen ebenso wie viele die meisten anderen Vögel der Kreidezeit im Schnabel Reihen einfacher, scharfer Zähne, die beispielsweise zum Ergreifen von Fischbeute geeignet waren. Marsh beschrieb im Jahr 1880 ''Ichthyornis'' und ''Hesperornis'' aus der Niobrara-Formation als Mitglieder der Gruppe Odontornithes („Kreidezahnvögel“). Es zeigte sich jedoch, dass die möwenähnlichen Ichthyornithiformes näher mit den modernen Vögeln (Neornithes) verwandt sind als mit den Hesperornithiformes.
