The '''walrus''' (''Odobenus rosmarus'') is a large flippered family and '''''Odobenus''''' genus. It is subdivided into three subspecies:<ref name=msw3/> the '''Atlantic Walrus''' (''O. rosmarus rosmarus'') found in the Atlantic Ocean, the '''Pacific Walrus''' (''O. rosmarus divergens'') found in the Pacific Ocean, and '''''O. rosmarus laptevi''''', found in the Laptev Sea.  

The walrus is immediately recognizable due to its prominent whiskers and great bulk. Adult Pacific males can weigh up to ,<ref>[http://www.walruses.net/ Walruses - Walrus Facts and Types - walruses.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and, among shelf habitat, spending a significant proportion of its life on sea ice in pursuit of its preferred diet of benthic bivalve mollusks. It is a relatively long-lived, social animal and is considered a keystone species in Arctic marine ecosystems.  

The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many indigenous Arctic peoples, who have hunted the walrus for its ivory and its numbers declined rapidly. Its global population has since rebounded, though the Atlantic and Laptev populations remain fragmented and at historically depressed levels.  

==Etymology==
The origins of the word "walrus" has variously been attributed to combinations of the Dutch words ''walvis'' ("whale") and ''ros'' ("horse")<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/walrus Dictionary.com]</ref> or ''wal'' ("shore") and ''reus'' ("giant").<ref>[http://www.iberianature.com/trivia/etymology_mammals.htm Etymology of mammal names, iberianature.com]</ref> However, the most likely origin of the word is the Old Norse ''hrossvalr,'' meaning "horse-whale", which was passed in a juxtaposed form to Dutch and the North-German dialects of the Hanseatic League as ''walros'' and ''Walross''.<ref>Dansk Etymologisk Ordbog, Niels Age Nielsen, Gyldendal 1966</ref>

The now archaic English word for walrus ''morse'' is widely supposed to have come from the Slavic.<ref>"morse, n., etymology of" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. http://dictionary.oed.com/</ref> Thus ''морж'' (morž) in Russian, ''mors'' in Polish, also ''mursu'' in Finnish, ''moršâ'' in Saami, later ''morse'' in French, ''morsa'' in Spanish, etc.  

The compound ''Odobenus'' comes from ''odous'' (Greek for "tooth") and ''baino'' (Greek for "walk"), based on observations of walruses using their tusks to pull themselves out of the water. ''Divergens'' in Latin means "turning apart", referring to the tusks.

==Taxonomy and evolution== 
The walrus is a mammal in the order family Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the suborder Pinnipedia along with true seals (Phocidae), and eared seals (Otariidae). While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are monophyletic, i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or diphyletic, recent genetic evidence suggests that all three descended from a Caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears.<ref name=Lento1995></ref> There remains uncertainty as to whether the odobenids diverged from the otariids before or after the phocids,<ref name=Lento1995/> though the most recent synthesis of the molecular data suggests that the phocids were the first to diverge.<ref name=Arnason06></ref> What is known, however, is that Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty known species in the Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae subfamilies.<ref></ref> The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining (relict) species. 

Two subspecies of the walrus are commonly recognized: the Atlantic Walrus, ''O. r. rosmarus'' (Illiger, 1815) and the '''Pacific Walrus''', ''O. r. divergens'' (Linnaeus, 1758). Fixed genetic differences between the Atlantic and Pacific subspecies indicate very restricted gene flow, but relatively recent separation, estimated to have occurred 500,000 and 785,000 years ago.<ref name=Hoelzel2002></ref> These dates coincide with the fossil derived hypothesis that the walrus evolved from a tropical or sub-tropical ancestor that became isolated in the Atlantic Ocean and gradually adapted to colder conditions in the Arctic.<ref name=Hoelzel2002/> From there, it presumably re-colonized the North Pacific during high glaciation periods in the Pleistocene via the Central American Seaway.<ref name="Arnason06"/> A third, isolated population of the walrus in the Laptev Sea is considered by some, including Russian biologists and the canonical Mammal Species of the World,<ref name=msw3/> to be a third subspecies, ''O. r. laptevi'' (Chapskii, 1940), when it was described and is managed as such in Russia.<ref></ref> Where the subspecies separation is not accepted, there remains debate as to whether it should be considered a subpopulation of the Atlantic or Pacific subspecies.<ref></ref><ref name="Fay85"/>

== Range and population==
thumb|right|250px|Walrus colony  
There were roughly 200,000 Pacific Walruses according to the last census-based estimation in 1990.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The majority of the Pacific Walrus population spends the summer north of the last ice age.<ref></ref>  

The Atlantic Walrus, which was nearly decimated by commercial harvest, is much smaller. Good estimates are difficult to obtain, but the total number is probably below 20,000.<ref>[NAMMCO] North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission. 1995. Report of the third meeting of the Scientific Committee. In: NAMMCO Annual Report 1995, NAMMCO, Tromsø, pp. 71-127.</ref><ref></ref> It ranges from the Canadian Arctic, Greenland, Svalbard and the western portion of the Russian Arctic. There are eight presumed sub-populations of the Atlantic Walrus based largely on geographical distribution and movement data, five to the west and three to the east of Greenland.<ref></ref> The Atlantic Walrus once enjoyed a range that extended south to Cape Cod and occurred in large numbers in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In April 2006, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Northwest Atlantic Walrus population (Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador) as being extirpated in Canada.<ref></ref>

The isolated Laptev population is confined year-round to the central and western regions of the Laptev Sea, the easternmost regions of the Kara Sea, and the westernmost regions of the East Siberian Sea. Current populations are estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000 individuals.<ref></ref>

While isolated Pacific males can weigh as much as , most weigh between  and . Females weigh about two thirds as much as males, and the Atlantic subspecies is about 90% as massive as the Pacific subspecies.<ref name="Fay85"/> The Atlantic Walrus also tends to have relatively shorter tusks and somewhat more flattened true seals (Phocidae). As with otariids, it has a prominent thick neck and the ability to turn its rear flippers forward and move on all fours; however, its swimming technique is more similar to that of true seals, relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements.<ref name="Fay85"/> Like phocids, it also lacks external ears. 

The most prominent physical feature of the walrus is its long tusks, actually elongated canines, which are present in both sexes and can reach a length of  and .<ref></ref> These are slightly longer and thicker among males, who use them for fighting, dominance and display; the strongest males with the largest tusks typically dominating social groups. Tusks are also used to form and maintain holes in the ice and haul out onto ice.<ref name="Fay82"></ref> It was previously assumed that tusks were used to dig out prey items from the seabed, but analyses of abrasion patterns on the tusks indicate that they are dragged through the sediment while the upper edge of the snout is used for digging.<ref name="Ray06"></ref> The walrus has relatively few teeth other than the great canine tusks, and typically has a dental formula of:

Surrounding the tusks is a broad mat of stiff bristles ('mystacial vibrissae'), giving the walrus a characteristic whiskered appearance. There can be 400 to 700 vibrissae in 13 to 15 rows reaching  in length, though in the wild they are often worn to a much shorter length due to constant use in foraging.<ref name=Kastelein1990></ref> The vibrissae are attached to muscles and are supplied with blood and nerves making the vibrissal array a highly sensitive organ capable of differentiating shapes  thick and  wide.<ref name="Kastelein1990"/>

Aside from the vibrissae, the walrus is sparsely covered with fur and appears bald. Its skin is highly wrinkled and thick, up to  around the neck and shoulders of males. The blubber layer beneath is up to  thick. Young walruses are deep brown and grow paler and more cinnamon colored as they age. Old males, in particular, become nearly pink. Because the blood vessels in the skin constrict in cold water, the walrus can appear almost white when swimming. As a secondary sexual characteristic, males also acquire significant nodules, called ''bosses'', particularly around the neck and shoulders.<ref name="Fay82"/>    

The walrus has an air sac under its throat which acts like a flotation bubble and allows the walrus to bob vertically in the water and sleep. The males possess a large baculum (penis bone), up to  in length, the largest of any mammal both absolutely and relative to body size.<ref name="Fay85"/>

==Life cycle==
thumb|left|Walruses fighting

The walrus lives around 50 years. The males reach sexual maturity as early as 7 years, but do not typically mate until fully developed around 15 years of age. They go into a rut in January through April, decreasing their food intake dramatically. The females can begin ovulating as soon as 4–6 years old. The females are polyestrous, coming into heat in late summer and also around February, yet the males are only fertile around February; the potential fertility of this second period of estrous is unknown. Breeding occurs from January to March with peak conception in February. Males aggregate in the water around ice-bound groups of estrous females and engage in competitive vocal displays.<ref></ref> The females join them and copulation occurs in the water.<ref name="Fay82"/> 

Total gestation lasts 15 to 16 months, though 3 to 4 of those months are spent with the blastula in suspended development before finally implanting itself in the placenta. This strategy of delayed implantation, common among other pinnipeds, presumably evolved to optimize both the season when females select their mates and the season when the birth itself occurs, determined by ecological conditions that promote survival of the young.<ref></ref> The calves are born during the spring migration from April to June. They weigh  to  at birth and are able to swim. The mothers nurse for over a year before weaning, but the young can spend up to 3 to 5 years with the mothers.<ref name="Fay82"/> Because ovulation is suppressed until the calf is weaned, females give birth at most once every two years, resulting in the walrus having the lowest reproductive rate of any pinniped.<ref></ref> 

In the non-reproductive season (late summer and fall) the walrus tends to migrate away from the ice and form massive aggregations of tens of thousands of individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops. The nature of the migration between the reproductive period and the summer period can be a rather long distance and dramatic. In late spring and summer, for example, several hundred thousand Pacific Walruses migrate from the Bering sea into the Chukchi sea through the relatively narrow Bering Strait.<ref name="Fay82"/> 

==Feeding==
thumb|right|[[Vibrissae of captive walrus (Japan)]]
thumb|right|Walruses leaving the water

The walrus prefers shallow shelf regions and forages on the sea bottom. Its dives are not particularly deep compared to other pinnipeds; the deepest recorded dives are around . However, it can remain submerged for as long as a half hour.<ref></ref> 

The walrus has a highly diverse and opportunistic diet, feeding on more than 60 genera of marine organisms including shrimps, crabs, tube worms, soft corals, tunicates, sea cucumbers, various mollusks, and even parts of other pinnipeds.<ref></ref> However, it displays great preference for benthic bivalve mollusks, especially species of clams, for which it forages by grazing along the sea bottom, searching and identifying prey with its sensitive vibrissae and clearing the murky bottoms with jets of water and active flipper movements.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Levermann, N., Galatius, A., Ehlme, G., Rysgaard, S. and Born, E.W. | year = 2003 | title = Feeding behaviour of free-ranging walruses with notes on apparent dextrality of flipper use | journal = BMC Ecology | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/3/9/</ref> The walrus sucks the meat out by sealing the organism in the powerful lips and drawing the tongue, piston-like, rapidly into the mouth, creating a vacuum. The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted, allowing for extremely effective suction to be generated by the tongue.

*セイウチとはロシア語でトドを意味する「シヴーチ」（）に由来する。
*映画『妖星ゴラス』に登場する怪獣マグマはセイウチをモチーフとしている（ただし爬虫類という設定）。その後マグマの着ぐるみは、テレビ特撮番組『ウルトラQ』に登場の怪獣「トドラ」として再利用される。髭が追加されてよりセイウチに近いイメージになっているが、登場人物からは「巨大なアザラシ」と呼ばれている。なお「トドラ」の名称は劇中には登場せず、放映後に商標登録の必要上名づけられたものである。
