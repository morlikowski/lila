'''''The Emperor's New School''''' is an American ABC, and Toon Disney. It is based on the characters and situations seen in the theatrical release ''The Emperor's New Groove'' and its direct-to-video sequel, ''Kronk's New Groove''. It follows the adventures of a young Emperor, Kuzco, as he tries to complete his education, allowing him to return to the throne.

The show premiered on the Disney Channel in January 2006 with its second season premiering on ABC Kids, as well as on Toon Disney at various times.

In Australia, it recently began airing as part of the Seven Network's ''Saturday Disney'' program. Seven has a long-term program supply agreement with Disney/Buena Vista.

Initially, three original cast members returned to voice their characters for the TV series: Eartha Kitt Yzma, Patrick Warburton Kronk and Wendie Malick Chicha. Although Fred Tatasciore voiced the role of Pacha for Season 1, John Goodman returned to the role in Season 2. J.P. Manoux, voices Kuzco, a role he had already performed on ''House of Mouse'', taking over from David Spade. Jessica Di Cicco joined the cast to voice the new character, Malina.

== Setting ==

The show comes after ''The Emperor's New Groove''. This is indicated by knowledge of the events of the movie, which are brought up in multiple episodes.

The show's position in relation to ''Kronk's New Groove'' is less clear. It is possible that the series and ''Kronk's New Groove'' are two separate continuities. In the series, Kronk is still working for Yzma and is single, but in ''Kronk's New Groove'' he retires as Yzma's lackey and gets married during the closing credits. In the beginning of ''Kronk's New Groove'', Yzma is pictured with a cat's tail, claiming it was a side effect from her kitten transformation at the end of ''The Emperor's New Groove''. She does not, however, have a tail in the series. 

Given the continuity of the show (or whatever resembles it), it seems unlikely that "Kronk's New Groove" is canon with it. Ms. Birdwell, Kronk's wife at the end of the movie, has never appeared. Kronk has shown no inclination to leave Yzma (aside from her firing him in "Kronk Moves In") and Yzma has no cat tail nor cat ears. 

It has been confirmed that Emperor's New School takes place in the Idol", although Mr. Maleguaco once referred to it as the Kuzconian Empire. ''The Emperor's New School'' is also a direct continuation of ''The Emperor's New Groove'', which has been confirmed to take place in the Inca empire. Such obvious evidence is illustrated in "Michu Pachu" (a parody of Machu Pichu), the architecture and scenery, Yzma mentioning an Inca funeral mask in "Oops All Doodles" and the idea of Virochocha (a Sapa Inca and also listed as a god). 

The name "Kuzco" is derived from the Peruvian city and capital of the Inca empire, Cuzco.

===Yzma=== 
''Voiced by'': Eartha Kitt

Formerly the 48-year old Royal Advisor to the emperor, Yzma was fired during the events in ''The Emperor's New Groove'' for meddling in Kuzco's affairs and attempting to act as Empress in his absence. Enraged at her unemployment, Yzma and her dim-witted assistant Kronk conspired to remove Kuzco from power so that she could become empress. While she had intended to poison the young emperor during dinner, the potion transformed him into a llama, which she ordered Kronk to dispose of. Unable to bring himself to kill Kuzco, Kronk accidentally dropped him into Pacha's wagon, therefore prompting the events of the movie.    

Having been unsuccessful at disposing of Kuzco during the events of the movie, the series shows more of her plans. She constantly schemes for Kuzco to fail at Kuzco Academy, thus allowing herself to rule, and disguises herself as Principal Amzy (Yzma spelled backwards) in order to achieve that end. A running gag with this identity comes from Kronk's inability to comprehend that she and Principal Amzy are one and the same. She often has to rip off her disguise in order to make him understand. Like most villains, she comes up with grandiose plans and schemes with a set objective in mind but fails to pay attention to the minor details of it. More often than not, her lack of thought concerning the situation causes her scheme to backfire. She is often unsuccessful at taking into account Kuzco's devious personality, and Kronk's dimwitted nature. Most of her plans in the series are much more lighthearted, with a few exceptions. Where in the movie she wanted him dead, in the show she simply wants him to fail school, and while sometimes her plans involve Kuzco's death they usually just involve detaining him or transforming him so that he cannot complete the task needed to pass whatever class he is close to failing.she is disposed as a school teacher as well so the staff don't realize her.
