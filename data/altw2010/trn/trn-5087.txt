'''Abdul Rashid Ghazi''', född omkr. islamistledare.  

Abdul Rashid vägrade ursprungligen, till skillnad från sin äldre bror Abdul Aziz Ghazi, att genomgå någon formell muslimsk utbildning. Han påbörjade studier vid en madrassa under påtryckning från fadern maulana Muhammad Abdullah men hoppade snart av denna. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6281228.stm]

Abdul Rashid valde istället att klä sig västerländskt och genomföra en mastersutbildning i internationella relationer vid det sekulära Quaid-e-Azam-universitetet i Islamabad. Därefter fick han anställning vid utbildningsministeriet.

Fadern var så missnöjd med Abdul Rashids livsstil att han gjorde brodern Abdul Aziz till ensam arvinge.
Mordet på fadern Muhammad Abdullah kom dock att bli en vändpunkt i Abdul Rashids liv.
Uppmuntrad av den äldre brodern började han studera islam, anlägga skägg och engagera sig i koranskolorna Jamia Hafsa och Jamia Faridia. 

Ghazi var en av ledarna för en koalition av organisationer som 2001 protesterade mot USA:s krig i Afghanistan.

'''Abdul Rashid Ghazi''' (; ca. Balochistan.<ref name="bbc1">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/pakistan/story/2007/07/070711_rajanpur_ghazi_rs.shtml Tadfeen Islamabad mein ki jaey]</ref>

Abdul Rashid Ghazi was killed in "intense crossfire" after Pakistani troops stormed the building he and his militants had been using. He is buried at Madrassah Abdullah, Basti Abdullah near Rojhan Mazari in Central Pakistan.

Abdul Rashid Ghazi vowed to die in his Islamabad mosque rather than surrender - a pledge he kept when he was killed in intense crossfire after troops stormed the building. Since the mosque came under siege a week before, Ghazi repeatedly said that he would rather be "martyred" than give in to the government.

== Education and secular career ==

In his youth, Abdul Rashid Ghazi defied his father's wish that he receive formal Islamic education, because he wanted to live a normal life. Although he later<!--When?--> enrolled at a MSc in International Relations from Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad in 1987-1988.<ref name="bb2">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6281228.stm Obituary: Abdul Rashid Ghazi]</ref><ref name=pTime>[http://www.pakistantimes.net/2007/07/11/top1.htm PakistanTimes: Islamabad Red Mosque Cleric Ghazi Killed]</ref>. According to one of his professor, ''"He was a normal, moderate student who was well adjusted to a co-educational system."''<ref name=pTime/>. After finishing this degree he obtained a job at the Ministry of Education in Islamabad, and also worked with UNESCO.<ref name=pTime/>

==Islamic leadership role==

After the assassination of his father inside the mosque in 1998<ref name="bb2"/><ref name=pTime/>, he and his brother became leaders of Jamia Hafsa and Jamia Faridia madrassas. The brothers admitted to having had good contacts with many of the wanted leaders of al-Qaeda, including Osama Bin Laden. This was in the years before the 11 September, 2001 attacks on the US, when jihad was part of Pakistan's state-sanctioned policy. Since the "war on terror" began, however, both the Lal Masjid and the Jamia Hafsa denied having had any links with organisations now banned for supporting terrorism. But they were vehement in their support for the "jihad against America" and openly condemned President Musharraf. He opposed the Pakistani government's decision to be a part of the Coalition Forces in the Iraq War, as well as Pakistan's commitment to fight terrorism<ref name="bb2"/>. 

In July 2005, Pakistani security forces tried to raid the mosque following suicide bombings earlier that month in London. The security personnel were met by baton-wielding women, who refused to let them enter the mosque or seminary compound. Authorities said the security forces were investigating a link between the seminary and 7 July bombers. 

==Parallel justice system==

Under the leadership of Ghazi and his brother, the two madrassas became actively involved in challenging the writ of the government in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, setting up a parallel radical judiciary inspired by Sharia Law and instigating kidnappings and arson. <ref name="bb3">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6503477.stm Profile: Islamabad's red mosque]</ref> On July 3, 2007, when a continued stand-off between militants barricaded in the Lal Masjid mosque and the government finally turned into a siege of the mosque and neighboring Jamia Hafsa madrassa, Ghazi refused to surrender to the security forces, instead making anti-government rhetoric through the world media.

==Accusations, negotiations, and counter-accusations==

The Government of Pakistan accused him of planning a terrorist attack on important government buildings in Islamabad. His name was later removed from a list of suspects. 

The Pakistani government also accused him of using his students, women and children in the mosque, as human shields for his protection. The students arrested from the Lal Mosque stated that they were not taken hostage by Ghazi Abdul Rashid, in fact they were ready to embrace martyrdom for the cause of the imposition of Sharia Law.
