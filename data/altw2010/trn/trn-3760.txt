'''''The Vinyl Countdown''''' is the fourth EP by Christian rock band Relient K, released exclusively on a clear red 7" vinyl record on Mono Vs Stereo Records. It was released in 2003, a few months after the band's third full-length album, ''Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do'' was released. ''The Vinyl Countdown'' was followed a few months later by the band's Christmas CD, ''Deck the Halls, Bruise Your Hand'', giving the band three releases in one year, and also the second recording on MVS.

The 7" was dedicated to super fan Jesse Alkire (with a note in the bottom corner of the vinyl sleeve reading "Here's to Jesse Alkire"). Jesse is a good friend of lead singer Matthew Thiessen and the rest of the band and received the dedication because he helped write the title track off the release, "The Vinyl Countdown."
