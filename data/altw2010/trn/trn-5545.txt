The '''Second Matsu and Quemoy in the Taiwan Strait in an attempt to seize them from the Republic of China.

It started with the 823 Artillery Bombardment (Traditional Chinese: 八二三炮戰; Simplified Chinese: 八二三炮战; Pinyin: bāèrsān pàozhàn) at 5:30 on August 23, 1958, when People's Liberation Army forces began an intense artillery bombardment of the Quemoy. ROC forces in Quemoy dug in and returned fire. In the subsequent bombardments, roughly 400 ROC troops and around 50 troops on the PRC side were killed.

This was a continuation of the First Taiwan Strait Crisis, which had started immediately after the Korean War.  Chiang Kai-shek had begun to build on the two islands of Matsu and Quemoy. In 1954, PRC began firing artillery at both the islands of Quemoy and Matsu focusing most of the attack on Quemoy. 

The United States Eisenhower Administration responded to ROC's request for aid according to its obligations in the 1954 US-ROC defense treaty by reinforcing US naval units and ordering US naval vessels to help the Nationalist government protect Quemoy's supply lines. Under a secret effort known as Operation Black Magic, the US Navy modified 100 Taiwanese F-86 Sabres with its newly introduced AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile to provide an edge against the PRC MiG-15 and MiG-17 fighters, which had an altitude advantage over the Sabre.  (Recent research from the National Archives also indicates that Air Force was prepared for a nuclear strike against the PRC, but to their surprise, was ordered by President Eisenhower to only use conventional weapons.<ref>"[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb249/index.htm  Air Force Histories Released through Archive Lawsuit Show Cautious Presidents Overruling Air Force Plans for Early Use of Nuclear Weapons]"</ref>)

The Soviet Union dispatched its foreign minister, Andrei Gromyko, to Beijing to discuss China's actions. 

This situation in 1958 continued for 44 days and took approximately 1,000 lives. On 22 September 1958, the Sidewinder was used for the first time when Sabres and MiGs clashed with several MiGs being downed by the F-86s. An even larger engagement occurred 2 days later with many more MiGs being lost.

Faced with a stalemate, the PRC and the ROC called a ceasefire on October 6. Beijing issued a “Message to the Compatriots in Taiwan” in the name of Defense Minister Peng Dehuai; however, the message was actually drafted by Mao Zedong.  The message called for a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue and called for all Chinese to unite against the "American plot to divide China".

'''Второй кризис тайваньского пролива''' - конфликт, произошедшей между Китайской Народной Республикой и Тайванем из-за двух спорных островов.

Конфликт начался с бомбардировки 823 артиллерийской бригады в 5.30 вечера 23 августа 1958 года, когда Народно-освободительная армия Китая начала обстрел спорного острова Кинмен. В ответ тайваньские солдаты открыли огонь. В результате боя погибли 400 тайваньских солдат и 50 солдат НОАК. В дальнейшем произошёл ряд воздушных боёв между ВВС КНР и Тайваня.

Этот конфликт был продолжением первого кризиса тайваньского пролива, который разгорелся после окончания Корейской войны. Еще в 1954 году НОАК начала артиллерийский обстрел спорных островов.
