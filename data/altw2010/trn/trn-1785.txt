==Fictional character biography==
===Obadiah Stane===
====Early years====
Obadiah Stane was a ruthless individual who studied his adversaries to find weaknesses that he could exploit. Ever since he was a child, Stane enjoyed psychological manipulation to his advantage. For instance, in a childhood chess match against another boy whose skill at least equaled his own, he killed the boy's dog so that his mind wasn't on the game. He won easily, and he continued to use similar forms of manipulation through his life. As a child he saw his father Zebediah, a degenerate gambler who at that time was on a "lucky streak", shoot himself in the head playing a game of Russian roulette. This event shaped Obadiah Stane for years to come.

====Hostile takeover====
In adulthood, as a wealthy financier, Obadiah Stane became the president and CEO of his own company, Stane International, as a munitions dealer. He also had a business partnership with the late James Rhodes.<ref>''Iron Man'' #163-165</ref> He also confronted Tony Stark in person.<ref>''Iron Man'' #166</ref> Stane also set up Indries Moomji as Stark's lover without Stark knowing that Moomji was actually the Chessmen's Queen. While all of this was occurring, Stane and his associates conspired to lock Stark International out of various business deals. Stark eventually learned that Stane was the mastermind behind these attacks, but was unable to confront him. The assaults on Stark, his business, and his friend pushed Stark to the edge, and when Stark was scorned by Stane and then spurned by Moomji, he catastrophically relapsed into alcoholism.<ref>''Iron Man'' #167</ref> With the help of S.H.I.E.L.D., Stane succeeded in buying out Stark International, which he then renamed to Stane International. Stark, having fallen off the wagon, relinquished his armor to Jim Rhodes and disappeared to be a homeless vagrant. Rhodes became the new Iron Man while ignoring Stane's demands to relinquish the armor. Stane was thwarted by Rhodes, as the new Iron Man, in his attempt to take over the Iron Man battle-suits.<ref>''Iron Man'' #173-174</ref>

Stane proceeded in manufacturing and supplying munitions and weapons to S.H.I.E.L.D. and others who could pay for them. But, when Tony Stark left, he left behind notes and information on the Iron Man armor. These notes were far from complete and without Stark's mind, they were hard to analyze, but Stane assigned a team of scientists to these notes and working from this, they created the Iron Monger armor which, according to Stane, was "far superior to Stark's Iron Man armor". He even thought of either selling them to the highest bidder or creating an army of them and using them to "take over any country he wanted". He said that this last idea was particularly interesting.

Stane assigned the Termite to sabotage another business rival.<ref>''Iron Man'' #189</ref> He also formed an alliance with Madame Masque.<ref>''Iron Man'' #190</ref>

====Retaliation====
While a vagrant, Stark befriended a pregnant homeless woman. She died in childbirth, but Stark promised to protect the child. This vow helped pull Stark out of his alcoholic state. When Stark recovered, he built a new suit of Iron Man armor, creating what was then the pinnacle of armor design, the Silver Centurion armor; he also founded a new, successful computer company, Circuits Maximus. Stane ordered the abduction of Bethany Cabe, and was revealed as Madame Masque's lover. He sent the Circuits Breaker to attack Circuits Maximus, and realized that the "new" Iron Man was really Tony Stark. Upon learning of his rival's recovery, Stane decided to attack Stark continually again. Stane exchanged the minds of Madame Masque and Bethany Cabe.  He also had Happy Hogan, Pepper Potts, and Bambi Arbogast kidnapped, and then killed Morley Erwin by blowing up Circuits Maximus<ref>''Iron Man'' #195-197-199</ref>. Stane believed that these losses would drive Stark back into alcoholism, but a confrontation with Erwin's sister at the hospital instead inspired Stark to use the new 'Silver Centurion' armor and take the fight to Stane once again.

His confidence and resolution renewed, Stark confronted Stane on the property of Stane International and defeated Stane's agents, including the Chessmen, who had proven a match for his previous armor. Stane donned the Iron Monger armor and confronted Stark personally. The Iron Monger was more powerful than the previous Iron Man armor, but not the Silver Centurion model, which included such features as the ability to absorb the heat from the Iron Monger's thermal rays and channel it into the armor's own energy supplies. Stane tried to defeat Stark by tricking him into entering a room where Happy, Pepper, and Bambi were being held in suspended animation tanks that could sustain them for months; the walls of the room were covered with photo-electric cells that would trigger a circuit sending two hundred thousand volts into their bodies if Stark moved, leaving him with no choice but to stand in the room and starve to death to keep them alive. Fortunately, however, the room's power source was located directly opposite where Stark was standing, allowing him to use the weapons in his chest-plate to destroy the power source.

Having freed his friends, Stark then confronted Stane again, who was holding his last card: the baby of the woman who Stark had befriended while on skid row. Stane told Stark to remove his helmet or he would crush the homeless woman's baby between his palms. Stark, having detected interfering frequencies in his armor's systems throughout the battle, deduced that Stane wasn't experienced enough to pilot the armor without some help in the form of an external computer. He used his armor's pulse bolts to destroy the nearby building that contained that computer, causing Stane's Iron Monger armor to seize up and fall to the ground as Stark swooped in to catch the baby; since Stane based the armor on Stark's old designs, Stark knew that the armor would freeze if it lost the control of an outside source. Stane then removed his helmet and confronted Stark. When Stark told Stane that it was all over and he was defeated, Stane said that he had one thing left; the ability to deprive Stark of the enjoyment he'd receive in his enemy's humiliation and defeat. Refusing to be arrested and humiliated, he then raised his hand to the side of his head and, using the repulsor ray beam, disintegrated his skull.<ref>''Iron Man'' #200</ref> Stark was later able to obtain complete control over his own company, which he renamed Stark Enterprises.

== Biografie ==
===Obadiah Stane===
Obadiah Stane was een meedogenloos individu die altijd zijn tegenstanders bestudeerde in de hoop zwakheden te ontdekken die hij kon uitbuiten. Al sinds zijn jeugd was hij een liefhebber van schaken, en behandelde zijn leven alsof hij een schaakspel speelde. Tevens geloofde Obadiah sterk in psychologische manipulatie om zijn doelen te bereiken.

Als volwassene werd Obadiah CEO van zijn eigen bedrijf, Stane International. Hij was ook een zakenpartner van Howard Stark voordat hij en zijn vrouw omkwamen bij een auto-ongeluk. Nadat Howard was overleden probeerde Obadiah Stark International, dat nu werd geleid door Howards zoon Tony (Iron Man), over te nemen. Stane en zijn agenten, de Chessmen, vielen Stark International aan en overvielen Tony’s vertrouwling James Rhodes. Stark slaagde erin om Tony’s bedrijf over te nemen, en hernoemde het Stane International. Tony, nu een gebroken man, gaf zijn Iron Mankostuum aan Jim Rhodes. Die voorkwam als de nieuwe Iron Man dat Obadiah de andere Iron Man harnassen in handen kreeg. 

Obadiah vond uiteindelijk bouwplannen van een van Iron Mans harnassen, en liet ze analyseren om zelf een soortgelijk harnas te maken. Met dit harnas werd hij de Iron Monger. Iron Mongers eerste grote gevecht was met Tony Stark, die inmiddels was hersteld en zijn positie als Iron Man weer had teruggenomen. Tony had inmiddels een nieuw harnas gebouwd waarmee hij Iron Monger kon verslaan. Obadiah weigerde zich te laten arresteren door de politie nadat hij was verslagen, en pleegde daarom zelfmoord. Kort na Obaidahs dood nam Tony zijn bedrijf terug.

===Ezekiel Stane===
Marvel kondigde in februari 2008 aan dat een nieuwe Iron Monger genaamd Ezekiel Stane zijn intrede zal doen in ''The Order'' #8. Ezekiel is de zoon van Obadiah Stane. 

=== Andere Iron Mongers===
Een ander Iron Monger kostuum werd gebouwd door de industrialist Simon Steele, die het harnas uitleende aan een van zijn werknemers om Dominic Fortune te bevechten.

Een derde Iron Mongerkostuum werd gemaakt door Tony’s voormalige studiegenoot Joey Cosmatos. Dit harnas werd gebruikt door de crimineel Slagmire.
