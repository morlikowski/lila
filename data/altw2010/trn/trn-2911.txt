El '''Futbol de Taula''' és un joc de taula basat en el futbol. Antigament, l'únic material que hi havia per practicar-lo era de la marca subbuteo fet que feia que inicialment se l'anomenés així. Actualment, però, hi ha gran varietat de fabricants de materials homologats i cada jugador pot triar quin d'ells s'adapta millor a les seves necessitats.

El material necessari per jugar un partit és: un camp, dues porteries, una pilota i dos equips amb deu jugadors de camp, un porter sortint i un porter de barra cadascun.

Normalment, el partit enfronta dos jugadors i hi ha una tercera persona que fa d'àrbitre.

Aquest joc, organitzat com esport, es practica arreu del món. La Federació Internacional (F.I.S.T.F.) és la que s'encarrega de coordinar les diferents associacions o federacions de cada país, a l'hora que coordina l'organització del calendari internacional de competicions.

La part del món amb més jugadors és Europa. Concretament, Bèlgica i Itàlia tenen un nombre molt elevat de practicants.

'''Subbuteo''' is a set of rugby and hockey. The name is most closely associated with the football game, which for many years was marketed as "the replica of Association Football". 

The "Subbuteo" name is derived from the neo-Latin scientific name ''Falco subbuteo'' (a bird of prey commonly known as the Eurasian hobby), after a trademark was not granted to its creator Peter Adolph (1916&ndash;1994) to call the game "Hobby"<ref>The Times: ''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article601725.ece Table-topping star of the big flick-off]''.

==History==

The availability of Subbuteo was first announced in the August 1946 edition of ''The Boy's Own Paper''. The advert was vague and didn't provide any detail about what was actually on offer. The same month Peter Adolph lodged a patent application for the game. Once orders started to pour in, Adolph set about converting his patent idea into a deliverable product. 

The first Subbuteo sets consisted of goals made with wire and paper nets, a cellulose acetate ball, cardboard playing figures in two basic kits (red shirts with white shorts, and blue shirts with white shorts) and bases made from buttons weighed down with lead washers. No pitch was provided: instead, the purchaser was given instructions on how to mark out (with chalk, provided) a playing area onto a blanket (an old army blanket was recommended). The first sets were eventually available about 6 months after the original advertisement appeared. An early innovation was to replace the early cardboard figures with two-dimensional celluloid figures, known to collectors as "flats". 

Early production of Subbuteo was centered in Tunbridge Wells, in Kent. 

In its early years, Subbuteo had a fierce rivalry with Newfooty, a similar game that had been invented in the late 1920s by William Keeling of Liverpool. As a means of differentiating his product, in 1961 Adolph introduced a three-dimensional handpainted plastic figure into the range. After several design modifications, this figure evolved by 1967 into the classic "heavyweight" figure pictured below. 

There were several further evolutions of figure design. In 1978 the "zombie" figure was introduced to facilitate the machine painting of figures. After much negative feedback, the zombie figure was replaced in 1980 by the "lightweight" figure, pictured above, that continued until the 1990s. After England's World Cup victory in 1966, Subbuteo designed a special pack containing all the teams that got further than the group stage, namely quarter-finals and above. This particular set is now difficult to come by and is very expensive. The company was very popular until it suddenly stopped production. The idea was bought by someone however and is now making teams again. Subbuteo also made other things for the collector, such as stands to create a stadium, cups, crowds, police figures and much more.

Playing Subbuteo is a physical simulation of the sport, involving dexterity and skill in flicking the playing pieces, which stand on weighted bases, across the tabletop mat towards the ball, which is oversized and stands nearly as high as the players.

What makes the game different from most other tabletop sports games are the hundreds of team kits and accessories. While most games feature only two teams (usually "red vs blue" or "white vs black"), Subbuteo has several team designs, all for real teams. While some team colours could naturally be used to represent different teams, such as reference 001, which could be used as many teams, including Arsenal, Manchester United and Nottingham Forest, there are many unique kits, such as Sampdoria or Soviet Union, and even unpainted models. There are also many additional accessories, such as new balls and goals, special figures for free kicks and throw-ins, stands and crowd, streakers and policemen, floodlights, and TV cameras.

Subbuteo also has a long-established competitive circuit, where it is known by the term sports table football. There is a world governing body, FISTF, and a World Championship every year.
