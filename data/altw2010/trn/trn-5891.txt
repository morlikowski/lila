سيريل هنشلوود (Cyril Norman Hinshelwood) هو كيميائي و فيزيائي بريطاني ولد في 19 جوان 1897 و توفي في 9 أكتوبر 1967 .

ولد سيريل في لندن و عاش في كندا ثم عاد سنة 1905 عند وفاة والده واستقر في شقة صغيرة في تشيلسي إحدى ضواحي لندن و عاش فيها بقية حياته . درس في مدرسة ويستمينستر و من ثم في معهد باليويل التابع لجامعة أكسفورد .

عمل خلال الحرب العالمية الأولى في معمل متفجرات و أصبح في سنة 1921 مدري الدراسات في معهد ترينيتي و بوفسور كيمياء في جامعة أكسفورد بين 1921 و 1937 كما عمل مستشارا في العلوم للحكومة البرياطنية . انتخب سنة 1929 في المجتمع الملكي و ترأسه بين 1955 و 1960 .

تحصل سنة 1956 مع نيكولاي سيمونوف على جائزة نوبل في الكيمياء لأبحاثهما حول آليات التفاعلات الكيميائية .

}}'''Sir Cyril Norman Hinshelwood''' OM FRS (English physical chemist.

Born in Chelsea where he lived for the rest of his life. He then studied at Westminster City School and Balliol College, Oxford University.

During the First World War, Hinshelwood was a Trinity College from 1921 to 1937 and was Dr Lee’s Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford from 1937. He served on several Advisory Councils on scientific matters to the British Government. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1929, serving as President from 1955 to 1960. He was knighted in 1948 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1960.

His early studies of molecular kinetics led to the publication of ''Thermodynamics for Students of Chemistry'' and ''The Kinetics of Chemical Change'' in 1926. With Harold Warris Thompson he studied the explosive reaction of Hydrogen and Oxygen and described the phenomenon of chain reaction. His subsequent work on chemical changes in the bacterial cell proved to be of great importance in later research work on antibiotics and therapeutic agents, and his book, ''The Chemical Kinetics of the Bacterial Cell'' was published in 1946, followed by ''Growth, Function and Regulation in Bacterial Cells'' in 1966. In 1951 he published ''The Structure of Physical Chemistry''. It was republished as an Oxford Classic Texts in the Physical Sciences by Oxford University Press in 2005.

With Nikolay Semenov of the USSR, Hinshelwood was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1956 for his researches into the mechanism of chemical reactions.

Sir Cyril was President of the Chemical Society and of the Faraday Society, and gained many awards and honorary degrees.

Sir Cyril never married. He was fluent in many languages and his main hobbies were painting, collecting Chinese pottery, and foreign literature. He died, at home, on 9 October, 1967.
