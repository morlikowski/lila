== Characters ==
'''Timothy''' is a raccoon and the 'star' of the show, though many episodes don't involve him.  He is generally a well-meaning young boy, seemingly without any serious character flaws in spite of being an antagonist in a few episodes.  He is a little impulsive however, as seen in "Red Thunder," when he unsuccessfully tries to copy Doris's brothers on a bicycle ramp.  Timothy does not like "Mount Fuji Drops" candy, which were attached to a valentine card he received - which, it turned out, was actually meant for Charles.

Gender: Male<br>
Clothing: Blue and white stripy t-shirt<br>
Likes: Everything about Hilltop School, Yoko<br>
Dislikes: Raisins, When Hilltop School is sad

'''Yoko''' is a Japanese Bobtail from Japan. She is a typical sweet young girl, good at the violin and seeing the best in people. Yoko enjoys many Japanese things such as sushi and origami which has occasionally caused problems for her and her classmates. Her and Timothy are thought to have crushes on each other and are ofter seen standing together. Timothy also spends most of his lunch breaks with Yoko. Yoko does not like "Red Hot Zingers" candy, as they burn her tongue.

Gender: Female<br>
Clothing: Red shirt with yellow skirt<br>
Likes: Japanese stuff, Timothy<br>
Dislikes: When someone is mad

'''Nora''' is a mouse who is somewhat bossy and sulky sometimes. She is known for making a lot of noise which has earned her the nickname Noisy Nora. She owns an iguana called Norman who lives in the school. She has an eight-year old sister named Kate who hasn't appeared in the show other than as a picture Nora drew of her, and an extremely messy baby brother named Jack who occasionally appears.

Gender: Female<br>
Clothing: Purple dress<br>
Likes: Loud music<br>
Dislikes: Being annoyed by her baby brother Jack, big dinosaurs

'''Charles''' is a mouse who is shy and likes to play by himself at recess but is often found around Timothy, Lily or Yoko.  He engages in very creative and imaginative play, as he built a make-believe rocket ship to the stars which included asteroids, stars, and even a black hole made from a tire.  Charles likes "Mount Fuji Drops" candies.

Gender: Male<br>
Clothing: Red shirt with blue dungarees<br>
Likes: Stones and rocks, Timothy<br>
Dislikes: Knocking over his own towers

'''Lily''' is a fox who is forgetful, and to remedy this she often ties a string around a finger. Lily has a pet fish named Treasure. She proves her worth in "Lifesaver Lily" when she rescues a goldfish her class are looking after to stop it freezing to death. She once lost five pieces to a jigsaw puzzle and everyone was really upset with her because she was so silly and forgetful, but these feelings later passed and people managed to get past it. It is thought that Lily and Charles have crushes on each other. The evidence of this is that they both made secret valentines for each other.  Lily likes "Red Hot Zingers" candies, which were attached to the front of the valentine made by Charles, but does not like "Peppermint Hearts", which were on the wrong valentine she received from Timothy, meant for Yoko. 

Gender: Female<br>
Clothing: Orange cardigan, turquoise skirt and red trainers with white laces<br>
Likes: Playing with Charles<br>
Dislikes: Forgetting things, Mustard, Mint (It gives her a tummy-ache.)

'''Frank & Frank''' are the Boston Terrier twin brothers who love sports and often speak in unison. The brothers speak in stilted, dull voices which suggest they are not too bright. They are known for play fighting, telling jokes and their catchphrases such as "Me before you"-- "Me first"-- "ME first"-- "We'll BOTH go first" before both squeezing through a door and their signature jolly laughter.  They hate to be separated as in the episode "Frankless Frank" although they did try something new when they each played with someone different at recess one time (Frank #1 with Fritz and Frank #2 with Timothy) and enjoyed the experience ("Newfound Franks") and sometimes their jokes backfire leading to serious consequences ("Full of Beans"). Their favorite food is franks and beans.

Gender: Both male<br>
Clothing: Frank 1 wears a blue shirt with a white #1 on it, Frank 2 wears a green shirt with a white #2 on it.<br>
Likes: Telling jokes, Running fast<br>
Dislikes: Being separated

'''Doris''' is a beaver who is incredibly boisterous. She is a talented soccer player who seems to have a fear of spiders and caterpillars ("Full of Beans"). Doris has three older brothers: Horace, Morris and Boris.  Doris is clearly the tallest student in her class, though at home, she is teased by her brothers as she is much smaller than they are. Doris appears to be the most avant-garde artist in class, as she believes her painted art doesn't need to look like anything, as long as it makes her happy. Charles is the only other student to share this view, as during a trip to the art museum, the two of them choose to spend time in the modern art part of a museum while the rest of the class choose to return to the classical area. She seemed to have a crush on Timothy in the pilot episode.

Gender: Female (she is a tomboy though.)<br>
Clothing: Deep pink dress with a yellow button and a matching colour bow.<br>
Likes: Sports, Running fast<br>
Dislikes: Spiders and caterpillars 

'''Fritz''' is the badger who is very fond of science and insects. He leaves for another school in one episode and returns soon after. Fritz is also the most clever in the class, and occasionally knows more than the teacher about a particular subject. Fritz reacts poorly to failure, as when his baking-soda rocket zooms around the room uncontrolled he at first gives up trying, and Timothy has to prod him into making another attempt. He was once in hot water in class when he collected leftovers and worms to create a birdhouse for Mrs. Jenkins after she sprained her arm. While Fritz doesn't like to lose things, he seems to be patient towards Lily as seen in the talent show when she kept losing the flowers and found them in time for the show.

Gender: Male<br>
Clothing: Yellow shirt with green jacket<br>
Likes: Lots of interesting things<br>
Dislikes: Losing bits and pieces

'''Juanita''' is the Mexican cat. She resembles Fritz slightly. Upon joining the school, she is very nervous and anxious, but eventually she overcomes her nerves and tells her Mom to go, though she still tells her Mom whenever she might need her. A new pupil to the school, she sees the best in people like Yoko.  She only appears in the two parts comprising episode 26, "Mama, Don't Go" and "Making New Friends."

Gender: Female<br>
Clothing: Yellow shirt with green pinafore.<br>
Likes: Mexican food, Sushi<br>
Dislikes: Not being able to make friends, not having friends.

'''Claude''' is a raccoon who tries to be the best in the school though he comes off arrogant in some cases. Because of this, there is some rivalry between him and Timothy. However, they appear to become good friends after Timothy secretly teaches Claude to swim. After Claude shows off his new skills at the pool and the rest of the class is impressed, Claude makes sure to mention that his teacher was "the best" and he gives Timothy his towel to dry off.

Gender: Male<br>
Clothing: Green shirt<br>
Likes: Saying he's the best, Grace<br>
Dislikes: When he doesn't win

'''Grace''' is an upper-class cat belonging to a very wealthy family. She likes things her way. Her interests include dance, especially ballet, and, as shown in one episode, figure skating. She has a quick temper and gets quickly annoyed when mistakes are made and (to her mind) silly questions asked from others in the class. She is seen playing with Claude most of the time.

Gender: Female<br>
Clothing: Blue dress with white ruffles.<br>
Likes: Pink, Ballet, "Girly" stuff, Strawberries<br>
Dislikes: Horrid stuff, Bad hair days, Mistakes

'''Mrs Jenkins''' is a fox and the teacher of the class. Her name was Miss Abercrombie before she was married to Mr. Jenkins as mentioned in the episode "Just In Time". She can play the piano and she enjoys watching birds.

'''Big Frank''' is the father of Frank and Frank.  He speaks in a gentle voice and sounds much more clever than his sons.  He is seen as good with machinery and repairs, as he is able to easily fix Timothy's bicycle when the front wheel is damaged after attempting a dangerous jump, and also help Frank and Frank fix Yoko's Taketombo after the Franks accidentally break it while playing football in the classroom.

'''Henry''' is the janitor, bus driver and possibly school nurse. He is always cheerful. 

'''Miss Appleberry''', is the class's student teacher.She is a badger like Fritz

There are several notable adults and relatives, though many only appear in a couple of episodes (Yoko's mother, Doris's brothers, and the parents of the other children).
