==Biography==
Juan González was signed by the Texas Rangers as an Puerto Rican comedian Sunshine Logroño. 

In the Puerto Rico youth league, Gonzalez batted cleanup behind future Yankee centerfielder Bernie Williams, where both competed against Gonzalez' future teammate Iván Rodríguez.

==Career in the Major Leagues==
===1986-1990: Minor leagues===
González debuted with the 1986 GCL Rangers and finished with .240 batting average, .303 on-base percentage, and a .266 slugging percentage in 60 games. He only had 5 extra-base hits (none of them home runs) in 233 AB and struck out 57 times. He tied Harvey Pulliam by grounding into a Gulf Coast League-leading 9 double plays.

In , Juan showed some improvement with the AVG, .306 OBP, and .401 slugging percentage with 14 home runs and 74 RBI.

Gonzalez spent  with the Charlotte Rangers and batted .256/~.327/.415 with 8 home runs in 277 AB. Curiously, one of his outfield teammates that year was Sammy Sosa. The next year, he showed more improvement with the Tulsa Drillers hitting .293/~.322/.506 with 21 home runs and led the Texas League with 254 total bases. He outhomered Sosa by 14 and was third in the League in home runs, behind teammate Dean Palmer (25) and Chris Cron (22). Gonzalez was rated the league's #4 prospect by Baseball America, behind Ray Lankford, Andy Benes and Jose Offerman. Lankford and Warren Newson joined him in the TL All-Star outfield. He was called up by the Major League Rangers on September of that year, but only hit .150/.227/.250.

In , González - playing with the Oklahoma City 89ers - led the American Association in home runs (29), RBI (101) and total bases (252). He made the AA All-Star outfield alongside Lankford and Bernard Gilkey and was named the league MVP. Baseball America named him the top prospect in the league in a poll of managers. He finished with .258/~.343/.508 for the 89ers. In the AAA All-Star Game, González hit 4th for the AL prospects and played as a designated hitter. He went 2 for 5 with a double, one of the game's two homers (described as "colossal" by Baseball America), two runs and two RBI in the AL's 8-5 loss. González was again called by the Rangers and did far better this time, batting .289/.316/.522.

===1991-1999: Glory days in Texas===
In , González became a regular starter for the Rangers at age 21, hitting .264 with 27 HR and 102 RBI, almost duplicating his prior year in Oklahoma City. González came up as a center fielder, as did teammate Sammy Sosa; but the Rangers opted to keep González and trade Sosa. Gonzalez eventually settled into right field, where he had a decent arm and adequate speed, but never looked entirely comfortable fielding fly balls and extra-base hits.

In , he was the American League home-run champion with 43, one more than Mark McGwire. He also finished with a .260 batting average and a .529 slugging percentage winning the first of six Silver Slugger awards. The next year, he finished first again in home runs with 46, edging Ken Griffey, Jr. by one. He also improved his batting average and slugging percentage to .310 and .632 respectively. 

That year, he was selected for the first time to the All-Star Game with 7. He also finished fourth in voting for the 1993 AL MVP. He led the 1993 AL in slugging percentage winning his second Silver Slugger award.

In , the Rangers moved from The Ballpark at Arlington. The new park was designed to benefit left-handed hitters, whereas González was right-handed. This could've been one of the reasons why he struggled in the 1994 and 1995 seasons with his average and home run totals declining. He batted only 19 and 27 home runs respectively. Also, González struggled with injuries that limited his playing time. Also, during the 1995 season, González mostly settled in the designated hitter position because of injuries.

By the next year, González seemed to have figured how to play at the new Rangers ballpark and ended up averaging more than one RBI per game for a three-year span (1996-98). He won two New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract listed him as the player who had the highest ratio of slugging percentage to on-base percentage in baseball history at that time, ahead of Dave Kingman and Tony Armas and 4th in RBI per game by an outfielder (behind Sam Thompson, Joe DiMaggio and Babe Ruth). James also ranked González as the 52nd-best right fielder in baseball history as of mid-2000.

In , González had one of his best seasons hitting .314 with a .643 slugging percentage. He edged Alex Rodríguez by one first-place vote (11-10) and 3 award points (290-287) in a very close voting to win the American League MVP. He won his third Silver Slugger as an OF and was second in the AL in slugging (87 points behind McGwire). That year, the Texas Rangers made the playoffs, and in the 1996 American League Division Series, González homered five times in four games and batted .438/.526/1.375 with 9 RBI. However, Texas was still defeated by the New York Yankees. González tied Jeffrey Leonard's 1987 NLCS record by homering in four straight post-season games and joined Reggie Jackson and Ken Griffey, Jr. as the only players to hit five home runs in a single post-season series.  Juan's cumulative 1996 stats (playoffs included) are pretty hefty:  In 138 total games, he had 557 AB, 94 R, 177 H, 33 2B, 2 3B, 52 HR, 153 RBI, and 48 BB with a 10.7 AB/HR ratio.

In , Juan batted .296/.335/.589 as a DH-RF for the Rangers. Gonzalez won his fourth Silver Slugger. In 133 games he was 4th in slugging, 6th in total bases (314), third in homers (42) and RBI (131), 10th in extra-base hits (69) and tied for 6th with 10 sacrifice flies.

In , he reached the 100 RBI mark before the All-Star break (101), being the first player (and still most recent) to do so since Division Series.

In , he was 9th in the AL in average, 4th in slugging, 6th in OPS, 10th in runs (114), 6th in total bases (338), 6th in home runs (39), 5th in RBI (128), 7th in extra-base hits (76) and 2nd in sacrifice flies (12), one behind Roberto Alomar. However, he ended up struggling again in the Division Series, hitting only .182/.250/.455 with one homer as Texas was swept by New York for the second straight season. The only run the Rangers scored in the series was the homer by González.

González's four-year peak, not coincidentally, aligned with the first (and to date, only) three postseason appearances in the Rangers' history. He also contributed greatly to the Indians' 2001 division championship.

===2000-2001: Detroit and Cleveland===
In November 2, , he was traded by the Rangers with Danny Patterson and Gregg Zaun to the Detroit Tigers in exchange of Frank Catalanotto, Francisco Cordero, Bill Haselman, Gabe Kapler, Justin Thompson, and Minor League prospect Alan Webb.

González struggled with Comerica Park and with new injuries on his back and leg. He hit .289/.337/.505 and did not rank among the league leaders in anything. He spurned a 8 year, $140 Million deal from the Tigers because of a desire to go to a friendlier ballpark for right-handed hitters. 

On January 9, , he signed with the 2001 All-Star Game.  Gonzalez hit .347 with 23 HR 83 RBI in 79 games (.640 SLG% / 1.031 OPS%) in the first half.
