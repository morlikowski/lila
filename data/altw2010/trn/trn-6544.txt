『'''どですかでん'''』は、黒澤明監督の映画作品。原作は、山本周五郎の『季節のない街』。黒澤映画初のカラー作品である。

『赤ひげ』以来、5年ぶりの監督作品。この間、『トラ・トラ・トラ!』の監督降板騒動などで神経を削ったこともあってか、本作ではそれまでの三船敏郎とのコンビによる重厚な作品路線から一転、貧しくも精一杯生きている小市民の日常を明るいタッチで描いている。しかしながら、当時の興行成績は明らかな失敗で、以降、黒澤は『デルス・ウザーラ』を挟んで10年間にわたって日本映画界の中心から遠ざかることになる。

なお、企画・製作にある「四騎の会」とは、黒澤、木下惠介、市川崑、小林正樹の4人からなる芸術家集団で、邦画低迷の時代に4人の力を合わせてこれを打開しようとの意図で結成されたが、うまく機能せず、製作映画は本作と『化石』（1975年、小林正樹監督）に留まった。

 is a film by Akira Kurosawa set in a Japanese rubbish dump in the period immediately following World War II.  The film focuses lives of a variety of characters who happen to live in a dump. The first one introduced is a mentally retarded boy who pretends to be a tram conductor by following a set route through the dump in an imaginary tram that he mimes.  The film title refers to a traditional Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound made by a tram or train while in motion ( "Do-desu-ka-den do-desu-ka-den do-desu-ka-den"). The sound is made by the boy as he makes his daily faux-tram route through the dump. Dodesukaden was filmed on an actual dump in Tokyo. 

This was Kurosawa's first color film, and he took full of advantage of the new color medium. After the success of ''Red Beard'', it took Kurosawa five years before this film appeared. None of the actors from Kurosawa's stock company of the 1950's and 60's were in this film and most of the cast were relatively unknown.  Dodesukaden was unlike anything that Kurosawa had made before, and was critically panned in Japan despite earning an Academy Award Nomination for Best Foreign Film in 1970.  Dodesukaden was Kurosawa's first financial failure and came during the worst possible time in his life.  When Dodesukaden was filmed Kurosawa had been going through a lull in his career and personal life - he was finding it increasingly difficult to obtain finance despite the critical and financial success of his previous films, and rumors about his deteriorating mental health only made matters worse.  Dodesukaden was only made by the cooperation and co-producing of three other Japanese directors, Kinoshita, Kobayashi, and Ichikawa.  

The critical failure of Dodesukaden sent Kurosawa into a deep depression, and in 1971 he attempted suicide. Despite having slashed himself over 30 times with a razor, Kurosawa survived his suicide; however, he would not return to filmmaking for five years, releasing ''Dersu Uzala'' in 1975. This won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, the only Academy Award that Kurosawa received for a single film.
