'''Franco Battiato''' (born Italian singer-songwriter, composer, filmmaker and (as '''Süphan Barzani''') painter.

He is considered one of the most original personalities in Italian music from the 1970s to now. Together with Alice, Franco Battiato represented Italy at the esoteric, philosophical and East Asian religious themes.

His collaborations (from 1994 onward) with the nihilistic-cynical philosopher anarchistic and problematic thinkers. 

==Biography==
===Early years and experimental period===
'''Francesco Battiato''' was born in Jonia di Riposto, in the province of Catania (Sicily).

At the age of 20 he moved to Osage Tribe, an Italian psychedelic-progressive rock band. As a solo artist, he released the science-fiction single "La convenzione" ("The convention"), one of the finest Italian progressive rock songs of the 1970s.

Starting from 1971, Battiato devoted much of his efforts to experimental minimalism: ''Fetus'' (1971, whose cover was censored), ''Pollution'' (1972), ''Sulle Corde di Aries'' (1973), ''Clic'' (1974) and ''M.lle Le Gladiator'' (1975). ''Clic'' is a haunting yet largely conventional exploration in the eletronic style reminiscent of Phillip Glass and even German experimental rock band Can.

In 1975, he moved to the Dischi Ricordi label, producing ''Battiato'' (1975), ''Juke Box'' (1976) and the experimental ''L'Egitto prima delle sabbie'' ("Egypt Before the Sands", 1977), which won the Stockhausen award for contemporary music.

===National success===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: thumb|''La voce del padrone'' was the first Italian album to sell more than 1,000,000 copies, and launched Battiato as a star of the music industry. -->
After having been fired by Ricordi, Battiato signed a contract for EMI. Largely, though not wholly, abandoning the experiments of the early years, he moved to a more pop-oriented style which afforded him ever increasing popularity with Italian audiences. In this period his albums were usually in collaboration with the renowned musician and violinist Giusto Pio, whose two later albums were produced by Battiato. 

After ''L'era del cinghiale bianco'' ("The Era of the White Boar") 1979 and ''Patriots'' (1980), Battiato obtained astounding success with ''La voce del padrone'' ("The Master's Voice") in 1981, which was the first Italian LP to sell more than one million copies. The commercial success was confirmed by ''L'arca di Noè'' ("Noah's Ark") in 1982. Songs like "L'era del cinghiale bianco", "Prospettiva Nevskij" ("Nevsky Prospekt"), "Centro di gravità permanente" ("Constant Centre of Gravity"), "Bandiera bianca" ("White Flag"), "Voglio vederti danzare" ("I Want to See You Dancing"<!--the title is taken from the English version in ''Echoes of Sufi Dances'' LP-->), with their original mix of Oriental and philosophical fashions with pop rhythms, established Battiato's status as one of the most capable and intelligent musicians in Italy. Many of the songs of this era contained parts in English and, most of all, Arab, a language that Battiato had started to study after a trip to Turkey. Battiato's albums were also published in Spanish and English versions.

''Orizzonti perduti'' ("Lost Horizons") 1983, which Battiato himself called "a kipper", was followed by the successful ''Mondi lontanissimi'' ("Most Distant Worlds", 1985), which featured a solo version of the popular "I treni di Tozeur" ("The Trains of Tozeur), originally a duet with Alice performed at the 1984 Eurovision Song Contest, the science-fiction/metaphysical "Via Lattea" ("Milky Way") and "No Time No Space".

More than 300,000 copies of 1988's ''Fisiognomica'' (Physiognomic) sold, confirmed Battiato's status. It contained the song "Nomadi" ("Nomads"), written by his old friend Camisasca, who in the meantime had retired to a Franciscan convent. One of the songs on the album was performed by director/actor Nanni Moretti in his 1989 movie ''Palombella Rossa''.

''Come un cammello su una grondaia''  ("Like a Camel in a Gutter") 1991, was divided into two parts, the second made up by classical German lieder. Among the pop songs, "Povera patria" ("My Poor Father Land"), a poetical denouncement of Italy's lack of culture and honesty, became a kind of hymn of the civil society rebelling against the mafioso attempts of the following year against judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino.

Pio and Battiato also worked as producers for several singers, including Alice and Giuni Russo, and for two of Milva's albums. 

Starting from 1987, Battiato also produced several classical operas: ''Genesi'' (1987), ''Gilgamesh'' (1992) and ''Il Cavaliere dell'Intelletto'' (1994). In 1990 he also began to experiment with painting, initially under the pseudonym of Süphan Barzani.

===Collaboration with Manlio Sgalambro===
In 1994 Battiato began to collaborate with the Sicilian philosopher Manlio Sgalambro, who was to write almost all the lyrics of his following albums.

'''Franco Battiato''' (* italienischer Liedermacher, Musiker, Maler (unter dem Pseudonym 'Süphan Barzani') und Regisseur.

Battiato gilt als eine der herausragenden Persönlichkeiten der italienischen Musik von den 1970er Jahren bis heute. Seine Musik zeichnet sich durch immer wieder neue Musikstile aus, so dass er keiner Musikrichtung fest zuzuordnen ist.
1984 vertrat er zusammen mit Alice Italien beim Eurovision Song Contest mit dem Lied ''I treni di Tozeur''.

Battiatos Musik ist oft sehr eigenwillig, mit Texten, die häufig keinerlei Sinn zu ergeben scheinen und so ein wenig dadaistisch wirken.

Seine Zusammenarbeit mit dem Philosophen Manlio Sgalambro hat den Texten Tiefe mit oft versteckten Verweisen auf Werke von Emile Cioran, Friedrich Nietzsche und anderen gegeben.
