'''Selbstjustiz''' bezeichnet das außergesetzliche Vorgehen von nicht dazu Berufenen gegen eine strafbar. Der Staat behält sich das Recht der Bestrafung als Dritter selbst vor. Daher wird das Pendant der Selbstjustiz auch als „Fremdjustiz“ bezeichnet.

Als Rechtfertigung für einen Akt der Selbstjustiz vorgebracht wird meist das Versagen der Justiz oder deren Unfähigkeit, gegen die als verbrecherisch empfundene Handlung effektiv, schnell oder überhaupt vorzugehen.

Nicht unter die Definition der Selbstjustiz fallen solche Handlungen, die von der Rechtsordnung nach den Grundsätzen der Selbsthilfe, der Notwehr oder zur Abwendung eines Notstandes erfolgen. Ebenso wenig wird der Begriff der Selbstjustiz auf Handlungsformen im Rahmen eines möglicherweise billigenswerten Widerstandsrechtes gebraucht.

== Vigilantismus ==
Aus dem angelsächsischen Sprachraum wandert in den heutigen deutschen Sprachgebrauch der Ausdruck '''Vigilantismus''' (von lat. ''vigilans'' 'wachsam') für eine systemstabilisierende und somit meist konservative Selbstjustiz. Viele dieser Gruppen engagieren sich in Bereichen, wo es ihrer Meinung nach keine ausreichende institutionelle Unterstützung des Rechts gibt. Es handelt sich der häufigsten Deutung nach um rechte Milizen oder Polizeigruppen, die das Gesetz gleichsam „in die eigenen Hände nehmen“. Vigilanten operieren häufig als geheime Verschwörer. 

In den Goldrausch von 1849 in Montana verbreitet, sowie während der Arbeitslosigkeit zwischen den Weltkriegen. Der Vigilantismus brach auch in anderen Landesteilen aus und endete häufig in der Lynchjustiz gegenüber verdächtigten Personen oder erkannten Verbrechern. Nicht alle Aktivitäten waren nur vorübergehend. Im 19. Jahrhundert gab es in Amerika zahlreiche gut organisierte Vigilanzkomitees. 

Selbstjustiz ist gesetzlich verboten, weil der Staat auf Basis seines Gewaltmonopols sich das alleinige Recht vorbehält, Bestrafungen ausschließlich im Rahmen des Rechtssystems durch die Justiz (Richter und Staatsanwalt) auszusprechen.

A '''vigilante''' is a person who ignores authorities. Several groups and individuals have been labeled as vigilantes by various historians and media. Vigilantes have been central to several creative fictional works and are often depicted as being heroes and retaliatory against wrongdoers.

==Etymology==

The term ''vigilante'' is Spanish and Portuguese for "watchman" or "watcher," ultimately from Latin "vigilans"- the present participle of "vigilare" (to watch).  Its etymology is closely related to (though its meaning very different from) that of the term ''vigilance''.  Note that the term ''vigilantism'' is a derivative of ''vigilante'', not of ''vigilant'' or ''vigilance''.  The term ''vigilante'' was introduced into English from the official agencies (who would otherwise encourage vigilance on the part of citizens), especially when it gives way to criminal behavior on the part of the vigilante.

==Vigilante behavior==

An subjective definition of vigilantism.

"Vigilante justice" is sometimes spurred on by the perception that social demand.  Most significantly, some vigilantes specifically target authoritarian entities such as government.
 
Persons seen as escaping from the law, or "above the law" are sometimes the targets of vigilantism.<ref></ref> It may target persons or organizations involved in illegal activities in general or it may be aimed against a specific group or type of activity, e.g. police corruption.  Other times, governmental corruption is the prime target of vigilante freedom fighters.

Vigilante behavior may differ in degree of violence. In some cases vigilantes may assault targets verbally, terrorize victims, perform inhumane acts, or may exhibit no violence at all, choosing other means of pressuring the target.  Anyone who defies government and institution to further justice can be considered a vigilante, and thus violence is not a necessary criterion.

==History==
Vigilantism existed long before the word ''vigilante'' was introduced into the English language.  In the Western literary and cultural tradition, characteristics of ''vigilantism'' have often been noted in folkloric heroes and legendary outlaws (e.g., Robin Hood<ref></ref>). Vigilantism in literature, folklore and legend is deeply connected to the fundamental issues of morality, the nature of justice, the limits of bureaucratic authority and the ethical function of legitimate governance.

During medieval times, punishment of felons was sometimes exercised by such secret societies as the courts of the Vehm (cf. the medieval Sicilian Vendicatori), a type of early vigilante organization, which became extremely powerful in Westphalian Germany during the 15th century.

===Colonial era===
Formally-defined vigilantism arose in the early corruption of a legitimate government and vindicate moral ends) was not clear.

*Established the mid-18th century, for instance, the Regulator movement of American colonial times was composed of citizen volunteers of the frontier who opposed official misconduct and extrajudicially punished banditry.

*In the aftermath of the Civil War and the South's defeat, vigilante secret societies, such as the Ku Klux Klan, which hid behind masks and robes, and the Knights of the White Camellia, arose, using violence and intimidation to continue an insurgent war, enforce white supremacy against freedmen, and to intimidate white Republicans and Freedmen's Bureau agents. With state and Federal enforcement, both died out about 1870-1871.
