Wake Forest, near the state capital Raleigh, the Reynolda Campus, the university's main campus, is located north of downtown  Winston-Salem.  The Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center campus is located nearby. The University also occupies lab space at the Bowman Gray Technical Center, at the downtown Piedmont Research Park, and at the Center for Nanotechnology and Molecular Materials.

==History==
Calvin Jones in an area north of Raleigh (Wake County) called the "Forest of Wake." The new school, designed to teach both Baptist ministers and laymen, opened on 3 February 1834 as the Wake Forest Manual Labor Institute, so called because students and staff were required to spend half of each day doing manual labor on the plantation. Dr. Samuel Wait, a Baptist minister, was selected as the "principal", later president, of the institute. [http://www.wfu.edu/history/HST_WFU/perry.html]

In 1839, it was renamed Wake Forest College, and the manual labor system was abandoned. The town that grew up around the college came to be called the town of Wake Forest. In 1862, during the Charles Taylor. In 1894, the School of Law was established, followed by the School of Medicine in 1902. The university held its first summer session in 1921.

The leading college figure in the early 20th century was Dr. William L. Poteat, a gifted biologist and the first layman to be elected president in the College’s history. “Dr. Billy” continued to promote growth, hired many outstanding professors, and expanded the science curriculum. He also stirred upheaval among North Carolina Baptists with his strong support of teaching the theory of evolution but eventually won formal support from the Baptist State Convention for academic freedom at the College.

The School of Medicine moved to Winston-Salem (then North Carolina's second-largest city) in 1941 and became the Bowman Gray School of Medicine. The following year, 1942, Wake Forest admitted its first female undergraduate students, after World War II dramatically depleted the pool of male students.

In 1946, as a result of large gifts from the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation, the entire college agreed to move to Winston-Salem, a move that was completed for the beginning of the fall 1956 term. Charles and Mary Babcock (daughter of R. J. Reynolds) donated the college about  of fields and woods at "Reynolda", their estate.<ref></ref> From 1952 to 1956, fourteen new buildings were constructed on the new campus.<ref name="autogenerated1">The Undergraduate Schools: Bulletin of Wake Forest University 2007-2008</ref> These buildings were constructed in Georgian style.<ref name="autogenerated1" />The old campus in Wake Forest was sold to the Baptist State Convention to establish the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary.

In 1986, Wake Forest gained autonomy from the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina and established a fraternal relationship with it.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

A graduate studies program was inaugurated in 1961, and in 1967 the school became the fully accredited Wake Forest University. The Babcock Graduate School of Management was established in 1969. The James R. Scales Fine Arts Center opened in 1979. In 1995, the business school was renamed the Wayne Calloway School of Business and Accountancy, while in 1997 the medical school was renamed the Wake Forest University School of Medicine. A divinity school was added in 1999. [http://divinity.wfu.edu/about.html]

The thirteenth president of Wake Forest is Nathan O. Hatch, former provost at the University of Notre Dame. Hatch was officially installed as president on 20 October 2005. He assumed office on 1 July 2005, succeeding Thomas K. Hearn, Jr., who had retired after twenty-two years in office.

==Academics==
In the past 20 years, the university has produced 11 Rhodes Scholars [http://www.wfu.edu/news/release/2006.11.19.m.php] and numerous Marshall and Fulbright recipients.

===Undergraduate===
Wake Forest's undergraduate component consists of Wake Forest College (school of arts and science) and the Wayne Calloway School of Business and Accountancy. The university offers 34 majors and many interdisciplinary minors across various fields of study. In order to attend the Wayne Calloway School, students must make a special application to its program. The Calloway School offers a 5 year accountancy program whereby a student earns a BS and an MS in Accountancy and qualifies to sit for the CPA exam after 5 years of combined undergraduate and graduate study.

In order to graduate, a Wake Forest student must finish a basic set of classes and a set of divisional classes. The basic set of classes includes a first year seminar, a writing seminar, health and PE classes, and foreign language literature. The latter usually requires students to take additional languages classes first. Languages available include Spanish, French, German, Latin, Greek, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, and others.

About 89% of Wake Forest professors hold the terminal degree in their field. Wake Forest professors are expected to excel in both teaching and scholarship.

Wake Forest offers a number of study abroad programs for its undergraduates and, in the summers, for its law school students. About half of Wake Forest undergraduates spend at least one semester abroad.

==Student life==
===Fraternities and sororities ===
Wake Forest's undergraduate social scene is heavily influenced by Greek life. However, fraternities and sororities are highly integrated to both each other and independents, socially speaking. Greek social events are generally open to all students, Greek and non-Greek. Wake Forest's Greek life is unusual in that the Greeks do not have houses concentrated in a "Greek Row". Instead Greeks occupy lounges and their adjoining halls of a greater building. These areas are spread out evenly across campus, with the exception of Delta Kappa Epsilon, which has its residence off campus. Wake Forest has a deferred rush process, whereby freshman rush their second semester, giving them a semester's time to become acquainted to new friends and the school. Upperclassmen are permitted to rush both in the fall and the spring. Though most Greeks pledged their freshman year, it is not uncommon for students to pledge during an upperclassmen year (predominantly sophomore year).

===Physical activity options===
Wake Forest offers a vast array of possibilities for physical activity be it for recreation or health. The University offers classes in Yoga, Dance, Boot Camp, etc. In addition, some classes are offered for credit on sports theory and practice, as well as several dance courses. Intramural Sports are also extremely popular and take place for a variety of sports, depending on the season.

===Dining facilities===
Every Wake Forest undergraduate student is required to sign up for a meal plan in coordination with Subway is also located on campus, off Hearn Plaza.

Recently, in the fall of 2005, Aramark, through its Fresh Foods Company, renovated "The Pit" in an attempt to improve the quality of the dining experience. The newly renovated area contains a variety a food stations with a "cooked upon order" service.

===Student media===
*[http://radio.wfu.edu/ WAKE Radio] is a student run internet radio station. Students regularly broadcast shows ranging from political talk to underground indie music hours.
*[http://student.wfu.edu/ The Student] is a student run website created and run by students to help integrate the student body to academic activities and social events around campus and the Winston-Salem area.
*Wake Forest University's school newspaper is the [http://ogb.wfu.edu/ Old Gold & Black] (OGB), named for the school's colors. Published weekly from an office in Benson University Center, the Old Gold & Black is produced by a group of student editors, reporters and photographers.
*The school television channel is Wake-TV. Its feature television show is the weekly edition Wake-TV News. ''Sportsline'' is another popular show among students, where callers can ask the hosts questions about sports.
*The Howler is the annual yearbook.
*[http://3to4&nbsp;ounces.wfu.edu/ Three to Four Ounces] is the only official literary magazine on campus, publishing a collection of original student poetry, prose, and art each semester. It is also the longest-running media outlet on campus, as it began in 1882 as The Student when the school was still known as Wake Forest College [http://wakestudent.com/about/].
*[http://3to4&nbsp;ounces.wfu.edu/NOTICE/index.html Notice] is a student-made magazine funded by Three to Four Ounces and designed to enlighten the students of Wake Forest about the creative people surrounding them. The project's intent is to celebrate and encourage creativity on campus in visual arts, music, writing, or any provocative form of expression.

===Undergraduate student housing===
Wake Forest undergraduate students are guaranteed on-campus housing for four years. For their freshman and sophomore years, students are required to live on campus. There are five areas within the Reynolda campus where all the undergraduate dormitories are located: South Campus, North Campus, Palmer/Piccolo, Polo Townhouse/Student Apartments/Martin, and the Polo Road Houses. All student housing has air-conditioning, closets, wired/wireless internet access, and unlimited washer/dryer usage. Every residence hall is equipped with at least one communal lounge area (with a big-screen television, sometimes a ping-pong table) and kitchen area. Student housing in Polo offers two-bedroom apartment-style living and four bedroom, two bathroom townhouse-style living, complete with furnished bedrooms, living room, and dining room furniture.

Freshman housing includes dorms Collins, Babcock, Luter, Bostwick, Johnson, Palmer and Piccolo. Johnson Hall is the "substance free" dorm where most residents must sign an agreement to not use alcohol, tobacco or any other mind altering substance. Recently, Johnson hall has been used for housing overflow, and students who sign no agreement have been placed there.

===Student union===
The event-planning arm of Wake Forest is undergraduate student led and run organization known as Student Union. Student union projects include such events as Homecoming, Family Weekend, Special Lectures, and Events at the Coffeehouse.

Their most celebrated and well attended event is the annual "Shag on the Mag" that occurs on the Manchester Quad. A big tent that covers the entire quad is laid out and students shag dance together.

===Student government===
Wake Forest Student Government (known as SG) works under a semi-Presidential system.

The core component is the General Assembly, which acts as a student legislature. The General Assembly is made up of legislators, represented and voted by each residence hall. The legislators are assigned within one of six committees to specialize in a particular area of student needs.

===Presidential debates===
Twice the school has hosted presidential debates. The first, between then-Vice President George H.W. Bush and Governor Michael Dukakis, took place in Wait Chapel on 25 September 1988. The second matched then-Governor George W. Bush against Vice President Al Gore on 11 October 2000.

==Athletics==

Originally, Wake Forest's athletic teams were known as the Fighting Baptists, due to its association with the Baptist Convention (from which it later separated itself). However, in 1923, after a particularly impressive win against the Duke Blue Devils, a newspaper reporter wrote that the Deacons "fought like Demons", giving rise to the current team name, the "'''Demon Deacons'''".

Wake Forest has won a total of eight national championships in four different sports; four of these championships have come in the past six years. Wake Forest is sometimes referred to as being a part of "Duke, North Carolina, and North Carolina State, as well as Wake Forest.

The Demon Deacons participate in the NCAA's Division I (in the Bowl Subdivision for football) and in the Atlantic Coast Conference.

The Athletics Director is Ron Wellman.

===Football===

'''2006 Season'''

Wake Forest's football team was ranked in the Top 25 in the nation by the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets 9-6 on Orange Bowl to play the Big East champion Louisville Cardinals, where they lost 24-13. However, this made Wake Forest the smallest school to ever compete in the Rice and Tulsa have smaller undergraduate enrollments, and Wake has the smallest undergraduate enrollment of any school in the BCS conferences.

For his part in the record-setting season, coach Jim Grobe was unanimously selected ACC Coach of the Year, and handily won the AP Coach of the Year award several weeks later. Coach Grobe signed a ten-year contract in 2003.
