In English, the infinitive of a verb is its basic form with or without the particle ''to'': therefore, ''do'' and ''to do'', ''be'' and ''to be'', and so on are infinitives. As with many linguistic concepts, there is not a single definition of ''infinitive'' that applies to all languages; however, in languages that have infinitives, they generally have most of the following properties:

*In most of their uses, infinitives are non-finite verbs.
*They function as other lexical categories — usually nouns — within the clauses that contain them, for example by serving as the subject of another verb.
*They do not represent any of the verb's arguments (as ''employer'' and ''employee'' do).
*They are not inflected to agree with any subject, and their subject, if they have one, is not case-marked as such.
*They cannot serve as the only verb of a declarative sentence.
*They are the verb's lemma, citation form, and/or ''name''; that is, they are regarded as its basic uninflected form, and/or they are used in giving its definition or conjugation.
*They do not have tense, aspect, moods, and/or voice, or they are limited in the range of tenses, aspects, moods, and/or voices that they can use. (In languages where infinitives do not have moods at all, they are usually treated as being their own non-finite mood.)
*They are used with auxiliary verbs.

However, it bears repeating that none of the above is a defining quality of the infinitive; infinitives do not have all these properties in every language, as it is shown below, and other verb forms may have one or more of them. For example, English gerunds and participles have most of these properties as well.

==Infinitives in English==

English has three non-finite verbal forms, but by long-standing convention, the term "infinitive" is applied to only one of these. (The other two are the past- and present-particle ''to''. When this particle is absent, the infinitive is said to be a ''bare infinitive''; when it is present, it is generally considered to be a part of the infinitive, then known as the ''full infinitive'' (or ''to-infinitive''), and there is a controversy about whether it should be separated from the main word of the infinitive. (''See'' constituent, instead taking the particle ''to'' to operate on an entire verb phrase; so, ''to buy a car'' is parsed as ''to {buy {a car}}'', not as ''{to buy} {a car}''.

The bare infinitive and the full infinitive are in complementary distribution. They are not generally interchangeable, but the distinction does not generally affect the meaning of a sentence; rather, certain contexts call almost exclusively for the bare infinitive, and all other contexts call for the full infinitive.

Huddleston and Pullum's recent ''Cambridge Grammar of the English Language'' (CGEL) does not use the notion of the ''infinitive'', arguing that English uses the same form of the verb, the ''plain form'', in infinitival clauses that it uses in imperative and present-subjunctive clauses.

===Uses of the bare infinitive===

The bare infinitive is used in a rather limited number of contexts, but some of these are quite common:

*The bare infinitive is used as the main verb after the dummy auxiliary verb ''do'', or any modal auxiliary verb (such as ''will'', ''can'', or ''should''), except that ''ought'' usually takes a to-infinitive. So, "I will/do/can/etc. '''see''' it."
*Several common verbs of perception, including ''see'', ''watch'', ''hear'', ''feel'', and ''sense'' take a direct object and a bare infinitive, where the bare infinitive indicates an action taken by the main verb's direct object. So, "I saw/watched/heard/etc. it '''happen'''." (A similar meaning can be effected by using the present participle instead: "I saw/watched/heard/etc. it '''happening'''." The difference is that the former implies that the entirety of the event was perceived, while the latter implies that part of the progress of the event was perceived.)
*Similarly with several common verbs of permission or causation, including ''make'', ''bid'', ''let'', and ''have''. So, "I made/bade/let/had him '''do''' it." (However, ''make'' takes a to-infinitive in the passive voice: "I was made '''to do''' it.")
*The bare infinitive is the dictionary form of a verb, and is generally the form of a verb that receives a definition; however, the definition itself generally uses a to-infinitive. So, "The word <nowiki>'</nowiki>'''amble'''<nowiki>'</nowiki> means 'to walk slowly.'"
*The bare infinitive form is also the present subjunctive form and the imperative form, although most grammarians do not consider uses of the present subjunctive or imperative to be uses of the bare infinitive.

===Uses of the full infinitive===

The full infinitive  (or to-infinitive) is used in a great many different contexts:

*Outside of dictionary headwords, it is the most commonly used citation form of the English verb: "How do we conjugate the verb ''to go''?"
*It can be used like a noun phrase, expressing its action or state in an abstract, general way. So, "'''To err''' is human"; "'''To know''' me is '''to love me'''".  (However, a gerund is often preferred for this — "'''Being''' is '''doing'''" would be more natural than the abstract and philosophical sounding "'''To be''' is '''to do'''."<ref>[http://englishpage.com/gerunds/part_1.htm English Page - Gerunds and Infinitives Part 1] [sic]</ref>)
*It can be used like an adjective or adverb, expressing purpose or intent. So, "The letter says I'm '''to wait outside'''", or "He is the man '''to talk to'''", or "<nowiki>[In order]</nowiki> '''to meditate''', one must free one's mind."
*In either of the above uses, it can often be given a subject using the preposition ''for'': "'''For him to fail now''' would be a great disappointment"; "<nowiki>[In order]</nowiki> '''for you to get there on time''', you'll need to leave now." (The former sentence could also be written, "His failing now would be a great disappointment.")
*It can be used after many intransitive verbs; in this case, it generally has the subject of the main verb as its implicit subject. So, "I agreed '''to leave'''", or "He failed '''to make''' his case." (This may be considered a special case of the noun-like use above.) With some verbs the infinitive may carry a significantly different meaning from a gerund: compare ''I stopped to talk to her'' with ''I stopped talking to her'', or ''I forgot to buy the bread'' with ''I forgot buying the bread''.
*It can be used after the direct objects of many transitive verbs; in this case, it generally has the direct object of the main verb as its implicit subject. So, "I convinced him '''to leave''' with me", or "He asked her '''to make''' his case on his behalf."
*As a special case of the above, it can often be used after an intransitive verb, together with a subject using the preposition ''for'': "I arranged '''for him to accompany''' me", or "I waited '''for summer to arrive'''."

When the verb is implied, some dialects will reduce the to-infinitive to simply ''to'': "Do I have '''to'''?"

===The infinitive with auxiliary verbs===

The auxiliary verb ''do'' does not have an infinitive — even though ''do'' is also a main verb and in that sense is often used in the infinitive. One does not say *''I asked to do not have to'', but rather, either ''I asked not to have to'' or ''I asked to not have to'' (but ''see'' split infinitive). Similarly, one cannot emphasize an infinitive using ''do''; one cannot say, "I hear him do say it all the time."

Nonetheless, the auxiliary verbs ''have'' (used to form the perfect aspect) and ''be'' (used to form the passive voice and continuous aspect) both commonly appear in the infinitive: "It's thought '''to have''' been a ceremonial site", or "I want '''to be''' doing it already."

'''"Impersonal future"'''

There is a specific situation in which the infinitive is used, where it acts almost like an "impersonal future tense", replacing "will". This is done through the construction:
::''to be'' + "to" + bare infinitive
Grammatically, this is identical to the instructional "I am to wait outside" construction (above), but ''does not'' signify somebody having been issued an instruction; rather, it expresses an intended action, in the same way as "will". This "tense" is used extensively in news reports, eg. –
* The Prime Minister is to visit the West Bank (active)
* Aid is to be sent to war-torn Darfur (passive)

This future tense is "impersonal" in that, in the phrase "John will go", for example, the speaker is almost advocating their certainty that John will, in fact, go; instead, the "John is to go" construction simply states the '''''knowledge''''' that John's going is in some way foreseen (If John does not go, the "will go" construction is negated, while the "to go" construction still holds true, since all it expresses is an ''expectation'').

===Defective verbs===

The defective in that they do not have infinitives; so, one cannot say, *''I want him to can do it'', but rather must say, ''I want him to be able to do it''. The periphrases ''to be able to'', ''to have to'' and ''to be going to'' are generally used in these cases.

=== Impersonal Constructions ===

There is a specific situation in which the infinitive is used, where it acts almost like an "impersonal future tense", replacing "will". This is done through the construction:
::''to be'' + "''to''" + bare infinitive
Grammatically, this is identical to the instructional "I am to wait outside" construction (above), but ''does not'' signify somebody having been issued an instruction; rather, it expresses an intended action, in the same way as "will". This "tense" is used extensively in news reports, eg. –
* ''The Prime Minister is to visit the West Bank'' (active)
* ''Aid is to be sent to war-torn Darfur'' (passive) '''<ref>In headlines, the verb ''to be'' is entirely omitted - eg. ''Prime Minister to visit...; Aid to be sent...,'' etc.</ref>'''

This "future infinitive" construction is interesting in that it only has a future aspect to it in situations where the speaker is significantly distanced from the event.<ref>Grammar books on English simply do not deal with this tense due to its extreme rarity, hence why it has no official name .</ref> In cases where the subject of the sentence is not quite as distanced from the speaker, then the same construction takes on a sense of '''''instruction''''' or '''''necessity''''' (as in "he is to wait outside", or "he is to go to hospital").

The same construction can be used in conditional clauses - ''If you are to go on holiday, then you need to work hard'' (or, conversely, ''if you want to...then you are to...'').

:: * * *
The impersonality aspect comes from the fact that the emotionless verb ''to be'' is used in the place of the more usual modal verbs which would normally connect the speaker to the statement. In this way, statements are given weight (as if some external force, rather than the speaker, is governing events).

Conversely, however, the construction also provides an uncertainty aspect, since it frees the speaker from responsibility on their statement – in the phrase "John will go", for example, the speaker is almost advocating their certainty that John will, in fact, go; meanwhile, "the Prime Minister is to go" simply states the '''''knowledge''''' that the PM's going is in some way foreseen. (If John ends up not going, for example, the "will go" construction is negated, while the PM's "to go" construction would still hold true, since all it expresses is an ''expectation''). In both cases, the knowledge is simply being reported (or pretends to be) from an independent source. In this sense, this impersonal ''to + verb'' construction can almost be seen as a fledgeling renarrative mood.

== Germanic languages ==

'''不定詞'''（ふていし）とは、ヨーロッパ言語の単数、複数などに「限定」されないことから不定詞という。明治、大正期までは、ラテン文法の影響を受け、法の一種とみなして'''不定法'''と呼ばれることもあったが現在ではほとんど法とはみなしていない。[対語；定形動詞、定動詞]

ポルトガル語には、不定詞でありながら人称と数によって変化する'''人称不定詞'''がある。

==英語==
動詞の原形の前に前置詞 "to" を付けて使用する'''to不定詞'''と，動詞の原形のみで使用する'''原形不定詞'''(bare infinitive, root infinitive)がある。to不定詞の用法は以下の3つが挙げられる。一般に不定詞は未来指向であるとされ、過去指向とされる動名詞と異なる。（それが顕著になる例：動詞 forget, rememberなどとの併用）

===形容詞的用法===
*おもに名詞を後ろから修飾する。
** I want something ''to eat''.（何か食物が欲しい）

===副詞的用法===
*おもに動詞、形容詞、副詞、文全体を修飾する。副詞節の代用のような役割を果たす。
** I'm glad '''to play''' baseball. （野球をして嬉しい；感情的な原因）
** '''To score''' high, you must study hard. （高得点を取る為には、一生懸命勉強しなければならない；目的）
::=''In order that'' you ''may'' get a high score, ～
::=You must study hard ''with a view to'' [''for the purpose of''] get''ting'' high a score. 
**He went to the war, '''never to return'''.（彼は戦争に行き、帰ってこなかった。；結果）
**I worked hard, '''only to fail''' again.（私は一生懸命働いたが、また失敗しただけだった。；結果）
**she must be clever '''to think of''' that.（そんなことを考えるとは彼女は賢いに違いない。；根拠）
*独立不定詞；慣用句として用いられる。
**to tell the truth「正直に言えば」
**to be sure「確かに」
::''c.f.'' to be sure～, but....「確かに～だが...」
**to be frank with you (=frankly speaking)「率直に言えば」
**to speak generally (=generally speaking)「一般的に言えば」
**not to mention～「～は言うまでもなく」(=it is needless to say that～, it goes without saying that～) 
**needless to say「言うまでもないことだが」 
**to make matters worse「さらに悪いことには」

===名詞的用法===
*おもに主語、目的語、補語の役割を果たす。動名詞との使い分けが生ずる。
**''To play'' (=Playing) baseball is fun.（野球することは楽しい）
**I want ''to be'' a scholar.（私は学者になりたい）
**My plan is ''to stay'' in New York.（ニューヨークに滞在する予定だ）

*形式主語、形式目的語のitを伴って後置される。
**''It'' is important ''to discuss'' the problem.（その問題を議論するのは重要だ）
**I thought ''it'' fine ''to answer'' in a clear voice.（明瞭な声で答えたのは素晴らしいと思った）

*疑問詞+to不定詞で名詞句をつくる。
**I didn't know ''what to say''.（何を言うべきか分からなかった）
**Tell me ''where to go''.（どこへ行けばいいのか教えてくれ）

===原形不定詞の用法===
*第 5 文型で使役動詞 (make, have, let)、知覚動詞 (see, hear など) の目的格補語に用いられる。（この場合、目的語が原形不定詞の意味上の主語になる。）

**I ''saw'' the cat '''cross''' the road.（私は、その猫がその道路を横切っているのを見た。）

*助動詞及び助動詞的な慣用句の後に用いられる。（助動詞が人称を表す。時制は原形不定詞を完了形にする。）
**He ''cannot (choose) but'' '''laugh'''. = He ''cannot help'' '''laugh'''.（彼は、笑うしかなかった。）※choose を挿入するのは古風な表現。cannot help but（+原形不定詞）は誤用である。

*仮定法現在で、願望、期待、要求、提案、命令、主張などを表す動詞に続く目的語の名詞節ないし、批評を表す形容詞の主語である名詞節の本文中に用いられる。（原形不定詞の前に助動詞 should が省略されていると考えられる。）
