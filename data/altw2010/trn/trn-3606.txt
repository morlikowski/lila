==Release history==
The album was originally released in April 1987 on vinyl and cassette. The album cover for this release is a centered ink splatter, with text to the extremes of the cover. The tape has a larger smear of the ink, that looks more like a green spot.
The second release of this album was on November 15, 1996. It was released by Slash/Uni Records. This version also featured the centered ink splatter.
The last release of this album was many years later, on October 17, 2000, through Slash/Rhino Records; they later released ''This Is It: The Best of Faith No More'' in 2003. This version has a close up of the ink splatter with the wording a bit further from the edges.
