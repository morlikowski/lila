'''Nottingham Forest Football Club''' is an English professional football club based at the European Cups, along with the domestic title, two League Cups. 

Nottingham Forest take their name from the Forest Recreation Ground just north of the city centre which is where the team first played and is now the site of the annual Nottingham Goose Fair. The club is often referred to simply as ''Forest'' (not to be confused with the entirely unrelated older amateur side, Forest F.C., which is better known as The Wanderers F.C.), the name the club carries on its badge. 

Forest fans typically dislike the club being referred to as Notts Forest. This is because ''Notts'' is the correct abbreviation of Nottinghamshire (hence Notts County), but not of Nottingham itself. The appropriate abbreviation of Nottingham Forest is ''Nott'm Forest''

Relegation to English football's third tier in 2004-05 made Forest the first European Cup-winning club ever to fall into its country's third division; however, Forest returned to The Championship after winning promotion at the end of the 2007-08 season.

Many of today's footballing rules and features, including floodlighting, shinpads, and even lettering on the stands have been pioneered by Forest. See below.

==History==

<!--This section is meant to be just a summary. Please do not add too much detail - the "History of Nottingham Forest" article is intended for detailed additions.-->
thumb|right|150px|The club's crest during the 1960s
Forest were founded in 1865 by a group of Notts County, (thought to be the world's oldest surviving professional football club), in 1862. The club's committee decided that Forest's colours should be ''Garibaldi Red'', named after the Italian patriot who headed the redshirts party. They joined the Football Alliance in 1888, and won the competition in 1892.  They were then allowed entry to the Football League. They also provided Arsenal with their first ever kit.

Forest claimed their first major honour when they won the 1898 Derby County 3-1 at Crystal Palace. However, for much of the first half of the 20th century the club spent life in the Second Division (and had to seek re-election in 1914 after finishing bottom). In 1949 the club were relegated to the Third Division, but bounced back two years later as champions of the Second. A brief period of glory followed at the end of the 1950s, as they regained First Division status in 1957 and won the FA Cup for a second time in 1959, despite losing Wembley 'hoodoo'. By this time Forest had become the biggest team in Nottingham, overtaking Notts County. But after reaching the high of runners-up spot and cup semi-finalists in 1967, Forest were relegated from the First Division in 1972.

Forest were considered a small club by English league standards until the mid 1970s, when Peter Taylor took the helm at the club. Clough was the most successful manager in the history of Nottingham Forest football club.  He had won the league title with Forest's neighbours Derby County in 1972, and came to Nottingham Forest on January 6 1975, after a 0-2 home defeat by Notts County, on Boxing day, prompted the committee (Forest had no board of directors then) to sack the previous manager Allan Brown. Clough's first game in charge was the third round F.A. Cup replay against Tottenham Hotspur, a 1-0 victory thanks to a goal by Scottish Centre Forward Neil Martin (at Forest Martin had already become the first player to score 100 league goals in both Scotland and England).<ref>[http://www.football-england.com/neil_martin.html Neil Martin] Football England</ref>

Forest won promotion to the top division at the end of the 1976-77 season after finishing third in the Second Division, but no-one could have predicted how successful Clough's team would be over the next three seasons. 

Nottingham Forest became one of the few teams (and the most recent team to date) to win the English First Division Championship a year after winning promotion from the English Second Division (1978-79, Forest went on to win the European Cup by beating 1979-80, beating League Cups. Beside Shilton, key players of that era included right-back England jersey), midfielder John Robertson, midfielder 1983-84 but were knocked out by Anderlecht in dishonest circumstances in which a Forest goal was controversially disallowed. It later emerged that in the second leg, the Belgian club had bribed the referee.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/42383.stm BBC News | Football | Forest sues Anderlecht over '84 bribery scandal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Nottingham Forest's next significant trophy came in 1989 when they beat Luton Town in the League Cup final.  For most of the season they had been hopeful of completing a unique domestic treble, but were beaten into third place in the League by Arsenal and Liverpool and lost to Liverpool in the replay of the Hillsborough, where 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death on terracing, the match was abandoned after 6 minutes. Clough's side retained the League Cup in 1990 when they beat Oldham Athletic.  There was chance for more success in 1991 when Forest reached their only FA Cup final under Brian Clough and went ahead after scoring an early goal (Stuart Pearce free kick) against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley, but ended up losing 2-1 in extra time after an own goal by Des Walker. 

Forest reached their third League Cup final in four seasons in 1992, but lost to Manchester United, and in this successful period also won the Full Members Cup twice (1989 and 1992).

Brian Clough's 18-year reign as manager ended in May 1993 when Forest were relegated from the Premier League after 16 illustrious years of top flight football which had seen a league title, two European Cups and four League Cups.

Leyton Orient in 1989. Having inherited most of the players from the Clough era, Clark was able to achieve an instant return to the Premiership when the club finished Division One runners-up at the end of the 1993-94 season. Forest's return to the Premiership was impressive as they finished third in 1994-95 and qualified for the 1996-97 season became a relegation battle and Clark was sacked in December. 34-year-old captain Stuart Pearce was installed as player-manager on a temporary basis and he inspired a brief upturn in the club's fortunes. He was tipped to become manager on a permanent basis, but the Forest directors wanted someone more experienced so in March 1997 they turned to Crystal Palace manager Dave Bassett. Forest were unable to avoid relegation and finished the season in bottom place. They won promotion back to the Premiership at the first attempt, being crowned Division One champions in 1997-98.

Bassett was sacked in January 1999, with Manchester United. 

David Platt spent approximately £12m on players, including the Italian veterans England U-21s when Forest were in financial difficulties.

Premiership was blown away by Sheffield United in the semi-finals. Forest then collapsed next season and Hart was sacked in February 2004 as The Reds hovered near the foot of Division One.

Joe Kinnear, the next manager of Forest, was unable to bring out the best of his inherited side to move up to 14th place in the final league table. The next season was poor for Forest as they fell into the relegation zone with Kinnear resigning in December 2004. Following a brief stint from Mick Harford, Gary Megson took charge of Forest in January 2005 but could not prevent them finishing second-bottom of the league, and slipping down into the third tier (League One) for the first time in 54 years.

A 3-0 defeat at Oldham Athletic in February 2006 proved to be the last straw for Megson, who departed by "mutual consent" with the Reds just four points above the relegation zone.  However, Swindon Town.  Forest took 28 points from a possible 39 under the two, but it was too late for them as they finished in 7th place.

Yeovil Town. After beating them 2-0 in the first-leg, Forest succumbed to a 5-2 (Agg: 5-4) extra time defeat, despite being 3-1 up on aggregate with 83 minutes gone.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/6649773.stm</ref>

In the 2007-08 campaign, Forest were named title favourites for the third consecutive year. After failing to win in their first six competitive games, Forest then hit an eight-game unbeaten run in the league (including five wins), scoring seventeen goals in the process. After losing to Luton, Forest went on another unbeaten run, this time of six games in all competitions. This briefly took Forest to the top of the league table over Christmas, the first time they had been top all season. However, they lost top spot with some poor results, as they failed to win away from home, in a run lasting seven games.  After moving back into second place, Forest's away form once again was found lacking which allowed Carlisle and Doncaster to overtake them into second and third place respectively.  Forest hit a poor spell of results, seeing them collect just one win in seven games.  However, they turned their form around, and after being 11 points behind second-place at one point, Forest amazingly turned it around.  A win at Carlisle saw Forest then win six out of their last seven games of the season.  Forest, who had rarely been in the automatic promotion places throughout the season got promoted to the Championship on a dramatic last day of the season, by beating Yeovil 3-2 at the City Ground to secure second place. The Reds kept a league record of 24 clean sheets out of 46 games, which helped them end their three-year spell in the league's third tier and gain their first promotion in ten years.

Since the end of the season, Forest has made a handful of promising signings, including: Wales international striker Liverpool midfielder Paul Anderson on a one year loan, ex-Manchester United striker Carlisle United for £1.14m. Players departing Forest include striker Shrewsbury Town, Northern Ireland international midfielder Norwich City, Ghanian international striker Zamalek Sporting Club, left back Matt Lockwood to Colchester United and midfielder Derby County.
