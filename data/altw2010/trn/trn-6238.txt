'''アルトゥール・ルービンシュタイン'''（</small> Arthur Rubinstein, 1887年1月28日 - 1982年12月20日）は、ポーランド出身のピアニスト。

== 略歴 ==
前半生はショパンの専門家として有名だが、ブラームスやスペインのピアノ音楽も得意とした。20世紀の代表的なピアニストの1人である。

モーツァルトのピアノ協奏曲第23番を演奏しデビュー。サン＝サーンスやラヴェルらや、ヴァイオリニストのジャック・ティボーと面会する。アントン・ルービンシュタイン国際ピアノコンクールで優勝するが、ユダヤ人だったために審査員や聴衆から人種差別を受けたと後に語っている。

1906年にニューヨークのカーネギー・ホールで行なったリサイタルは聴衆に支持されたようだが、評論家から批判が相次いだため4年間、演奏活動を中止して自らの技巧・表現に磨きをかけた。その後アメリカ合衆国やオーストリア、イタリア、ロシア、スペインで演奏旅行を行なった。特にスペインでは聴衆の圧倒的支持を受け、多数の追加公演を行った。1912年にはロンドンデビューを果たす。

南米を旅行し、同時代のスペインの作曲家に熱狂して多くの新作を初演する。1932年にしばらく演奏生活から隠退して、数年のあいだ演奏技巧やレパートリーの改善に取り組んだ。この年に指揮者エミル・ムリナルスキの娘アニエラと結婚し、4人の子供をもうけた。娘エヴァは神学者・聖職者・反戦運動家のウィリアム・スローン・コフィン師と結婚し、息子ジョンは俳優となった。第二次世界大戦中はアメリカ合衆国に暮らし、1946年に米国籍を取得。

1960年ジュネーブで死去。

== ルービンシュタインと室内楽 ==
特にソリストとして有名ではあるものの、卓越した室内楽演奏家でもあり、シェリングや、フルニエ、モーツァルトやベートーヴェン、シューベルト、シューマン、ブラームス、ドヴォルザークの作品を録音した。ハイフェッツ及びピアティゴルスキー）とのピアノ・トリオは有名で、ラヴィニアの音楽祭で共演した際に、宣伝担当者が「百万ドルトリオ」と名づけた（ただし、ルービンシュタインはこの呼び名をひどく嫌っていた）。しかし、ハイフェッツとは作品の解釈や、どちらの名が先にレコードのジャケットに表記されるべきかをめぐって常に揉め、芸術的にも人間的にも対立点が多く、1950年を境に2度と共演はおこなわなかった。

「百万ドル・トリオ」の華麗な演奏マナーを反省し、シェリングやフルニエと組んで録音したブラームスのピアノ三重奏曲全集は1975年に、同じ顔ぶれによるシューベルトのピアノ三重奏曲集は1976年に、それぞれグラミー賞を授与されている。そのほかにも2度グラミー賞に輝いている。

'''Arthur [Artur] Rubinstein''' KBE (Polish-American pianist who is widely considered as one of the greatest virtuosi of the  20th century. He received international acclaim for his performances of Spanish music. 

==Biography==
'''Arthur Rubinstein''' was born on January 28, 1887, the youngest child of a businessman from the large Jewish community of Łódź, Congress Poland, today's Poland. He was not related to the earlier Russian pianist-composer Anton Rubinstein, nor his Polish near contemporary, the cosmetics giant Helena Rubinstein.

Aside from his early and singular fascination with the piano, another interesting childhood trait is that Rubinstein didn't begin speaking until some time around the age of three. Until the time that he developed speech, Rubinstein would entertain his family by imitating non-speech sounds.<ref name=sachs></ref> The descriptions of Rubinstein's delayed speech, his early childhood tantrums and his later virtuosity closely follow a similar pattern of development of other famous late-talkers, such as fellow pianist Clara Schumann and physicist (and sometimes-musician) Albert Einstein, among others.<ref></ref>
 
Beginning at the piano when he was still two years of age, Rubinstein first studied in Piano Concerto No. 2'' in the presence of the composer. Through the family of Juliusz Wertheim (to whose understanding of Chopin's genius he attributed his own inspiration in the works of that composer) he formed a friendship with the violinist Paweł Kochański, which led later to artistic and social involvement with Karol Szymanowski.<ref>Sachs 1997,</ref>

Rubinstein made his New York debut at Carnegie Hall in 1906, and thereafter toured the United States, Austria, Italy, and Russia. According to his own testimony and that of his son in François Reichenbach's film ''L'Amour de la vie'' (1969), however, he was not well received in the United States, and in 1907, when he found himself destitute and desperate in a Berlin hotel room, hounded by creditors and threatened with being thrown out into the street, he tried to hang himself, but failed, and then felt "reborn" with a great love of life. In 1912, he made his London debut, and was frequently in London until 1914 in the musical salon of Paul and Muriel Draper, in company with Kochanski, Stravinsky, Jacques Thibaud, Pablo Casals, Pierre Monteux and others.<ref>Sachs, ibid.</ref> 

During World War I Rubinstein lived mainly in London, accompanying the violinist Eugène Ysaÿe. From 1916 to 1917, he toured Spain and South America, developing an enthusiasm for the music of Enrique Granados, Isaac Albéniz, Manuel de Falla, and Heitor Villa-Lobos. He was the dedicatee of Villa-Lobos's ''Rudepoêma'' and Stravinsky's Trois mouvements de Petrouchka. 

After 1914 Rubinstein never again played in Germany.
 
In 1917, Rubinstein left Cádiz, Spain with his music manager Ernesto de Quesada, on the Infanta Isabel to South America. He debuted on July 2, 1917 in the Teatro Odéon, in Buenos Aires. This tour included concerts in Buenos Aires, Montevideo,Uruguay, Santiago de Chile and Valparaíso, Chile.

In 1921 he made two American tours, travelling to New York with Paweł Kochański (who remained his lifelong friend) and Karol Szymanowski. The autumn voyage was the occasion of Kochański's permanent migration to the USA.<ref>Sachs 1997, 200-212.</ref> 

Rubinstein made numerous live-recording player piano music rolls for the Aeolian Duo-Art system and the American Piano Company (AMPICO), all of which survive today and can be heard. In 1932, he withdrew from concert life for several months to work on his technique and repertoire. Astor Piazzolla cites a Rubinstein concert staged in Buenos Aires in 1939 as one of his first great impressions, which led the 18-year-old to write and dedicate to Rubinstein a piano "concerto", a definition that Rubinstein was to debate with the young composer.

During World War II, the Germans looted his home in Paris, and his career became centered in the United States. Impresario Sol Hurok insisted Rubinstein be billed as ''Artur'' for his American concerts, even though the pianist referred to himself as ''Arthur'' when in English speaking countries. He became a naturalized citizen in 1946. He refused to play in post-war Germany because of the Nazi extermination of most of his family. While never becoming an observant Jew, he was a passionate supporter of Israel. He retired from the stage in 1976, as his eyesight and hearing were rapidly deteriorating.  He became almost blind in later life.  

Although best known as a recitalist and concerto soloist, Rubinstein was also considered an outstanding chamber musician, partnering with such luminaries as Romantic composers.  He recorded nearly all the works of Chopin.  He was one of the earliest champions of the  Spanish and South American composers and of French composers who, in the early 20th century, were still considered "modern" such as Debussy and Dukas.  In addition, Rubinstein was the first champion of the music of his compatriot Karol Szymanowski.  Rubinstein, in conversation with Alexander Scriabin, named Brahms as his favorite composer, a response that enraged Scriabin.<ref>Artur Rubinstein, ''My Young Years'', quoted in Norman Lebrecht, ''The Book of Musical Anecdotes''</ref>

Rubinstein was fluent in eight languages.<ref name=sachs/> His photographic memory of much of the repertoire, not simply that of the piano, was formidable.<ref name=sachs/>  According to his memoirs, the pianist learned César Franck’s ''Symphonic Variations'' while on a train en route to the concert, without the benefit of a piano.

===Marriage and death===
Rubinstein was married in 1932 to Aniela (Nela) Mlynarska, daughter of conductor Mary Irene Curzon and, in 1977 at age 90, left his wife for the young Annabelle Whitestone, though he and Nela never divorced.

Rubinstein was proud of being a Jew and was a great friend of Israel, which he visited several times with his wife and children, giving concerts with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, recitals, and master classes at the Jerusalem Music Center. In his will, he asked to be buried in Jerusalem. Rubinstein died in Geneva, Switzerland, on December 20,  1982, at the age of 95, and his body was cremated. On the first anniversary of his death, an urn holding his ashes was buried in Jerusalem, Israel, in a dedicated plot now dubbed "Rubinstein Forest" overlooking the Jerusalem Forest. This was arranged with the rabbis so that the main forest wouldn't fall under religious laws governing cemeteries. Israel now has an Arthur Rubinstein International Music Society which holds the triennial Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Master Competition <ref></ref>
