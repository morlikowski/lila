'''Arcadia''' or '''Arkadía''' (Greek Αρκαδία) is a region of Greece in the Peloponnesus. It takes its name from the mythological character Arcas.

==Modern Arcadia==
Arcadia has its present-day capital at Tripoli.  It forms the largest prefecture on the Peloponnesian peninsula.  It currently covers about 18% of the entire peninsula, although it once extended to about 20 to 25% of the peninsula.

The prefecture has a skiing resort on Mount Maenalus, the Mainalon, located about 20 km NW of Tripoli.  The other mountains include the Parnon in the southeast, the Artemisio, the Saita, the Skiathio, the Lykaia and Tsiberou.

The Megalopolis, along with a coal mine.

Arcadia has two tunnels. The Artemisio Tunnel opened first, followed by the tunnel east of Megalopolis; both serve traffic flowing between Messenia and Athens.

In agriculture, potato farms (dominant in central and northcentral Arcadia), mixed farming, olive groves, and pasture dominate the plains of Arcadia, especially in the area around Megalopolis and between Tripoli and Levidi.  One of these cuisines were featured on Mega Channel's cooking show hosted by Mamalakis that was shown on prime time.

Theodoros Kolokotronis (1770 - 1843), a general in the Greek War of Independence (1821 - 1832), lived in Arcadia.

Dimitris Plapoutas (1786-1864), a general in the Greek War of Independence, also lived in Arcadia.  

==Ancient and modern towns and cities==

==Climate==
The climate consists of hot summers and mild winters in the eastern part, the southern part, the low lying areas and the central area at altitudes lower than 1,000 m.  The area primarily receives rain during fall and winter months in the rest of Arcadia.  Winter snow occurs commonly in the mountainous areas for much of the west and the northern part, the Taygetus area, the Mainalon.

==History==
thumb|300px|''[[Les Bergers d’Arcadie'' by Nicolas Poussin.]]

Due to its remote, mountainous character, Arcadia has always been a classical refuge. So during the Mycenaean Greek was replaced with Tsakonian Greek , still spoken  on the coast of the modern prefecture of Arcadia,  in the Classical period   considered the southern Argolid coast immediately adjoining Arcadia, is a descendant of Doric Greek, and as such is an extraordinary   example of a surviving regional  dialect of archaic Greek. The capital of Tsakonia is the Arcadian coastal town of Leonidio.

One of the birthplaces reported for Lycaon, a cannibalistic Callisto. It was also said to have been the birthplace of Zeus' son, Hermes.

Arcadia remained a rustic, secluded area, and its inhabitants became proverbial as primitive herdsmen leading  simple pastoral 
unsophisticated yet happy lives, to the point that ''Arcadia'' may refer to some imaginary idyllic paradise, immortalized by Virgil's Eclogues, and later by Jacopo Sannazaro in his pastoral masterpiece, ''Arcadia'' (1504); see also Arcadia (utopia).

Arcadia later joined the Ottoman Turks with some exceptions in the 16th century for a couple of years.  During these periods, many towns and villages were founded.

The Latin phrase ''Et in Arcadia ego'' which is usually interpreted to mean "I am also in Arcadia" or "I am even in Arcadia" is an example of ''memento mori'', a cautionary reminder of the transitory nature of life and the inevitability of death. The phrase is most often associated with a 1647 painting by Nicolas Poussin, also known as "The Arcadian Shepherds". In the painting the phrase appears as an inscription on a tomb discovered by youthful figures in classical garb. It has been suggested that the phrase is an anagram for the Latin phrase "I! Tego arcana Dei", which translates to "Begone! I keep God's secrets."

After 400 years of occupation by the Ottomans, Arcadia was the centre of the Tripoli which saw the Greek revolutionaries slaughter around 30,000 Turks. After a victorious revolutionary war, Arcadia was finally incorporated into a newly-created Greek state.  Arcadia saw economic growth and small emigration.

In the 20th century, Arcadia experienced extensive population loss through emigration, mostly to the Americas.  Many Arcadian villages lost almost half their inhabitants, and fears arose that they would turn into ghost towns.  Arcadia now has a smaller population than Corinthia.  Demographers expected that its population would halve between 1951 and the early 21st century.  The prefectural population is in a range to a point that could fall below the 100,000 mark which could make it the next prefecture in Greece to have fewer than 100,000 people.

After World War II and the Greek Civil War, many villages and towns were rebuilt.

An enormous earthquake with a 5 Richter scale range shook Megalopoli and the surrounding area.  Many buildings were destroyed, leaving people homeless. Within a couple of years, the buildings were rebuilt anti-seismically.  In 1967, construction began on the Megalopoli Power Plant.  It began operating in 1970, producing electricity for southern Greece.  A mining area south of the plant is the largest mining area in the peninsula and continues to the present day with one settlement moved.

Water problems troubled local residents protesting over the rights of water usage with the Argolida and its new reservoir near Saga, on Agios Petros on February 10, 2008.
