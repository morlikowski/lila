"'''The President Wore Pearls'''" is the third episode of the ''The Simpsons''' fifteenth season, first broadcast on November 16, 2003. The episode was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Music (by Alf Clausen) And Lyrics (by Dana Gould).

==Plot==
Springfield Elementary holds a Homer wins big, but when Martin points out that his winnings can only be redeemed for Principal Skinner tells Martin he must resign as president. An election for a new president is announced, and Lisa signs up. However, initially popular Nelson Muntz is favored to win. During a debate in the school auditorium, she sings a song about how she will fight for student rights, winning them over.

Lisa easily wins the election. Worried by her determination and popularity, the faculty discusses how to control her. Following Mrs. Krabappel's suggestion that a woman's weakness is vanity, the school faculty tells Lisa that as President, she deserves a more glamorous look. Another song is sung (a spoof of "Rainbow High") as the teachers give Lisa a makeover into a fashionable strike. 

The students leave school in protest and Michael Moore (voicing himself) shows up to take their side. The police arrive at the school to handle the students with child-size batons, but Lisa soon convinces the police to take their side too. Several other labor unions, including goat milkers, newsroom cue card holders and theme park zombies join the strike. Even Groundskeeper Willie refuses Skinner's order to turn his hose on the students. Realizing there is no other way out of the crippling strike other than disposing of Lisa, Skinner has her transferred to a school for the "Academically Gifted and Troublesome". She waves goodbye to her classmates singing another parody song ("Don't Cry For Me, Argentina").

Just as Lisa arrives at her new school, Homer pulls up and refuses to allow her to attend, complaining that he won't drive 45 minutes each day to take her to school. He suggests she take up an activity like ice skating instead, but when she eagerly asks to do that, he refuses once again, complaining that he doesn't want get up early each morning. 

At the end of the episode, subtitles state that Springfield Elementary was eventually able to restore music, art and gym by cancelling a musical based on the life of Eva Perón".

*The name could be a parody of The Devil Wears Prada or The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes.
*Martin claims he got the idea for the casino fundraiser from an episode of sitcom ''Saved By The Bell'', but no such episode exists.
*Martin's resignation as student body president mirrors that of Richard Nixon.
*The episode is a parody of the musical ''Evita''. It is a musical episode with five songs, most of them parodies of numbers from ''Evita''. Also, the poster Lisa uses in her election campaign is the cover of the original Broadway recording, with Lisa's face instead of Eva Perón's.
*The episode also pays homage to the student-initiated strike of May 1968 in France. 
* Lenny says "But I break just like a little girl," a reference to the Just Like a Woman".
* After Lisa walks off carried by the crowd in the auditorium, Nelson sings "I am Iron Man! Do do do do do do do vote for me!", a reference to the Iron Man"
* The Magnet School for gifted and troublesome kids is a parody of the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men
*Lisa lists her email address as "smartgirl63_\@yahoo.com" (which is deliberately invalid since Yahoo does not allow "\" as a character in their email addresses).
*The way in which the teacher staff and principal Skinner diverts Lisa from her program by introducing a lot of "public appeariences" and also the way they trick her to sign that document mirrors the ways of government secretaries in the british sitcom Yes minister
