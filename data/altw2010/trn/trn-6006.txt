'''Venom''' on Marvel-kustantamon luoma superroisto, toiselta planeetalta kotoisin oleva symbiootti. Vaikka Venom esiintyi symbioottina jo Salattujen Sotien -tarinajatkumon aikaan, varsinaisen hahmon loivat Hämähäkkimiehen vastustaja. Hahmon ensiesiintyminen symbioottina tapahtui ''Amazing Spider-Man'' -lehden numerossa 252 ja ''Amazing Spider-Man'' -lehden numerossa 298 varsinaisena Venomina. 

== Historia ==
thumb|left|Hämähäkkimies on ihmeissään uudesta "puvustaan" Hämähäkkimiehen animaatiosarjassa.
Hämähäkkimies sai Salattuina Sotina tunnetussa ''crossover''-tarinassa uuden muukalaisteknologiaa hyödyntävän puvun. Tämä puku reagoi käyttäjän ajatuksiin, pystyi matkimaan siviilivaatteita ja muodosti loppumattomasti seittiä. 

Maahan palattuaan Hämähäkkimiehelle selvisi, että puku olikin tietoinen, elävä Herra Fantastisen avulla Hämähäkkimies onnistui irrottautumaan puvusta.

Myöhemmin puku yritti sulautua vielä viimeisen kerran Hämähäkkimiehen kanssa, mutta tämä yritys epäonnistui. Heikentyneenä puku liukui pois ja katosi, ilmeisesti kuolettavasti vahingoittuneena.

Samoihin aikoihin reportteri '''Eddie Brock''' oli kirjoittanut lukuisia artikkeleita Synninpäästäjänä tunnetusta mielipuolisesta murhaajasta. Hän seurasi väärää johtolankaa ja nimesi siten väärän henkilön murhaajaksi. Erehdys paljastui pian, kun Hämähäkkimies paljasti oikean syyllisen. 

Brock sai potkut ja hän päätti tappaa itsensä. Uskonnollisena katolisena hän meni pyytämään Jumalalta anteeksiantoa ennen tekoaan. Tällöin puku löysi Brockin ja sulautui epäonnistuneeseen toimittajaan. Yhdistyminen järkytti kumpaakin pahoin satutettua yksilöä. Uusi symbioottinen pari otti nimeksen Venom ja päätti kostaa Hämähäkkimiehelle.

== Voimat ja varusteet ==

Venomilla on muuten samat voimat kuin Hämähäkkimiehellä, mutta hän on vahvempi kuin Hämähäkkimies (uudelleensyntymänsä jälkeen Hämähäkkimiehen voimataso tosin on noussut, joten nykyinen Venom ei nykyään olisi häntä voimakkaampi. Katso artikkeli Hämähäkkimies).:
* Gargan nostaa n.11 tonnia. Ihanneoloissa jopa 13 tonnia. Alkuperäinen Venom eli Eddie Brock nosti peräti 20 tonnia.
* osaa kiivetä seinillä
* osaa luoda omaa seittiään (Venomin seitti on vahvempaa kuin Hämähäkkimiehen, mutta heikkenee jouduttuaan eroon symbiootista)
* Hämähäkkivaisto (Venomin Hämähäkkivaisto ei ole yhtä tarkka kuin Hämähäkkimiehellä, joten hän ei pysty esim. väistämään luotia (Eikä hänen tarvitsekaan, koska puku suojaa luodeilta), kuten Hämähäkkimies. Venom voidaan myös yllättää, toisin kuin Hämähäkkimies)
sekä pari uutta:
* kaikki mihin musta-valkoinen puku pystyi (muuttaa muotoaan ym.)
* osaa muuttua näkymättömäksi

Hämähäkkimiehen vaistoakin voi hämätä, mutta vain jos on sulautuneena symbioottipukuun kuten esim. Venom tai Carnage. Tällöin Hämähäkkimiehen hämähäkkivaisto ei kykene tunnistamaan heitä, ennen kuin he ovat suoraan tämän edessä.

'''Venom''', or the '''Venom Symbiote''', is the name given to the first symbiote life form to appear in the fictional Marvel Universe. The creature is a sentient alien with a gooey, almost liquid-like form. It requires a host, usually human, to bond around for its survival. In return the Venom creature gives its host enhanced powers. In effect, when the Venom Symbiote bonds with a human to form a super-villain, that new dual-life form itself is also often called Venom. The symbiote, with or without a host, is an archenemy of Spider-Man, who was the first host it merged with before its evil motives were clear. After Spider-Man rejected it,  the symbiote went on to merge with other hosts and so began its popular reign as the villain known as Venom.

The Venom Symbiote first appeared in ''Eddie Brock, its most well-known host, in ''Scorpion. 

Originally, the symbiote was portrayed as a mute and lonely creature craving the company of a host.  More recently, it has been shown as increasingly abusive of its hosts, and having the powers of speech.  Also the Venom Symbiote itself has no known name, as ''Venom'' is essentially the Magneto, Doctor Doom, and Red Skull.<ref>Mark Millar (w),  Terry Dodson (p),  Rachel Dodson (i). ""Venomous"" Marvel Knights: Spider-Man,  #7 December 2004  Marvel Comics</ref>

The Venom symbiote also appears in the film ''Spider-Man 3'', first merging to Spider-Man's suit and then to Eddie Brock Jr.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Venom===

The creature that would ultimately become Venom was born to a race of extraterrestrial parasites, which lived by possessing the bodies of other lifeforms. The parasites would endow their victims with enhanced physical abilities, at the cost of fatally draining them of adrenaline. 

According to the ''Planet Of The Symbiotes'' storyline, the Venom symbiote was deemed insane by its own race after it was discovered that it desired to commit to its host rather than use it up. The symbiote was then imprisoned on Battleworld to ensure it didn't pollute the species' gene pool.

===Main hosts===
====Spider-Man====

In ''Spider-Woman, forms a new costume. To Spider-Man's surprise, the costume can mimic street clothes and provides a seemingly inexhaustible and stronger supply of webbing.<ref></ref> 

Once back on sentient alien symbiote that wishes to fuse permanently with him and often controls his body while he sleeps. With the aid of Vulturions attacks and Spider-Man forces himself into a church belltower. As the bells ring to sound the hour, Spider-Man fights through willpower to reject the symbiote, leaving both the alien and Spider-Man weakened. The symbiote, using its remaining strength, carries an unconscious Spider-Man to safety from the bells before it slithers away.<ref></ref> Spider-Man's rejection of the symbiote would later leave it extremely bitter toward Spider-Man, a trait it would share with its future hosts.

====Eddie Brock====
thumb|150px|Eddie Brock as the first Venom

The first Venom, Eddie Brock was a reporter for the Daily Globe before he fabricated a story revealing the identity of the Sin-Eater. Shortly after the story was published Spider-Man caught the real Sin-Eater, and Brock was disgraced as a news reporter, costing him his job and then his wife. Now writing for cheap gossip magazines Brock centers the frustration of his life on utter loathing of Spider-Man, which only escalates when it is revealed he has cancer. In response Brock begins working out and bringing his body to a higher performance<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Venom Brock, Eddie - Marvel Universe: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Meanwhile, the Symbiote needing another human host in order to survive finds itself psychically attracted to Brock for both his increased adrenaline and mutual hatred for Spider-Man.

Together they formed into the first of the dark, villainous creatures known as '''Venom'''. This name originally applied to Brock, over the Symbiote. But over the years as the Symbiote itself lent toward more intelligence and moved to additional human hosts the name began to apply to the Symbiote as well as its hosts. Brock as Venom fought Spider-Man many times, and came close to winning on several occasions. As well as helping Eddie to seek continued revenge against Spider-Man, the symbiote also allowed him to indulge in a sporadic career as a vigilante. Eddie and the symbiote both share, at times, a desire to protect innocent people from all harm, even if it means working side-by-side with the hated Spider-Man.

====Mac Gargan====
thumb|150px|Mac Gargan as the third and current Venom.

The Venom symbiote approached '''Macdonald "Mac" Gargan''', formerly known as Scorpion, <ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #9</ref> and offered him new abilities. Gargan bonded with the creature, which would later give him an extra edge as part of Avengers dealt with the rest of the Twelve<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #11</ref>. Gargan later became a member of a sub-group of the Thunderbolts<ref>''Civil War'' #4</ref>, which was drafted<ref>''Civil War: Choosing Sides'' #1</ref> by the Avengers to hunt down the members of the fugitive Secret Avengers. It was then revealed that he had been outfitted with electrical implants by the government to keep the symbiote in check<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #2</ref> When in the Venom persona Gargan retained very little of his original personality and was controlled almost completely by the symbiote, and when the symbiote was dormant in his body he expressed nausea and fear of the organism. <ref>''Thunderbolts'' #112</ref>

===Other hosts===
thumb||right|120px|Anne Weying, the bride of Venom.
====Ann Weying==== 
Ann Weying first appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #375. She was Eddie Brock's ex-wife, a successful Sin-Eater shoots Ann as part of a crusade against social injustice. Ann becomes She-Venom when the Venom Symbiote temporarily bonds with her to save her life.

She-Venom then lashes out against the men who had hurt her with such violence that Eddie became afraid for her (and of her) and compells the symbiote back to him. Ann retched upon seeing the pile of bodies she had left behind. She screamed, "That thing made me do that!" Eddie replied, "It can't make you do anything you don't really want to do." Later the police incarcerates Ann on a false charge (unrelated to Ann's rampage above) in order to trap Venom. Ann uses her one phone call to warn Eddie and make him promise not to come. He promises that Eddie Brock wouldn't come to save her and instead sent his Other (the symbiote) through the phonelines to her. After it bonds with her she is able to escape custody. 

Sometime later, Ann spots Spider-Man webslinging in an older black costume at a time when his regular red and blue suit had been stolen.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #19</ref> Ann, still reeling from the experience of bonding with the symbiote months earlier and unable to deal with the return of Eddie Brock into her life -- coupled with Brock's transformation into Venom directly in front of her as he ran off to kill Spider-Man -- sent her over the edge, and she leaps from her high rise apartment to her death. Her death is later confirmed when her tombstone is shown.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #22</ref>

====Patricia Robertson====

In the 2003 Venom series, Patricia Robertson was a communications specialist for the U.S. Army stationed at a radar installation in Canada near the Arctic Circle. She had joined the army in order to "prove herself" but got  more than she bargained for. During a routine supply run to an outpost owned by the Ararat Corporation, she stumbled upon a grisly scene: everyone at the installation was dead except for one lone scientist locked in the freezer. She brought the survivor back to base for medical attention, then people began dying there as well. It was revealed that the Ararat Corporation was run by an alien colony of miniature spider robots that infiltrated the American government. These creatures were partially led by an entity named Bob. 

These creatures had cloned Venom in order to fulfill their objective: extermination of the human race. The clone would burn out its hosts' life, unlike the real Venom (traits which seem to be a throwback to the invading symbiotes seen in Planet of the Symbiotes). Bob had the clone released and it caused the slaughter of the outpost. 

The Venom clone hitched a ride on the survivor back to base, despite the best efforts of Robertson and her new ally. The mysterious Suit was made of the same robots as Bob, which was revealed to have been unwittingly brought to Earth by cybernetically altered her, shaving her head, attaching a metal pipe in it, and placing a control collar on her so that in case the symbiote clone bonded with her she could control it. Meanwhile, Ararat Co. and the spider-robots nuked Voici, Canada leaving the symbiote with few options. After the Suit sabotaged the symbiote's favored host, Wolverine, it was forced to jump to the last surviving potential host, Robertson. 

One of Bob’s agents, disguised as the Suit, told Robertson that she had to kill the real Venom or the symbiotes would destroy all of humanity. Attempting to get to Venom, she freed him from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Their first fight was broken up by the real Suit, and the electrocuted Venom retreated. The Suit chided Robertson for coming to New York due to there being many people in the city and all of the population could be in danger if the symbiote clone jumped hosts. 

Meanwhile, Bob remotely deactivated Patricia's control collar so that nothing restrained the symbiote but Patricia's willpower. Robertson continued trying to kill Venom, beating up Spider-Man when he got in the way. She was captured by the Fantastic Four, who used her as bait to lure Venom into a trap. Unfortunately, Spider-Man’s interference and the strength and craftiness of Venom caused the trap to fail. Fighting again, Venom absorbed Robertson’s symbiote clone, as Bob hoped, and increased in size and decided to carry out the Ararat Corporation's goals. Patricia's fate is uncertain, and the entire plot has gone unresolved.

====Angelo Fortunato====
Angelo was the youngest son of symbiote from Eddie Brock for $100 million. Eddie warns of the dangers inherent in the symbiote to which the boy answers that he had nothing to lose in a life of non-stop ridicule.

Like Spider-Man, Angelo becomes the only other Venom host not to have a protruding tongue. Once bonded with the symbiote, Angelo learns the secret identity of Spider-Man, and plans to destroy him to prove himself worthy of his father. Angelo attacks Peter Parker during a high school reunion, injuring many bystanders in the process. They engage in a ferocious battle which brings them out into the streets of New York. Learning how to use the symbiote's mimetic abilities faster than anticipated Angelo takes the advantage in the fight. However, when Angelo kills an innocent civilian he mistakes for Spider-Man, the superhero stops holding back and beats Angelo into submission.

In defeat Angelo's old cowardly ways show through and he flees while the symbiote berates him for his cowardice. Irritated by the boy's lack of resolve, the symbiote ruthlessly abandons Angelo in mid-leap, letting him fall to his death. Ironically, Angelo's name translates from Italian into ''"Fortunate Angel"''.

* Angelo Fortunato appears in ''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance'' as a Marvel Knights skin for Venom.
* In the Spider-Man 3'', Eddie Brock dies in a similar manner to Fortunato, having the symbiote abandon him in midfall.

==Abilities==

Though it requires a living host in order to survive, the Venom symbiote has been shown on some occasions to be able to fend for itself with its own set of unique powers. The symbiote, without a host, has shown shape-shifting abilities like forming spikes and expanding its size.

The symbiote is telepathic and does not require physical contact to influence the minds of others. In ''Planet Of The Symbiotes'', the creature, after being rejected by its host, emits a psychic scream which drives nearby humans to states of extreme depression. Later, with the assistance of Eddie Brock, it emits an even more powerful variant of that power which results in the mass suicide of an invasive force of symbiotes. The symbiote can also blend with any background, using an optic-camouflage type of effect. Venom is immune to the Penance Stare, an ability used by Ghost Rider Johnny Blaze and Daniel Ketch.

The symbiote originally rejected its species habit of consuming its hosts, but still required certain chemicals (human adrenaline) in order to survive. When starved of these chemicals, the symbiote developed a mutable exoskeleton, allowing it to form its own solid body which it use to hunt and kill prey without the assistance of a host. Later the suit's evolution progressed and as shown in the 2003 Venom comic book series, its clone could spontaneously jump from host to host and killed them after every departure from said hosts.

==Change in appearance==
The Venom Symbiote gives each of its hosts a slightly different appearance in their Venom forms, though each is relatively similar. Initially when Venom first formed with Eddie Brock the creature was portrayed as black, considerably taller and much more muscular than Spider-Man. Over the years however, the general design of Venom has altered, even with the same host. Its eyes resembled those of the Spider-Man suit but larger and more "evil" in appearance. Its trademark was a wide grin which displayed all of his teeth.

In his most famous incarnation he developed a long tongue, he also started being drawn as blue or blue-black as opposed to the original black. His eyes became more menacing and "alien" like, while his size increased to that which would be extremely difficult for Brock to obtain through even his most rigorous weight lifting. Also the spider symbol on its chest has been known to change appearance, which the symbol of the back and front connected or not. John Romita Jr's design had Venom much leaner with abnormally long fingers. Mike Deodato's recent design of the Mac Gargan Venom has normal-human eyes within large white patches resembling Venom's traditional Spider-Man like eyes. The Gargan Venom has also been drawn as purple, much like the Venom in ''Ultimate Spider-Man''.
