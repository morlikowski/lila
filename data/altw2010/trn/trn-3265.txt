'''鉄砲水'''（てっぽうみず）とは、河川などの非常に急激な出水・増水のこと。水害の原因のひとつ。広義には河川以外への水の急激な流出を指すこともあるが、それらは'''洪水'''と呼ばれることが多い。

==発生のメカニズム==
主に、集中豪雨などによってダムなどにたまった大量の水が、そのせき止めていたものの決壊によって一気に流れ出すことによって起こる。地形の険しい山間部で起こることが多い。土砂崩れによってせき止められた水が一気に流れ出る場合もある。通常の洪水に比べて水の勢いが強いため、石などの重いものが比較的速いスピードで運搬され、頑丈な建造物が破壊される場合がある。

==対策==
豪雨の時には自治体などから避難勧告が発令されたり、地鳴りなどの異常を感じたらすみやかに避難することと、自治体などの避難体制の整備が必要である。

A '''flash flood''' is a rapid flooding of geomorphic lowlying areas - washes, rivers and streams - caused by the intense rainfall associated with a thunderstorm, or multiple thunderstorms. Flash floods can also occur after the collapse of an ice dam, or a human structure, such as a dam, for example, the Johnstown Flood of 1889.  Flash floods are distinguished from a regular flood by a timescale less than six hours.

==Causes==
Flash flooding occurs when the ground becomes saturated with water that has fallen too quickly to be absorbed.  The runoff  collects in low-lying areas and rapidly flows downhill.  Flash floods most often occur in normally dry areas that have recently received precipitation, but may be seen anywhere downstream from the source of the precipitation - even dozens of miles from the source.

Flash floods may occur after a volcanic eruption as a result of the change in weather such as thunderstorms and the soil getting over soaked.

==Hazards==
The United States National Weather Service gives the advice "Turn Around, Don't Drown" in reference to flash floods; that is, it recommends that people get out of the area of a flash flood, rather than trying to cross it. Most people tend to underestimate the dangers of flash floods.

Flash floods are extremely dangerous because of their sudden nature. Being in a vehicle provides little to no protection against being swept away; it may make people overconfident and less likely to avoid the flash flood. More than half of the fatalities attributed to flash floods are people swept away in vehicles when trying to cross flooded intersections.<ref> {{cite web

The desert southwestern U.S. is especially dangerous for both hikers and vehicles from the sudden onslaught of water from isolated thunderstorms.  These rains fill poorly-absorbent and often clay-like dry riverbeds.  A moving flood will usually be headed by a debris pile that may have wood branches and/or logs. Deep slot canyons can be especially dangerous to hikers as they may be flooded by a storm that occurs on a mesa miles away, sweeping through the canyon, making it difficult to climb up and out of the way to avoid the flood. Valley roads frequently cross dry river and creek beds without bridges.  From the driver's perspective, there may be clear weather, when unexpectedly a river forms ahead of or around the vehicle in a matter of seconds.<ref></ref>
