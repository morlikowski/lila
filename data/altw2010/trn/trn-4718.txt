==Content and writing==
The album was mainly written and recorded in the girls' home in German songwriter Madonna) and John Feldmann (who has worked with Good Charlotte and The Used).<ref name="writing"/> The songwriting saw the girls write about personal things in life mainly to do with love. The song "Revenge Is Sweeter (Than You Ever Were)" is about a person who Lisa Origliasso dated overseas, she states "When it comes down to it, that song's about cheating. A lot of people have been through it, like I've been through it, so it was very easy to relate to that situation. And I saw that whole situation go on, so it wasn't hard to write that song with her."<ref name="writing"/> Another personal song includes "In Another Life", is the most emotional song they've ever written. Lisa states that "While recording this song we couldn't sing it properly becausse we were balling our eyes out". Jess says "You actually hear me sniffing in the background".<ref name="writing"/>

In the song "Take Me on the Floor", the girls state that they "want to kiss a girl". Lisa states "Yeah, there's a sexual undertone to that song, but when we were writing it we were thinking about having fun, going to a club, being on the dancefloor. You can interpret it how you like."<ref name="Q&a">[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22718745-5006024,00.html Cameron Adams "The Veronicas dish the dirt"]. ''Herald Sun''. Retrieved November 30 2007.</ref> Jessica states "It would have been so easy to have made a record just like the first, with unison voices on the verse and chorus. It worked for us on the first record; it became a trademark sound. Not degrading it, we loved it, but at some point you have to grow as an artist or you get stuck."<ref name="Q&a"/> Lisa states "We made that record [''The Secret Life Of...''] two years ago. It would be so dated to do it again. I feel we're staying current but staying ourselves. It was a natural progression. We wanted a challenge, to take it somewhere new. People had become used to our sound. Other artists released that sound using songs we'd written. We get asked, "Did you get pushed into this sound?" We were doing the pushing!".<ref name="Q&a"/>

K. Ross Hoffman of ''The Herald Sun'' also gave the album a positive review, stating that "this is one twisted, subversive pop album."<ref name="Herland Sun Hit">[http://www.heraldsunhit.com.au/product/hook_me_up_1595186_209663.html Cameron Adams "Hook Me Up - Album review"]. ''Herald Sun''. Retrieved January 28 2007.</ref> He also states "It's not as laden with obvious hits as their debut, and takes more risks than most young pop stars would. In a word: brash."<ref name="Herland Sun Hit"/>
