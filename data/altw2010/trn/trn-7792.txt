'''''Comix Zone''''' est un ''1995 sur Megadrive. 

== Scenario ==
Le joueur dirige Sketch Turner, un dessinateur de méchant habituel des BD de Sketch qui a pris le pouvoir et qui lui impose des épreuves, qui dessine directement sur les planches (le décor du jeu) les ennemis au fur et à mesure de l'avancement dans les cases.

== Gameplay ==
Le joueur dirige donc Sketch dans des niveaux en forme de planche de bande dessinée, il passe de case en cases (sans suivre forcément le sens de lecture occidental), ramasse des objets (qui peuvent servir à récupérer de l'energie, ou à ouvrir de nouveaux passages vers des cases autrement inaccessibles), combat des monstres à travers une gamme de coup assez étendue. L'utilisation possible d'objets pour déclencher des mécanismes donne un côté « jeu d'aventure », et la gamme de coups possibles et la possibilité de parer les coups adverses le font s'approcher du « jeu de combat ».

==Conversions==
*Le jeu est converti après sa sortie sur Megadrive en 1995 sur :
**PC
**2002) Cette version est légèrement différente de l'originale à cause de la taille limitée de l'écran.

 is a arcade-style level consists of two "pages" and secrets are discovered by shredding the "paper" and revealing items. The unique dialogue is rendered within talk bubbles with the typical comic font. Sprites and backgrounds possess the bright colors and dynamic drawing style favored by superhero comics.

The music was composed by movie composer. Graphics were done mainly by comic artists.

The game was originally from a concept video animated by Peter Morawiec titled "Joe Pencil Trapped In The Comix Zone". The video was made in 1992, displaying the animation of how the gameplay and the comic book elements would blend in.

==Story==
, "starving artist" and freelance rock musician, is working on his newest comic book, named the "Comix Zone." Comix Zone is the story of the New World Empire's attempt to defend Earth from an invasion of alien renegades, with inspiration coming from Sketch's (oddly vivid) dreams and nightmares.

One night, while Sketch is working on Comix Zone during a storm, a massive lightning bolt strikes outside his apartment, somehow affecting the comic book too. In this instant, the main villain of Comix Zone - a powerful mutant named Mortus - manages to escape the comic book's pages, and hurl the stunned Sketch into the world of Comix Zone. Mortus intends to free himself by destroying Sketch in the comic book, as he is unable to do so in reality.

Inside the comic book, Sketch meets General Alissa Cyan, who believes he is a superhero ("the chosen one") who has come to save their post-apocalyptic world from the evil of Mortus and the alien invaders. Ignoring Sketch's protests, Alissa sends him on his mission, keeping in touch with instructions and hints via radio.

Now that Mortus has a physical presence outside of Comix Zone, he is free to change the world as he wishes, simply by drawing in enemies for Sketch to face - or in one instance burn up part of a page.

In the final (and partly unfinished) panel, Sketch finds a nuke ready to launch, and Alissa is working on defusing it.  Enraged, Mortus zaps himself back into the Comix Zone and shuts Alissa inside the nuke, which starts to fill with liquid.  Sketch must now defeat Mortus for good and try and prevent Alissa from drowning.

== Gameplay==
Sketch is capable of tearing shreds out of the backdrop and folding them into paper planes to throw at enemies as a weapon. Because this paper world is also part of everything within Comix Zone (as they are drawn on it), this action takes a significant slice off the player's health bar. Certain combos will send enemies hurtling, and if a fragile border between frames is in the way, the enemy crashes through it, tearing it to shreds. When confronted with an unbreakable frame barrier, the hero merely swings himself out of the frame, over the top of the border, and back down into the next scene. Sketch's pet rat Roadkill (whom he saved from certain doom in a garbage truck) is also capable of operating switches and discovering items hidden in panels, making him useful in helping Sketch's progress through Mortus' traps.

The game has multiple endings decided by actions taken during the final fight with Mortus. In the "good" ending, which is triggered by defeating Mortus and freeing Alissa in time, shows Sketch and Alissa leaving Comix Zone. Comix Zone becomes the highest selling comic of all time, Alissa joins the military and becomes the head of U.S Security, and Roadkill gets 100 pounds of mozzarella donated to him. In the bad ending, Sketch escapes Comix Zone, but because the player doesn't save Alissa, she dies and Comix Zone is destroyed. The story ends with Sketch contemplating re-releasing the evil to re-live his adventure in hope of a better ending.

If Sketch dies before reaching the final panel, Mortus will turn from ink and paper to flesh and bone, and "rock the real world".

==General notes on the game==

Mortus does intend to give Sketch a 'sporting chance'. After the first page, if Sketch dies, Mortus will allow Sketch another chance to complete the page from the first panel, stating "Oh, come on -- that was just too easy!" After the second page, Sketch will get one more chance. If Sketch still has a chance at completing the game, his last words will be "Is this the end of the story?" If he has no such chances, his last words will simply be "Game over, man. The end."

As part of Sketch's travel into Comix Zone, he takes the hero's role in the story, giving him access to typical superhero fighting skills far beyond his regular abilities. If he attacks an immobile object, Sketch's health will diminish slightly, meaning that if he is low on health other tools such as explosives should be used to continue instead. One power-up - a collectible fist - temporarily transforms Sketch into Super Sketch, who shreds the page and destroys all enemies and obstacles in his path.

Comix Zone is designed to be used with the 6-button gamepad: buttons X, Y and Z correspond to the three inventory slots Sketch has. If used with a 3-button gamepad, button C cycles through the items, and button A activates the item. Button C on a 6-button gamepad is used for a custom action, blocking by default - on a 3-button gamepad, Sketch blocks automatically.
