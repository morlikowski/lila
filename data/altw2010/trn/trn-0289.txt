'''Joseph "Joe" Crede ''' (born April 26, 1978 in Jefferson City, Missouri) is an American Major League Baseball player who is currently the starting third baseman for the Chicago White Sox.

Crede attended high school at Fatima High School in Westphalia, Missouri<ref name="mlb1">The Official Site of The Chicago White Sox, [http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=150317 Biography and Career Highlights: Joe Crede], mlb.com, Retrieved on July 7, 2008.</ref> where he led them to 3 district championships (1993, 1995, 1996) and two final four berths ('95, '96) as a pitcher.  Crede was drafted by the White Sox in the 5th round of the 1996 amateur draft and made his debut with the team in 2000. Joe Crede recently signed a one-year contract with the Sox for $5.15 million, successfully avoiding arbitration.

Crede was a member of the White Sox when they won the World Series in 2005, their first championship in eighty-eight years.  The highlight of his postseason came in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series when he hit a game-winning RBI double in the bottom of the ninth inning.

On the 3/6/07 show of ECW, Crede was seen along with other members of the White Sox in the audience. He was asked who he wanted to see get their head shaved, Donald Trump or Vince McMahon, and he enthusiastically said McMahon. Crede missed the rest of the 2007 season due to season ending lower back surgery.

==Baseball Career==
Offensively, Crede has been less consistent.  Though his home run totals have increased every year since he joined the majors, his career batting average is only .258.  He completed the 2006 season batting .283 and had career highs with 30 HR and 94 RBI, winning the 2006 Silver Slugger Award for third base. He also hits very well in the clutch, and is dubbed "Joe Joe, the Late Inning Hero" by White Sox commentators Ken Harrelson and Darrin Jackson. On April 18th, 2007, Crede recorded an assist on the final out of Pitcher Mark Buehrle's no-hitter.

On July 7, , Crede became an all-star for the first time in his career, selected as a reserve to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game.<ref name="allstar"></ref>

'''ジョー・クリーディ'''（'''Joe Crede''', ジェファーソンシティ出身。

に、ドラフト5巡目でホワイトソックスから指名を受け、プロ入り。に、メジャーデビューを果たした。頃から、レギュラー格の選手として起用され始め、徐々に才能が開花。に、自身初の20本塁打をクリアし、その2年後のには、下位打線のバッターながら30本塁打を放った。

打撃面では早打ちの傾向が強い選手。その為、四球・三振共にそれほど多くない。足の速さは平均以下。守備面では、以前はムラのある雑な守備という印象が強かったが、最近はレベルが上がってきており、守備範囲の広さはメジャー全体でも上位につける。

守備が優れている上、下位打線のバッターとしては勿体無いくらいの打力を備えた選手だが、持病に腰痛がある。
