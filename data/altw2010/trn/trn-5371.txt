The status of '''creation and evolution in public education''' can be the subject of substantial debate in legal, political, and religious circles. The situation ranges from countries not allowing teachers to discuss the evidence for evolution or the modern evolutionary synthesis, which is the scientific theory that explains evolution, to allowing evolutionary biology to be taught like any other scientific discipline. 

While some religions do not have theological objections to the modern evolutionary synthesis as an explanation for the present form of life on Earth, there has been much conflict over this matter within the Abrahamic religions, some adherents of which are vigorously opposed to the consensus view of the scientific community. Conflict with evolutionary explanations is greatest in literal interpretations of religious documents, and resistance to teaching evolution is thus related to the popularity of these more literalist views.

In Western countries, the inclusion of evolution in science courses has been mostly uncontroversial, with the exception of parts of the Supreme Court has ruled the teaching of lower court.

Muslims have been particularly resistant to teaching biological evolution.<ref name=Edis>{{cite web

==United States==
In the United States, creationists and proponents of evolution are engaged in a long-standing battle over the legal status of creation and evolution in the public school science classroom.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32444-2005Mar13.html Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens]</ref>

===Early law===
Until the late 19th century, creation was taught in nearly all schools in the United States, often from the position that the literal interpretation of the inerrant. With the widespread acceptance of the theory of evolution in the 1860s after being first introduced in 1859, and developments in other fields such as reconciled with Christianity by most people, but considered by a number of early fundamentalists to be directly at odds with the Bible.

In the aftermath of states introduced legislation prohibiting the teaching of evolution. By 1925, such legislation was being considered in 15 states, and passed in some states, such as Tennessee. The American Civil Liberties Union offered to defend anyone who wanted to bring a test case against one of these laws.  John T. Scopes accepted, and he taught his Tennessee class evolution in defiance of the Butler Act. The textbook in question was ''Hunter's Civic Biology'' (1914).

The trial was widely publicized by H. L. Mencken among others, and is commonly referred to as the Scopes Monkey Trial.

Scopes was convicted; however, the widespread publicity galvanized proponents of evolution.

When the case was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court, the Court overturned the decision on a technicality (the judge had assessed the fine when the jury had been required to). Although it overturned the conviction, the Court decided that the law was not in violation of the First Amendment. The Court held,

<blockquote>
"We are not able to see how the prohibition of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory."  Scopes v. State 289 S.W. 363, 367 (Tenn. 1927).
</blockquote>

The interpretation of the Establishment clause up to that time was that Congress could not establish a particular religion as the ''State'' religion. Consequently, the Court held that the ban on the teaching of evolution did not violate the Establishment clause, because it did not establish one religion as the "State religion."  As a result of the holding, the teaching of evolution remained illegal in Tennessee, and continued campaigning succeeded in removing evolution from school textbooks throughout the United States.<ref>s:Kitzmiller v.

=== Modern legal cases ===
right|thumb|The Supreme Court of the United States has made several rulings regarding evolution in public education.
In 1967, the Tennessee public schools were threatened with another lawsuit over the Butler Act's constitutionality, and, fearing public reprisal, Tennessee's legislature repealed the Butler Act. In the following year, 1968, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Epperson v. Arkansas that Arkansas's law prohibiting the teaching of evolution was in violation of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court held that the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from advancing any religion, and determined that the Arkansas law which allowed the teaching of creation while disallowing the teaching of evolution advanced a religion, and was therefore in violation of the 1st amendment Establishment clause. This holding reflected a broader understanding of the Establishment Clause: instead of just prohibiting laws that established a state religion, the Clause was interpreted to prohibit laws that furthered religion. Opponents, pointing to the previous decision, argued that this amounted to judicial activism.

In reaction to the Epperson case, creationists in Louisiana passed a law requiring that public schools should give "equal time" to "alternative theories" of origin. The Supreme Court ruled in Edwards v. Aguillard that the Louisiana statute, which required creation to be taught alongside evolution every time evolution was taught, was unconstitutional.

The Court laid out its rule as follows:

<blockquote>
"The Establishment Clause forbids the enactment of any law 'respecting an establishment of religion.' The Court has applied a three-pronged test to determine whether legislation comports with the Establishment Clause. First, the legislature must have adopted the law with a secular purpose. Second, the statute's principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Third, the statute must not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion. Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-613, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2111, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971). State action violates the Establishment Clause if it fails to satisfy any of these prongs."  Edwards v. Aguillard 482 U.S. 578, *582-583, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 2577 (U.S.La.,1987).
</blockquote>

The Court held that the law was not adopted with a secular purpose, because its purported purpose of "protecting academic freedom" was not furthered by limiting the freedom of teachers to teach what they thought appropriate; ruled that the act was discriminatory because it provided certain resources and guarantees to "creation scientists" which were not provided to those who taught evolution; and ruled that the law was intended to advance a particular religion because several state senators that had supported the bill stated that their support for the bill stemmed from their religious beliefs.

While the Court held that creationism is an inherently religious belief, it did not hold that every mention of creationism in a public school is unconstitutional:

<blockquote>
"We do not imply that a legislature could never require that scientific critiques of prevailing scientific theories be taught. Indeed, the Court acknowledged in Stone that its decision forbidding the posting of the Ten Commandments did not mean that no use could ever be made of the Ten Commandments, or that the Ten Commandments played an exclusively religious role in the history of Western Civilization. 449 U.S., at 42, 101 S.Ct., at 194. In a similar way, teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to schoolchildren might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction. But because the primary purpose of the Creationism Act is to endorse a particular religious doctrine, the Act furthers religion in violation of the Establishment Clause."  Edwards v. Aguillard 482 U.S. 578, 593-594, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 2583 (U.S.La.,1987)
</blockquote>

Just as it is permissible to discuss the crucial role of religion in medieval European history, creationism may be discussed in a civics, current affairs, philosophy, or comparative religions class where the intent is to factually educate students about the diverse range of human political and religious beliefs. The line is crossed ''only'' when creationism is taught ''as science'', just as it would be if a teacher were to proselytize a particular religious belief.

===Movements to teach creationism in schools===
right|thumb|[[Richard Dawkins is a strong opponent of teaching intelligent design.]]
There continue to be numerous efforts to introduce creationism in US classrooms. One strategy is to declare that evolution is a religion, and therefore it should not be taught in the classroom either, or that if evolution is a religion, then surely creationism as well can be taught in the classroom.<ref>evolution is a fact. We are convinced that evolution is a religion masquerading as science and should not be part of any science curriculum.''" and "''It is my contention that evolutionism is a religious world view that is not supported by science, Scripture, popular opinion, or common sense. The exclusive teaching of this dangerous, mind-altering philosophy in tax-supported schools, parks, museums, etc., is also a clear violation of the First Amendment.''"</ref>

In the 1980s naturalistic one, though science is defined by searching for natural explanations for phenomena. This book, and his subsequent efforts to encourage and coordinate creationists with more credentials was the start of the "Intelligent design" movement. Intelligent design asserts that there is evidence that life was created by an "intelligent designer" (mainly that the physical properties of an object are so complex that they must have been "designed"). Proponents claim that ID takes "all available facts" into account rather than just those available through naturalism. Opponents assert that ID is a pseudoscience because its claims cannot be tested by experiment (see falsifiability) and do not propose any new hypotheses.

Many proponents of the ID movement support requiring that it be taught in the public schools. For example, conservative think-tank<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/national/21evolve.html</ref>, The Discovery Institute and Phillip E. Johnson, support the policy of "Teach the Controversy", which entails presenting to students evidence for and against evolution, and then encouraging students to evaluate that evidence themselves.

While many proponents of ID believe that it should be taught in schools, other creationists believe that legislation is not appropriate.  Answers in Genesis has said:

<blockquote>
"AiG is not a lobby group, and we oppose legislation for compulsion of creation teaching ... why would we want an atheist forced to teach creation and give a distorted view? But we would like legal protection for teachers who present scientific arguments against the sacred cow of evolution such as staged pictures of peppered moths and forged embryo diagrams ..."<ref>[http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2004/1201debate.asp Jason Lisle vs. Eugenie Scott on CNN!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
</blockquote>

Opponents point out that there is no ''scientific'' controversy, but only a political and religious one, therefore "teaching the controversy" would only be appropriate in a social studies, religion, or philosophy class. Many, such as flat earthism, since the scientific consensus regarding these issues is identical. Dawkins has stated that teaching creationism to children is akin to child abuse.<ref>''The God Delusion'', Richard Dawkins, Bantam Press, 2006, ISBN-10: 0593055489.</ref>

In June 2007 the Council of Europe's "Committee on Culture, Science and Education" issued a report, ''The dangers of creationism in education'', which states "Creationism in any of its forms, such as 'intelligent design', is not based on facts, does not use any scientific reasoning and its contents are pathetically inadequate for science classes."<ref name=coe_report></ref> In describing the dangers posed to education by teaching creationism, it described intelligent design as "anti-science" and involving "blatant scientific fraud" and "intellectual deception" that "blurs the nature, objectives and limits of science" and links it and other forms of creationism to denialism.

=== Recent developments in state education programs ===

====Alabama====
In 1996, the Alabama State Board of Education adopted a textbook sticker that was a disclaimer about evolution. It has since been revised and moderated.<ref>[http://www.alscience.org/disclaimer.html Alabama Citizens for Science Education<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

====Kansas====
On August 11, 1999, by a 6–4 vote the Kansas State Board of Education changed their science education standards to remove any mention of "biological macroevolution, the age of the Earth, or the origin and early development of the Universe", so that evolutionary theory no longer appeared in state-wide standardized tests and "it was left to the 305 local school districts in Kansas whether or not to teach it."<ref name=AGI>[http://www.agiweb.org/gap/legis106/evolution.html AGI Update on Challenges to the Teaching of Evolution (3-18-01)]</ref> This decision was hailed by creationists, and sparked a statewide and nationwide controversy with scientists condemning the change.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/03/08/creationism.vs.evolution CNN.com Evolution-creation debate grows louder with Kansas controversy]</ref> Challengers in the state's Republican primary who made opposition to the anti-evolution standards their focus were voted in on August 1, 2000, so on February 14, 2001, the Board voted 7–3 to reinstate the teaching of biological evolution and the origin of the earth into the state's science education standards.<!--can't see this next bit in the reference! reversed its decision and rejected a compromise on Intelligent Design put forward by the creationist backers of the original 1999 decision.--><ref name=AGI/>

In 2004 Kansas Board of Education elections gave religious conservatives a majority and, influenced by the Discovery Institute, they arranged the Kansas evolution hearings. On August 9, 2005, the Kansas State Board of Education drafted new "science standards that require critical analysis of evolution – including scientific evidence refuting the theory,"<ref>[http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/8/112006d.asp News from Agape Press]</ref> which opponents analyzed as effectively stating that intelligent design should be taught.<ref>[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/the_kansas_stan.html The Kansas standards DO include ID]</ref> The new standards also provide a definition of science that does not preclude supernatural explanations, and were approved by a 6-4 vote on November 8, 2005 – the same day, interestingly, on which the Dover school board members were voted out (see above).

In Kansas' state Republican primary elections on August 1, 2006, moderate Republicans took control away from the anti-evolution conservatives,<ref>[http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/15175001.htm AP Wire | 08/02/2006 | Conservatives lose majority on State Board of Ed]</ref> leading to an expectation that science standards which effectively embraced intelligent design and cast doubt on Darwinian evolution would now be changed.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/05/AR2006080500718.html Nothing Wrong With Kansas]</ref>

On February 13, 2007, the Kansas State Board of Education approved a new curriculum which removed any reference to Intelligent Design as part of science. In the words of Dr Bill Wagnon, the board chairman, "Today the Kansas Board of Education returned its curriculum standards to mainstream science". The new curriculum, as well as a document outlining the differences with the previous curriculum, has been posted on the Kansas State Department of Education's website.<ref>[http://www.ksde.org/Default.aspx?tabid=144 Kansas Curricular Standards for Science]</ref>

====Kentucky====
In October 1999, the Kentucky Department of Education replaced the word "evolution" with "change over time" in state school standards.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/03/08/creationism.vs.evolution CNN.com - Evolution-creation debate grows louder with Kansas controversy - March 8, 2000<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

====Ohio====
In 2002, proponents of intelligent design asked the Ohio Board of Education to adopt intelligent design as part of its standard biology curriculum, in line with the guidelines of the Edwards v. Aguillard holding. In December 2002, the Board adopted a proposal that permitted, but did not require, the teaching of intelligent design.

====Georgia====
In Georgia in the case ACLU of Georgia, said "The progress of church-state cases has been that the [U.S.] Supreme Court sets a line, then government entities do what they can to skirt that line. ... Here the Supreme Court has said you can't teach creationism in the public schools. You can't have an equal-time provision for evolution and creationism. These disclaimers are a new effort to skirt the line." Jefferey Selman, who brought the lawsuit, claims "It singles out evolution from all the scientific theories out there. Why single out evolution?  It has to be coming from a religious basis, and that violates the separation of church and state." The School Board said it adopted the sticker "to foster critical thinking among students, to allow academic freedom consistent with legal requirements, to promote tolerance and acceptance of diversity of opinion and to ensure a posture of neutrality toward religion."

On December 20, 2006, the Cobb County Board of Education abandoned all of its legal activities and will no longer mandate that biology texts contain a sticker stating "evolution is a theory, not a fact."  Their decision was a result of compromise negotiated with a group of parents, represented by the ACLU, that were opposed to the sticker. The parents agreed, as their part of the compromise, to withdraw their legal actions against the board.<ref>http://www.latimes.com/news/education/la-na-evolution20dec20,1,1277638.story?coll=la-news-learning</ref>

On January 14, 2005, a federal judge in Atlanta ruled that the stickers should be removed as they violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.<ref>[http://msnbc.msn.com/ID/6822028/ Judge nixes evolution textbook stickers - Science - MSNBC.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The school board subsequently decided to appeal the decision.<ref>http://www.ajc.com/search/content/auto/epaper/editions/today/news_14ce5b3b4491d02d0025.html</ref><ref>[http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2005/0120cobb.asp The sticker didn't stick (or did it?)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In comments on December 15, 2005 in advance of releasing its decision, the appeal court panel appeared critical of the lower court ruling and a judge indicated that he did not understand the difference between evolution and abiogenesis.<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/942395631.html?dids=942395631:942395631&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec+16%2C+2005&author=Ellen+Barry&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=A.22&desc=THE+NATION%3B+Appeals+Panel+Criticizes+Evolution+Ruling%3B+A+federal+district+judge+had+ordered+the+removal+of+stickers+in+a+Georgia+county%27s+science+textbooks+that+called+evolution+a+theory.

====Pennsylvania====
In Aguillard precedent. Supporters of the school board's position noted that the Aguillard holding explicitly allowed for a variety of what they consider "scientific theories" of origins for the secular purpose of improving scientific education. Others have argued that Intelligent Design should not be allowed to use this "loophole."<ref>[http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/dorf/20041222.html FindLaw's Writ - Dorf: Why It's Unconstitutional to Teach "Intelligent Design" in the Public Schools, as an Alternative to Evolution<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  On ruled that the Dover School Board had violated the Constitution when they set their policy on teaching intelligent design, and stated that "In making this determination, we have addressed the seminal question of whether ID is science. We have concluded that it is not, and moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents."

====Virginia====

Despite proponents urging that intelligent design should be included in the school system's science curriculum the school board of Chesterfield County Public Schools in Virginia decided on May 23, 2007, to approve science textbooks for middle and high schools which do not include the idea of intelligent design. However, during the board meeting a statement was made that their aim was self-directed learning which "occurs only when alternative views are explored and discussed", and directed that professionals supporting curriculum development and implementation are to be required "to investigate and develop processes that encompass a comprehensive approach to the teaching and learning" of the theory of evolution, "along with all other topics that raise differences of thought and opinion." During the week before the meeting, one of the intelligent design proponents claimed that "Students are being excluded from scientific debate. It's time to bring this debate into the classroom", and presented "A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism".<ref>[http://www.richmond.com/education/output.aspx?Article_ID=4707910&Vertical_ID=127&tier=1&position=5 ''Evolution vs. Intelligent Design: Chesterfield School Board takes up debate on different theories of life''], Donna C.

====Texas====

On November 7, 2007 the Texas Education Agency director of science curriculum Christine Comer was forced to resign over an e-mail she had sent announcing a talk given by an anti-Intelligent Design author. In a memo obtained under the Texas Freedom of Information act, TEA officials wrote "Ms. Comer's e-mail implies endorsement of the speaker and implies that TEA endorses the speaker's position on a subject on which the agency must remain neutral.".<ref>[http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/11/29/1129science.html News Release], State science curriculum director resigns, November 29, 2007, Retrieved 2007-12-13</ref> In response over 100 biology professors from Texas universities signed a letter to the state education commissioner denouncing the requirement to be neutral on the subject of Intelligent Design.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/5367760.html News Release], Texas biology professors voice support for evolution education, December 11, 2007, Retrieved 2007-12-13</ref>

====Florida====

On February 19, 2008, the Florida State Board of Education adopted new science standards in a 4-3 vote. The new science curriculum standards explicitly require the teaching of the "scientific theory of evolution",<ref name="Wired"></ref> whereas the previous standards only referenced evolution using the words "change over time."<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4311046&page=1 News Release], Science Standards Will Call Evolution 'Scientific Theory', February 19, 2008, Retrieved 2008-02-19</ref>

===Recent polls===
In 2000, a People for the American Way poll among Americans found that:
*29% believe public schools should teach evolution in science class but can discuss creationism there as a belief;
*20% believe public schools should teach evolution only;
*17% believe public schools should teach evolution in science class and religious theories elsewhere;
*16% believe public schools should teach creation only;
*13% believe public schools should teach both evolution and creationism in science class;
*4% believe public schools should teach both but are not sure how.

Kreationistit ovat joissakin maissa pyrkineet saamaan Yhdysvalloissa, jossa julkisissa kouluissa ei lain mukaan saa olla uskonnonopetusta. 

== Yhdysvallat ==

1960-luvulla panostamaan tehokkaammin tieteeseen ja sen laadukkaaseen opetukseen. Evoluutioteorian opetusta vastustavia lakeja kumottiin, koska ne asettivat uskonnollisia rajoituksia akateemiselle vapaudelle ja opetukselle. Luomiseen uskovien piirien vastustuksen herätti tilanne, että kouluun tuotiin evoluution opetus, muttei uskonnonopetusta. Yhdysvalloissa valtio on erotettu kirkosta eikä valtion julkiseen opetukseen kuulu uskonnon tunteja, kuten Suomessa. Reaktiona tälle Yhdysvalloissa syntyi uusi liike, joka pyrki tieteen keinoin osoittamaan evoluution virheelliseksi, jolloin heidän mukaansa jäljelle jäisi ainoastaan luomisoppi. Yhdeksi keskeisimmistä lähtölaukauksista tässä osoittautui "nuoren maan kreationismia" ja Nooan tulvaa puolustava Morrisin ja Whitcombin kirja ''The Genesis Flood'' (1961), josta lähtivät liikkeelle nykyaikaisen kreationismin suuntaukset. Pian tämän jälkeen Morris ja Gish perustivat Institute for Creation Research (ICR) -järjestön. Kreationistisia suuntauksia on syntynyt useita muitakin, myös niin sanottuja "vanhan maan" hyväksyviä suuntauksia.

===Uusimpia kampanjoita evoluutioteoriaa vastaan===
Koska Yhdysvalloissa julkisten koulujen oppitunneilla ei saa opettaa varsinkaan minkään tietyn kirkkokunnan uskontoa ja koska oikeusasteet ovat torjuneet pyrkimyksiä tuoda uskonnollisia oppeja kouluihin, ovat kreationistit pyrkineet muuttamaan järjestöjensä oppikirjoja tieteellisemmältä näyttävään suuntaan välttäen samalla mainitsemasta esimerkiksi Jumalaa ja Raamattua nimeltä. Yhdysvalloissa republikaanipuolue ja älykästä suunnittelua.

Maailmanlaajuista huomiota sai aurinkokunnan syntyyn, luonnonvalintaan ja evoluutioon poistettiin osavaltion virallisista opetussuunnitelmista. Elokuun 2000 vaaleissa kansasilaiset osoittivat tukensa myös evoluution opetuksen puolesta, ja helmikuussa 2001 evoluutioteoria palautettiin virallisesti kansasilaisten koulujen oppitunneille. 

Keväällä perustuslain vastaisena.  

Joulukuussa 2002 Ohiossa sallittiin kreationistisen teorian opetus koulujen luonnontieteen opetuksen yhteydessä. Louisianan, Teksasin, Ohion, Oklahoman ja Alabaman osavaltiossa kreationistit ovat pyrkineet tuomaan esille kantaansa vaatimalla oppikirjoihin varoituksia evoluutioteorian mahdollisesta virheellisyydestä. Teksasissa määräys kumottiin 1990.

Tammikuussa 2004 Georgian osavaltion superintendentti Cathy Cox pyrki poistamaan 'evoluutio'-sanan osavaltion kurssisuunnitelmista. Kun tästä nousi arvostelumyrsky, myös entinen presidentti Jimmy Carter jyrähti evoluutio-opetuksen puolesta, minkä seurauksena Cox joutui perumaan ehdotuksena ja palauttamaan 'evoluutio'-sanan oppitunneille.

Syyskuussa 2004 Serbian opetusministeri Ljiljana Colić sai suurta julkista huomiota vaatimalla  kouluja lopettamaan evoluution opetuksen, jollei myös "vanhatestamentillista" (”Nuoren Maan”) kreationismia oteta oppiaineeksi evoluutioteorian rinnalle. Tieteenharjoittajat, opettajat ja lasten vanhemmat nostivat arvostelumyrskyn. Pääministeri Kostunica kutsui opetusministerin puhutteluun, hallitus kumosi ”evoluutio-kiellon” ja Colić erosi.

thumb|Tuomari John Jones johti Doverin evoluutio-oikeudenkäyntiä.
Lokakuussa älykkään suunnitelman teorian olemassaolon mainitsemista uskonnon opettamiseksi luonnontieteen nimissä. Oikeudenkäynti ''Kitzmiller v. Dover'', jota jotkut tahot ovat sanoneet merkittävimmäksi sitten vuoden älykkään suunnittelun liikkeelle.

Toukokuussa 2005 Kansasin osavaltion koululautakunta piti kuulemistilaisuuden, jossa älykkään suunnittelun liikkeen edustajat esittelivät evoluution arvostelua. 8. marraskuuta  2005 Kansasin koululautakunta päätti äänin 6–4 ottaa käyttöön uudistetut tiedestandardit, joissa mahdollistetaan myös epäilyjen esittämistä darwinilaista evoluutiota kohtaan. 

Elokuussa Yhdysvaltain presidentti älykkään suunnittelun mallin sisällyttämistä opetussuunnitelmiin. Bush puhui Texasin kuvernöörinä ollessaan avoimesti kreationismin puolesta. Myös republikaalipuolueen senaattorit John McCain ja senaatin johtaja William Frist antoivat elokuussa 2005 tukensa älykkään suunnittelun opettamiselle.

Tammikuussa älykkään suunnittelun liikettä ajava Discovery-instituutti pyysi keskeyttämään kurssin tai muuttamaan sen nimen, lukio peruutti kurssin.

Helmikuussa 2006 USA:n älykkään suunnittelun mahdollistavan opetussuunnitelman. Käytännössä tämä ID-opetuksen kieltävä äänestys oli kreationistiselle älykkään suunnittelun liikkeelle kova isku, johon Doverin oikeudenkäynnilläkin katsotaan olleen vaikutusta.

=== Evoluutio ohitetaan usein ===
Viime aikoina on myös tullut ilmi julkisuuteen tavallisten opettajien ja tiedevalistajien suulla kertomuksia, että varsinkin Yhdysvaltojen eteläosissa ns. ''Raamattuvyöhykkeellä'' evoluution opettaminen on aina ollut vaikeaa. Monet aikuiset ovat kertoneet, etteivät nuorena ole saaneet lainkaan evoluutio-opetusta kouluissa. Joitain opettajia ja kouluja suorastaan painostetaan vanhempien, koululaisten ja jopa rehtorien ja kouluviranomaistenkin toimesta jättämään evoluution opetusosuus pois biologian kurssilta, vaikka se olisikin säädetty osavaltion tiedeopetus-standardeissa. Lisäksi osa opettajista ohittaa oppikirjan evoluutio-kappaleen jo etukäteen pelätessään painostusta tai kiistoja. Tässä kohden usein puhutaan ns. e-sanasta (engl. ''e-word''), jota monet käyttävät karttaessaan lausumasta ''evoluutio''-sanaa ääneen muuallakin kuin kouluissa koska kaihtavat uskovaisten voimakkaita reaktioita.  Myös miljardeja tai miljoonia vuosia ei saa aina mainita tai pyydetään karttamaan, jos esimerkiksi dinosaurusten harrastaja tai tutkija on kutsuttu kouluille esitelmöimään.
==Eurooppa==
Euroopan neuvosto vastustaa kreationismin opetusta kouluissa, mukaan lukien sen uusinta muotoa älykästä suunnittelua. Euroopan neuvoston mukaan älykäs suunnittelu ei täytä tieteen tunnusmerkkejä eikä se perustu tosiasioihin. Euroopan neuvosto kannustaa jäsenmaidensa opetusviranomaisia edistämään luonnontieteellistä tietämystä ja evoluution opetusta.<ref></ref>
