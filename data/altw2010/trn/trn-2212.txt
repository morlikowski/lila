'''Kyrillos Loukaris''' or '''Cyril Lucaris''' or '''Cyril Lucar''' (1572&ndash;June 1638) was a Greek theologian, and a native of Orthodoxy along Protestant and Calvinist lines but was opposed both from within his own communion and by the Jesuits. <ref name=BritA>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9049229 "Lucaris, Cyril."] ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 26 Mar. 2008</ref> He was the first great name in the Eastern Orthodox Church since the fall of Constantinople in 1453, and dominated its history in the 17th century.

==Life==
He was born in Candia, Crete, then a part of the Venetian Republic's maritime empire. In his youth he travelled through Europe, studying at Venice and Padua, and at Geneva where he came under the influence of the reformed faith as represented by John Calvin. Lucaris pursued theological studies in Venice and Padua, Wittenberg and Geneva where he came under the influence of Calvinism and developed strong antipathy for Roman Catholicism.<ref name=BritA/>

In 1596  Lucaris was sent to Poland by Meletios Pegas, Patriarch of Alexandria, to lead the Orthodox opposition to the Union of Brest-Litovsk, which proposed a union of  Kiev with Rome. For six years Lucaris served as professor of the Orthodox academy in Vilnius (now in Lithuania).<ref name=BritA/>

Due to Turkish oppression combined with the proselytization of the Orthodox faithful by Jesuit missionaries, there was a shortage of schools which taught the Orthodox Faith and the Greek language. Roman Catholic schools were set up and Catholic churches were built next to Orthodox ones, and since Orthodox priests were in short supply something had to be done. His first act was to found a theological seminary in Mount Athos, the ''Athoniada'' school.

==Calvinism==
However his ultimate aim was to reform the Calvinistic lines, and to this end he sent many young Greek theologians to the universities of Patriarch of Jerusalem, of the Synod of Jerusalem by which the Calvinistic doctrines were condemned. <ref name=BritA/>

Cyril was also particularly well disposed towards the Archbishops of Canterbury is extremely interesting. It was in his time that Mitrophanes Kritopoulos - later to become Patriarch of Alexandria (1636–1639) was sent to England to study.  Both Lucaris and Kritopoulos were lovers of books and manuscripts, and many of the items in the collections of books and these two Patriarchs acquired manuscripts that today adorn the Patriarchal Library. 

==Politics==
Lucaris was several times temporarily deposed and banished at the instigation of both his Orthodox opponents and the Ottoman Janissaries on June 27, 1638 aboard a ship in the Bosporus.<ref name=BritA/> His body was thrown into the sea, but it was recovered and buried at a distance from the capital by his friends, and only brought back to Constantinople after many years.<ref name=BritA/>
