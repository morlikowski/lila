== Characters ==
=== Main characters ===
; Alucard

<br/>
: The main Dracula, as it is his name spelled backwards. The alias "Alucard" is also used by Dracula in Bram Stoker's "Dracula". The leader of the Vatican's Section XIII refers to him as "el nosferatu."<ref name="dracula">''Hellsing'' manga, volume 8, </ref> In the last episode of the TV series there is a close up of Alucard's face and for a few seconds the screen splits and he resembles classical portraits of Vlad Ţepeş (Vlad III the Impaler), a voivode of Wallachia who provided the inspiration for Bram Stoker’s novel. When he first meets Incognito, he says that it is fine that Incognito's name is a puzzle, since his name is a riddle as well. 

; Seras Victoria

<br/>
: Seras was a member of the D11 special forces unit until being mortally wounded by Alucard in his destruction of a vampire masquerading as a priest. On the verge of death, she chose to allow Alucard to turn her into a vampire. Serving beneath Alucard, she now works for the Hellsing organization.

: For some time after joining the Hellsing organization, Seras avoided drinking blood, fearing the loss of her humanity (the first time she encountered her medical blood ration, she was almost overcome by bloodlust).  However, when Alucard drank the blood of a reporter in front of her, she finally acknowledged her vampiric powers and consumed blood.

; Sir Integra Wingates Hellsing

: Integra is a 22-year-old noblewoman and the head and last member of the Hellsing family. She the strong and intelligent leader of the Hellsing organization, and Alucard's "Master". She inherited the Hellsing organization at the age of 13 upon the death of her father. Although she often seems strict and domineering, she is respected and admired, even among her sworn enemies. Apparently an expert pistol shot. 

; Paladin Alexander Anderson

: A warrior Vatican Section XIII, Iscariot. Anderson is Iscariot's ultimate weapon in the fight against the undead. With regenerative capabilities and a variety of holy weapons (including his signature blessed bayonets), his mission is nothing less than the complete destruction of all the demons of Hell. As this includes many of Hellsing's subordinates, Anderson is one of Alucard's greatest foes. 

; Incognito
thumb|Incognito

: This masochistic vampire is from "the dark continent," a reference to Africa. Though physically androgynous, he is generally thought to be male.  Extremely powerful, he combines dark magic with an enchanted ArmsCor 40 mm grenade launcher that fires spines. Incognito vomits into the launcher's cartridges before loading; and he also is known to have a gatling gun as backup.  During the final plot arc of the series he summons a snake-like being referred to as Sett (presumably the Egyptian god of chaos) and takes it into his body in order to use its power to attack Alucard. Incognito has regenerative powers which seem to be related to the purple stripes and sigils covering his body. It has also been argued that, while Alucard may be inspired by, or is Count Dracula, Incognito may have been inspired by the vampire Count Orlok, from the 1922 silent movie Nosferatu. Incognito does not appear in the manga and his name comes from the literal definition of the word, incognito.

=== Secondary characters ===
;Walter C. Dornez
<br/>
: Walter is a 69 year old retired member of the Hellsing organization. Though now serving as Integra Hellsing's butler, he still has proved the capacity to live up to his nickname "The Angel of Death" with deadly razor sharp wires. He has a close friendship with both Integra and Alucard.

; Enrico Maxwell
<br/>
: Enrico Maxwell is the overzealous religious leader of the Iscariot Organization (Vatican Section XIII).
