'''Kellogg's''' ''(ou '''Kellogg Company''')'' é uma multinacional estadunidense, produtora de cereais, como o ''Frosted Flakes'' (mais conhecido como ''Sucrilhos Kellogg's''). Os lucros em 2005 foram divulgados em US$10,52 bilhões.

A '''Kellogg's''' foi fundada como a '''Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company''' ''('''Compania de flocos cereais tostados de Battle Creek''')'' em 19 de Fevereiro de 1906 por Will Keith Kellogg como fruto de seu trabalho com seu irmão John Harvey Kellogg em sanatório de Battle Creek. Essa cidade se tornou uma espécie de vale do silício do início do século XX, com várias companhias produtoras de alimentos à base de cereais se instalando ali da noite para o dia.

No sanatório que tornou Battle Creek famosa, o Dr. Kellogs prescrevia exercícios e buscava mudar os hábitos de seus ricos clientes, acostumados a comer carnes e outros pratos “pesados” no café da manhã. O doutor servia alimentos naturais e logo escolheu os cereais a base de trigo para usar na refeição matinal. Vale lembrar ainda que muitos religiosos (Quacker) também eram contra o consumo de carne, ligada tradicionalmente a crença de que ela aumentava o ardor sexual, e queriam que os crentes passassem a consumir alimentos vegetarianos. A moda de cereais veio a calhar para esses religiosos.

O cereal em flocos (flakes) surgiu de experimentações com a farinha deixada de “molho”. A empresa produziu e vendeu a altamente bem sucedida '''Kellogg's Toasted Corn Flakes''' que foi mais tarde renomeada a '''Kellogg Company''' em 1922.

A companhia possuiu a Keebler (adquirido em Kashi subdisiárias.

== History ==
thumb|left|First Kellogg's package
Kellogg's was founded as the '''Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company''' on February 19, 1906, by Will Keith Kellogg as an outgrowth of his work with his brother John Harvey Kellogg at the Battle Creek Sanitarium following practices based on the Seventh-day Adventist Christian denomination. The company produced and marketed the hugely successful Kellogg's Toasted Corn Flakes and was renamed the Kellogg Company in 1922.

In 1930, the Kellogg Company announced that most of its factories would shift towards 30 hour work weeks, from the usual 40. This practice remained until World War II, and continued briefly after the war, although some departments and factories remained locked into 30 hour work weeks until 1980. <ref></ref>

The company owns the Kellogg's, Keebler (acquired in 2001), Kashi divisions or subsidiaries. It also owns the Natural Touch, Austin, Famous Amos, Carr's, Gardenburger (acquired 2007) and Plantation brands.
