==History==
thumb|left|Eastlands during the Commonwealth Games
Plans to build a stadium in east Manchester were first formulated in around 1990 as part of the city's bid to host the brownfield site known colloquially as ''Eastlands''. However, in October 1993 the games were awarded to Sydney, Australia. Manchester subsequently made a successful bid to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games, using the stadium plans from the Olympic bid. In 1996, the planned stadium competed with Wembley Stadium to gain funding to become the national stadium but the money was used to redevelop Wembley.
The stadium's Prime Minister John Laing at a cost of approximately £110 million, £77 million of which was provided by athletics track, and second tiers to the two sides, with an open-air temporary stand at one end. The first public event at the stadium was the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games on Queen Elizabeth II. During the ten days of competition, the stadium hosted all athletics events and the 5000&nbsp;m.<ref></ref>

thumb|200px|The East Stand of the City of Manchester StadiumAfter the Commonwealth Games, extensive work was carried out on the stadium to convert it for use as a football stadium. Following the success of athletics events at the Commonwealth Games, the decision to convert the stadium into a football venue received criticism from athletics figures such as Jonathan Edwards and 2003&ndash;04 season. The conversion cost £35 million, which was paid for by the football club.

The first football match at the stadium was a friendly between Manchester City and Barcelona on goal at the stadium scored by UEFA Cup contest between Manchester City and TNS, which City won 5&ndash;0. The record football attendance at the stadium is 47,321, which was set at a Premier League game when Manchester City drew with Liverpool F.C. 0&ndash;0 on 30 December 2007.

The stadium has also hosted several other sporting events.

The stadium has a number of unofficial alternative names. ''Eastlands'' was used before the stadium was officially named and is still in common use, and ''City of Manchester Stadium'' is sometimes abbreviated to ''COMS'' when written. ''The Blue Camp'', a pun on Barcelona's Nou Camp, found little favour.<ref></ref> The stadium has generally received positive feedback from fans, coming second behind Old Trafford in a 2005 poll to find the United Kingdom's favourite football ground.<ref></ref> However, the atmosphere inside the stadium has sometimes faced criticism, with detractors regarding the atmosphere as inferior to that of Maine Road. But the atmosphere has improved as the seasons have gone by with the fans getting used to the stadium.<ref></ref>

Steel cables hold the roof in place.The interior of the City of Manchester Stadium is a continuous oval bowl, with three tiers of seating at the sides, and two tiers at each end. While the seating is continuous, each side of the stadium has its own name in the manner of a traditional football ground. Initially, all sides of the stadium were named by compass direction (''North Stand'' and ''South Stand'' for the ends, ''East Stand'' and ''West Stand'' for the sides). In February 2004 the West Stand was renamed the ''executive boxes around the stadium, located along the West, North and East Stands.
