'''Dada Bhagwan''' (Ambalal Muljibhai Patel, also known as '''Dadashri''') (Indian Spiritual personality and leader of a new religious movement. He was a native of Bhadran, Gujarat, India and inspired the Akram Vignan, a spiritual path to achieve self-realization and liberation.

==His philosophy and teachings== 
Dada believed that permanent atman and self-realization was the realization of this and knowing onself to be that. He traveled to a number of countries helping people attain self-realization through Akram Vignan by a two hour process known as gnan vidhi. He believed that it was possible to achieve self-realization and continue with the daily-life activities without any renunciation and penance. He communicated with people all over the world by holding interactive sessions on general topics relating to life and also self-realization. He said that liberation/salvation could be achieved only by knowing oneself, by being aware of ourselves rather than renunciation and hardships/penance. It is very important for an individual to live a life without conflicts and achieve permanent happiness. He believed that a particular god or individual was not the creator and operator of this world. The world works by scientific circumstantial evidences. Spirituality is a science and not a philosophy or religion that man has made a part of today. He said, “There is no relation between scriptures and knowledge. Scriptural knowledge does not bring about a conclusion; a conclusion comes from knowledge that is experienced. “ He believed that all religions are correct and equal and there should not be any discrimination on the basis of god, religions, sects, races and castes.<ref>[http://dadabhagwan.org/akram-vignan.html Dada Bhagwan Foundation]</ref>

He said that he communicated through his astral body with Simandhar Swami for answers and clarification of questions proposed to him. He said that today direct liberation from the planet Earth is no longer possible because of the effect of the current time cycle; however the path is still open but is so from Mahavideh Kshetra. Having acquired Self realization, the soul is said to begin its journey towards its ultimate liberation. Hence the next life for a Self-Realized being will be in Mahavideh Kshetra, where after the darshan of Lord Simandhar, the soul will begin its final journey to Moksha.<ref>[http://dadabhagwan.org/bhagwan-realization.html About Dada Bhagwan]</ref>

==生平简介==

艾姆巴拉尔•穆尔基巴伊•巴戴尔（达达薄伽梵）是印度古吉拉特邦科达县帕德伦镇人。1908年11月8日，他出生于他父母在塔尔斯德里镇的家中。他的母亲就像是神母贾伽达姆巴的化身。他受到了母亲很深的影响，而这种影响后来也改变了他人生的方向。

1958年7月的一天，当时50岁的他坐在苏勒特火车站3号站台的最后一张木椅上。当时是下午5点30分，他已经在日落前吃了晚饭。在接下来的一个小时中，他受到了启迪，并领悟到了有关整个宇宙的知识。在这种知识中，他获得了许多诸如“我是谁？”“什么是宇宙？”“宇宙如何运转？”“什么是神？”“神做些什么？”“神住在哪里？”等等问题的答案。由此他得以洞悉整个宇宙。当被问及他是如何实现自我启蒙的，他回答说这自然而然的就发生了。在接下来的四年中，别人并不知道他已经实现了自我认知这一事实。直到1962年，他的生意合伙人的孙子才帮助其他人打开了通往知识殿堂的大门。当被问及谁是达达薄伽梵的时候，他曾经回答道：“站在你面前的并不是达达薄伽梵；达达薄伽梵是十四个世界的主宰，他存在于你、我、他，所有人的身体中。”从此，成千上万信仰不同宗教、教派以及来自不同国家的人得以在达达薄伽梵的帮助下经历永恒的快乐。

1988年1月2日，达达薄伽梵离开了他的肉体。然而，达达薄伽梵给予了布极亚•迪布格巴伊和尼路妈两人他的祝福。通过他们，达达薄伽梵的事业依然在不断的帮助人们认识真正的自我。
