'''Camille Anna Paglia''' (born American author, teacher, feminist and social critic. Her book, ''Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson'', published in 1990, became a bestseller. Since 1984 Paglia has been a Professor at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Overview==
Paglia<ref>The "g" is silent.</ref> is an high and low, with a view that Dionysian aspect, especially the wilder, darker sides of art history and the literary canon, with a greater emphasis on facts in the teaching of history. She came to public attention in 1990, with the publication of her first book, ''Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson''. Her notoriety as the author of this book made it possible for her to write on popular culture and feminism in mainstream newspapers and magazines. Paglia challenged what she saw as the "liberal establishment", including academics, feminist advocacy groups such as National Organization for Women (NOW), and AIDS activists ACT UP.

[''Camille Paglia:''] People say this was not true, blah blah blah. I'm sorry, I happen to believe it. This information came to me very reliably. There were only two people between me and Foucault. Foucault told a famous gay writer, who told my close friend, who told me, that when he realized he had AIDS, he was so angry that he determined he would take as many with him as he could. He would take as many to death as he could. That he deliberately went to bars and would deliberately have sex with people and not tell them and try actively to take them with him.</ref><ref>"This was a man of mutilated psyche: if what I have reliably heard about his public

Paglia has called Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex "brilliant" and "the only thing undergraduate sex study needs." <ref>Paglia, ''Sex, Art, and American Culture'', p. 243</ref>, and identified Jean-Paul Sartre's work as part of a high period in literature. <ref>Paglia, ''Vamps and Tramps'', p. 427</ref> Paglia has made positive comments about parts of Roland Barthes and Gilles Deleuze's early work, while finding their later work flawed. <ref>Paglia, ''Vamps and Tramps'', p. 232</ref> Gaston Bachelard has influenced Paglia.

Paglia wrote a column for ''Interview'' magazine and is on the editorial board of the classics and humanities journal ''Arion''. Paglia is currently writing her third collection of essays and a companion volume to ''Break, Blow, Burn'' dealing with the visual arts rather than poetry.

==Biography==
Paglia is the elder daughter of Pasquale and Lydia Anne (Colapietro) Paglia. Her mother was born in Ceccano, Italy. Her father's ancestors came from Italy.

Despite their modest means, her parents exposed her to classical Western art and culture. The first music to make an impression on her was Bizet's ''Carmen'', an opera which, in her words, "struck me with electrifying force."<ref>"Music of my mind: Camille Paglia on the influence of music on her life and work," interview with Camille Paglia, "Interview Magazine",August 2002.</ref> She was three when she first heard the opera, but was still enamored of it in her writing more than 40 years later. 

Paglia spent her primary school years in rural Oxford, New York, where her family lived in a working farmhouse.<ref>"Arcadia," "The Financial Times," March 15, 1997, p22.</ref> Her father, a veteran of World War II,<ref>Pasquale J. Paglia, obit., Syracuse Herald Tribune, January 23, 1991. "Mr. Paglia served with the 511 Airborne Infantry in the Philippines and in the nine-month occupation of Japan."</ref> taught at the Oxford Academy high school. In 1957, her family moved to Syracuse, New York, so that her father could begin graduate school; he eventually became a Professor of Romance Languages at Le Moyne College. She attended the Edward Smith Elementary school, T. Aaron Levy Junior High and William Nottingham High School.<ref name="Scotsman"></ref>

By all accounts, she was an excellent student at Nottingham High School. She spent her Saturdays in the Carnegie Library, absorbed in books and manuscripts. In 1992 Carmelia Metosh, her Latin teacher for three years said "She always has been controversial. Whatever statements were being made (in class), she had to challenge them. She made good points then, as she does now. She was very alert, 'with it' in every way."<ref>"Hurricane Camille," Jim McKeever, "Syracuse Herald American" (Syracuse, New York), November 22, 1992</ref> Paglia thanked Metosh in the acknowledgements to ''Sexual Personae'', later describing her as "the dragon lady of Latin studies, who breathed fire at principals and school boards."<ref name="Scotsman" />

She attended Spruce Ridge Camp, a Girl Scout facility in the confirmation name, inspired by the film), Stacy, and Stanley. An iconic experience was the time the outhouse exploded when she poured too much lime into it. "It symbolized everything I would do with my life and work. Excess and extravagance and explosiveness. I would be someone who would look into the latrine of culture, into pornography and crime and psychopathology...and I would drop the bomb into it."<ref>"New York Observer," July 5 - 12, 1993.</ref><ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E1D8113EF933A15752C1A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 "Advertisements for Themselves"], WENDY STEINER, ''The New York Times'' November 20, 1994</ref>

Paglia discovered Simone de Beauvoir's ''The Second Sex'' in 1963. <ref>Paglia, "Sex, Art and American Culture", p. 112, 1992,</ref> It led Paglia to stop working on the book about Amelia Earhart she had been writing for three years, and to resolve to write a "mega-book that will take everything in", the beginning of what later became ''Sexual Personae''.<ref>"The M.I.T. Lecture: Crisis in the American Universities," (lecture, September 19, 1991), in "Sex, Art and American Culture," p. 259, Camille Paglia, 1992.</ref> On July 8 1963, ''Newsweek'' magazine published her letter about equal opportunity for American women. On November 24 1963, Syracuse's ''Herald American'' profiled her outstanding achievements as a student, noting her longtime study of feminist icon Amelia Earhart.

===College years===
====Binghamton University, Harpur College (1964–1968)====
She entered Binghamton University, then called Harpur College, in 1964, graduating as class valedictorian in 1968. The essays she wrote during those years on "sexual ambiguity and aggression in literature, art and history" grew into ''Sexual Personae''.

She had been writing poetry prior to entering college (her poem "Atrophy," had been published in her local newspaper in Metaphysical poetry and John Milton. She later wrote that the biggest impact on her thinking were the classes taught by poet Milton Kessler. "He believed in the responsiveness of the body, and of the activation of the senses to literature... And oh did I believe in that. Probably from my Italian background — that's the way we respond to things, with our body. From Michelangelo, Bernini, there's this whole florid physicality leading right down to the Grand Opera, the great arias."<ref>"An Interview with Camille Paglia," ''Bookslut'', April 2005, http://www.bookslut.com/features/2005_04_005030.php </ref> 

She wrote her senior thesis on Emily Dickinson, and aspired to be a poet, inspired by the work of Edna St. Vincent Millay and Gerard Manley Hopkins. She submitted a reconfiguration of the Dido episode of Virgil's Aeneid to the college literary magazine, but its editor, Deborah Tannen, rejected it, saying that "Poets don't write like this anymore."<ref>"Prickly poet still battling status quo," Margaria Fichtner, "Miami Herald," (Miami, Florida), May 8, 2005.</ref> 

At Harpur she befriended three gay men who have had a lifelong influence on her thinking: Bruce Benderson (a classmate at Nottingham High School), Stephen Jarratt, and Stephen Feld. Her father got her a summer job working the night shift at St. Joseph's Hospital in Syracuse as an emergency ward secretary. "It was unbelievable, like being in a war without any danger to myself," she later said. "I forced myself to look at every single horrible thing — once, OK? After a while, you start to adjust. It was pivotal because it's one of the reasons I'm not sentimental at all about death or disease."<ref>"Hurricane Camille," Jim McKeever, "Syracuse Herald American" (Syracuse, New York), November 22, 1992</ref> 

At Harpur, she did not fit the typical gender roles. Seeing a defenseless female student being groped on the street by two drunken men, she hit one of them in the teeth; she was 19 at the time. She was once put on probation for committing 39 pranks, a fact in which she takes pride.<ref>"My Education," by Camille Paglia, "The Scotsman," (Edinburgh, Scotland), January 26, 2000, pg. 3</ref>  She told an interviewer in 2003 that she follows the model of the "sages" because they're "actually very funny. They're funny, they're prankish. Zen masters are known to be prankish." She said, "To me, comedy is a symptom of a balanced perspective on life, and people who are going around, like gloomy gusses, in that Sontag style of intellectual, these people are suffering from something coming from their childhood, it has nothing to do with the proper intellectual response to life..."<ref>"In Depth: Camille Paglia," Book TV (C-Span2, American Television), August 3, 2003 </ref>

====Yale Graduate School (1968–1972)====
Paglia did her graduate studies at Yale just as the women's movement and gay liberation exploded into American consciousness, yet here too her sexual orientation and sexually ambiguous persona led to conflict. A friend of hers at the time, Robert Caserio, recalled in 1996:

{{quotation|
She did not act in a way that convention there dictated. Yale was an extremely genteel place. Camille wasn't genteel. She was so upfront and she wore pants in a very aggressive way. She was an out-feminist and identified with gay sexuality. We were all very much more discreet.
|Robert Caserio}} 

A few months after beginning her studies, she attended a party in the home of R. W. B. Lewis, one of her teachers, and ended up being insulted by Robert Jay Lifton and his wife for being a lesbian. Lifton was, at the time, the Foundations' Fund research professor in psychiatry at Yale, a position he held until 1984. This verbal attack seems to have emboldened her not only to be out as a lesbian, but also to be in everyone's face about it. She has repeatedly noted she was openly lesbian while at Yale Graduate School, even claiming to have been the only open lesbian there from 1968 to 1972.<ref> As told to Dan Savage, "The Stranger" (Seattle, Washington), September 28 - October 4, 1992: ''"I took the career price for that. I shoved my lesbianism down people's throats when I wasn't getting any pleasure from it; I couldn't find anyone to be with! There is the irony, I took all the negatives without any of the positives! I tried. I tried to pick up women, I tried. In 1969 I traveled Europe with the handbook, ''The Gay Guide to Europe''. I went from place to place, every city, and I thought, "What is the problem here?" All the gay men are finding contacts everywhere! You can't avoid it! Bus terminals, toilets, diners, everywhere! Finally I had to conclude, after so many decades of frustration, that lesbians are not looking for sex. It's not about sex. They think it's about sex. It's about mommy! It's about mommy is what it's about!"''</ref>

While at Yale, Paglia quarreled with nihilist", and argued with the New Haven, Connecticut Women's Liberation Rock Band when they dismissed the Rolling Stones as "sexist".<ref>"Letter to the Editor," Camille Paglia, "Chronicle of Higher Education," June 17, 1998.</ref> She also "had two close encounters with Kate Millett (author of ''Sexual Politics'') just after she became famous, in New Haven, Connecticut, and in Provincetown, Massachusetts, but she was too morosely self-absorbed to notice." Because of what she saw as Millett's "careless" attitude toward scholarship, Paglia became critical of her and those who supported her work.

Her study of sexuality in Western literature continued to develop with her reading of Edmund Spenser's ''Faerie Queene'' (1590). In 1970, she wrote a 160-page paper for her last graduate seminar at Yale entitled "Male and Female in Virginia Woolf." Her original plan for her book "Sexual Personae" was that it would end with a study of Woolf and Lawrence.<ref>Paglia, "Vamps & Tramps," p. 329, 1994.</ref> 

In Kenneth Clark's ''The Nude'' (1956) , a book which would have a profound impact on her dissertation and later work. "If ever I was in love with a book, it was with this one," she wrote in ''Sex, Art & American Culture''; and in an article for ''Women's Quarterly'' in 2002, she called it "the best introduction by far to representation of the human figure in art."<ref>''"The best introduction by far to representation of the human figure in art. The Nude is a beautifully written work of sophisticated connoisseurship that analyzes art in its own terms rather than imposing strident, politicized categories on it. It outlines the major body types, male and female, in Western art and, via a wealth of illustrations, trains the reader's eye to detect and evaluate proportion. This book reveres art — an attitude all too rare at universities these days. Students who read Clark will be safely inoculated against the worst excesses of feminist theory, with its prattle about "objectification" and "the male gaze" — terms cooked up by ideologues with glaringly little knowledge or feeling for art."''</ref>

In 1971 she received a Jane Harrison's successor as a supreme woman scholar, had become synonymous with a shallow kind of hip posturing."<ref>Paglia, "Vamps & Tramps," p. 345, 1994.</ref>

In a letter dated February 13, 1972 to Carolyn Heilbrun at Columbia University, Paglia inquired about her forthcoming book on androgyny;<ref>Letter, Camille A. Paglia to Professor Carolyn Heilbrun, February 13, 1972 (Knopf Archive, Humanities Research Center, Austin, Texas.)</ref> Heilbrun wrote back saying that her book could not deal with all available material on the subject. When asked about Paglia's letter years later, Heilbrun could not remember it.<ref> Email, Carolyn G. Heilbrun to D. Doohan, February 13, 1996: ''"I have no recollection of receiving a letter in 1972 from Paglia, which doesn't mean that I didn't. I hear she has said nasty things about me, but I haven't read them. I have no respect for her; certainly I would not have welcomed mean statements about Millett."'' Heilbrun had been informed that in the 1972 letter, Paglia has been critical of Millett, saying that her "shabby and humorless attempts at literary criticism in "Sexual Politics" have severely discredited Women's Liberation."</ref> When Heilbrun's "Toward a Recognition of Androgyny" came out, Paglia panned it in a review for the Summer 1973 issue of the ''Yale Review''. "Heilbrun's book is so poorly researched that it may disgrace the subject in the eyes of serious scholars," she wrote. She noted that "the most distinguished commentators on androgyny are Mircea Eliade and G. Wilson Knight"; and criticized Heilbrun for her reliance on the work of Joseph Campbell, and for including "four flattering references" to Kate Millett while making "fifteen glib jibes" at Sigmund Freud. The author of the review was clearly an expert on the history of androgyny, but as it was the journal's policy for reviews to be published without attribution, few knew that Paglia wrote it.

===Teaching career===
In the fall 1972, Paglia began teaching at Bennington College, which hired her in part thanks to a recommendation from Teeth" in 2007, a movie that was inspired by the myth of the vagina dentata, and was heavily influenced by Paglia's work.   Another student of hers was Mark W. Edmundson, now a professor at the University of Virginia, who in January 1997, wrote about her as follows:

{{quotation|
She was appointed as my faculty advisor in her first term. I went in for my advisorial visit and she was entirely herself, talking very fast about many things I knew nothing about. I ran in fear. Alas, I was too puzzled to take any of her classes, which seemed to be full of very sophisticated people from LA and from New York.<ref>E-mail message, Mark W. Edmundson to D. Doohan, January 23, 1997</ref>
|Professor Mark W. Edmundson}}

Writer Heidi Schmidt, who attended her classes, recalled in 1996:
{{quotation|
"She was thought of as peculiar. She was so full of excitement and so intense. She would light one cigarette and then forget about it and light another, so she was waving two cigarettes. I think people took her quite lightly, she was thought of as eccentric."
|Author Heidi Schmidt, former student of Paglia}}

Yet another Bennington student from Paglia's time there was Judith Butler, who went on to a successful academic career. In a 2005 interview, Paglia said of Butler:

{{quotation|
She was a student when I was at my first job at Bennington in the 70s, and I saw her up close. And I know what she knows. I mean, she transferred from there, to Yale, and her background in anything is absolutely minimal. She started a career in philosophy, abandoned that, and has been taken as this sort of major philosophical thinker by people in literary criticism. But has she ever made any exploration of science? For her to be dismissing biology, and to say gender is totally socially constructed — where are her readings, her studies? It's all gameplay, wordplay, and her work is utterly pernicious, a total dead-end."''<ref>"An Interview with Camille Paglia," Bookslut, April 2005, http://www.bookslut.com/features/2005_04_005030.php </ref>
|Paglia, on poststructuralist feminist Judith Butler}}

Paglia's first scholarly publication was "Lord Hervey and Pope," published in the 1973 ''18th Century Studies''. (A ''Times Literary Supplement'' cover story on Lord Hervey, November 2, praised the paper as "brilliant.").<ref>Also see her review of Robert Halsband's "Lord Hervey: Eighteenth-Century Courtier," in the journal "Scriblerian," Spring 1974.</ref> The article was a revision of a term paper she wrote. In April 1973, she attended a Susan Sontag lecture at Dartmouth College and later invited her to Bennington to speak there on October 4. The event proved controversial because Sontag read a short story instead of giving the expected cultural lecture. Paglia later commented, "I was stunned because I thought she was going to be a major intellectual", later writing at length about their meeting in an essay entitled "Sontag, Bloody Sontag", published in ''Vamps & Tramps''. Susan Sontag said of Paglia, "We used to think Norman Mailer was bad, but she makes Norman Mailer look like Jane Austen."<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1479923/Susan-Sontag.html Susan Sontag]</ref>

Another intellectual disappointment for Paglia was Marija Gimbutas, who published ''The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe'' in 1974. At the same time, Paglia launched "a detailed attack on an exhibit at Bennington's Crossett Library, 'Matriarchy: The Golden Age,' which used appallingly shoddy feminist materials alleging the existence of a peaceful, prehistoric matriarchy, later supposedly overthrown by nasty males."<ref>"Letter to the Editor," Camille Paglia, "Chronicle of Higher Education," June 17, 1998.</ref>

Through her study of the classics and the scholarly work of Erich Neumann and others, Paglia developed a theory of sexual history that contradicted a number of ideas in vogue at the time, hence her criticism of Gimbutas, Heilbrun, Millett and others. She laid out her ideas on matriarchy, androgyny, homosexuality, sadomasochism and other topics in her Yale Ph.D. thesis ''Sexual Personae: The Androgyne in Literature and Art,'' which she defended in December 1974. In September 1976, she gave a public lecture drawing on that dissertation,<ref>"Bennington Banner," September 20, 1976, announced that the lecture would take place the following day at 8:15 p.m. in Usdan Gallery in the Visual and Performing Arts Center.</ref> in which she discussed Edmund Spenser's ''Faerie Queene'', followed by remarks on Diana Ross, Gracie Allen, Yul Brynner, and Stephane Audran.<ref>In 2002, she called Stephane Audran "one of my favorite actresses" and said that "director Claude Chabrol's wife and leading lady in the '60s and '70s... prowled Parisian salons to find exactly the right handbag for a role. She'd say, 'Until I have the clothing, I don't know who the character is.'" See "Interview," November 2002.</ref>

In March 1975, she saw Albany. She was disappointed, reporting later that "During the question period, I nervously raised my hand from the crowd and asked if Greer, a former English professor, would be writing on literary subjects again soon. Her reply was stern and swift: 'There are far more important things in the world than literature!'"

In another disheartening experience, Paglia "nearly came to blows with the founding members of the chauvinists, homophobes and academics culminated in a 1978 incident that led her to resign from Bennington a year later.<ref>As explained by Paglia to Heather Findlay, in a cover story for ''Girlfriends'' magazine, September 2000. In 1978, Paglia and her lesbian partner of the time were assaulted at a Bennington dance by a male student. Paglia said "I went to the police and filed a report. Then her parents went ballistic. There was an enormous to-do from her rich parents telling the administration, 'Open homosexuals shouldn't be employed by a college. We're not sending our daughter to a place where there are gays like this on the faculty.'"'' After a lengthy standoff with the administration, Paglia accepted a settlement from the college and resigned the following year.</ref>

Paglia finished ''Sexual Personae'' in the early 1980s, but could not get it published. She supported herself with visiting and part-time teaching jobs at Yale, Wesleyan, and other Connecticut colleges. She taught night classes at the Sikorsky Helicopter plant. Her paper, "The Apollonian Androgyne and the Faerie Queen," was published in ''English Literary Renaissance'', Winter 1979, and her dissertation was cited by J. Hillis Miller in his April 1980 article "Wuthering Heights and the Ellipses of Interpretation," in ''Journal of Religion in Literature'', but her academic career was otherwise stalled at a time when her peers were moving on to important positions at major universities. In a 1995 letter to Boyd Holmes, she recalled: "I earned a little extra money by doing some local features reporting for a New Haven alternative newspaper (''The Advocate'') in the early 1980s."<ref>Feminist writer Naomi Wolf was an intern for ''The Advocate'' in the early 1980s.</ref> She wrote articles on New Haven's historic pizzerias and on an old house that was a stop on the Underground Railroad."<ref>Letter, Camille Paglia to Boyd Holmes, February 1995.</ref>  

In University of the Arts. While travelling in Europe, she wrote about German women as follows: "The women, stern-faced, melt the submissive heart...All look like Lotte Lenya!"<ref>Postcard to James Fessenden, dated August 18, 1984: "Dahlink! Never in Germany before! I rather like it. Fabulous old castle in Romantic ruins. Bavarian frivolity of architecture elsewhere. The women, stern-faced, melt the submissive heart... All look like Lotte Lenya! Paris, Geneva before— now on to Rome."</ref>

For some years, Paglia has shared a residence with the artist and teacher Allison Maddex. Paglia legally adopted the son Maddex bore in 2002.

===Paglia and Feminism===

'''Camille (Anna) Paglia''' (* New York) ist eine US-amerikanische Kunst- und Kulturhistorikerin und in der angelsächsischen Welt eine der prominentesten Autorinnen auf diesem Gebiet. Sie ist Professorin für Geisteswissenschaften und Medien (''Humanities and Media Studies'') an der University of the Arts in Philadelphia.

== Leben ==

=== Kindheit und Schulzeit ===

Camille Anna Paglia wurde am 2. April 1947 in Endicott, New York geboren. Sie war das erste Kind von Pasquale Paglia und Lydia Anna Paglia, geborene Colapietro, und wuchs in einer italienischen Einwandererfamilie auf.

Die Familie war nicht wohlhabend, aber ihre Eltern achteten darauf, sie mit dem Besten in Berührung zu bringen, was westliche Kunst und Kultur zu bieten hatten. Die erste Musik, die sie beeindruckte, soll Georges Bizets ''Carmen'' gewesen sein. Sie sagt von sich, diese Oper habe sie ''mit elektrisierender Kraft getroffen.'' Damals war sie drei Jahre alt. Im selben Jahr lernte sie die Hexe im Märchen Schneewittchen kennen, eine Figur, die sie später als elegant und königlich beschrieb.

Ihre Eltern nahmen sie häufig mit ins Museum, und ihr Vater brachte ihr von seinem Studium in Frankreich ein Buch über Kunstschätze des Louvre mit, das sie mit seinen vielen Aktbildern und dem dionysischen Aspekt sehr beeindruckte. Sie erlebte auch das amerikanische Kino der 1950er Jahre und verehrte ganz besonders die Schauspielerin Ava Gardner. 1959 erwarb die Familie einen Fernseher. Dadurch lernte Camille Paglia Kinofilme der 1930er Jahre kennen, insbesondere mit Katharine Hepburn, die einen starken Eindruck auf sie machte. Ganz besonders beeindruckt, ja geradezu verliebt war sie in Elizabeth Taylor.

Während ihrer Schulzeit musste die Familie Paglia, bedingt durch die Karriere ihres Vaters als akademischer Lehrer, zweimal umziehen. Ihre Schulzeit an der ''Primary School'' und an der ''High School'' verbrachte sie in Oxford, New York und in der Universitätsstadt Syracuse, New York. Sie stand in dem Ruf, ein sehr ehrgeiziges, aber auch aggressives Kind zu sein. An der Highschool war sie eine exzellente, hingebungsvolle Schülerin. Ihre Lateinlehrerin Carmelia Metosh schildert sie als alert und präsent – und stets zur Kontroverse aufgelegt: ''Egal was im Unterricht behauptet wurde, sie musste den Gegenstandpunkt vertreten. Und die brachte dabei gute Argumente vor, genau wie heute'', sagte Carmelia Metosh 1992 über sie.

Drei Jahre an der High School widmete sie intensiven Studien über Amelia Earhart und verbrachte praktisch jeden Samstag in der öffentlichen Bibliothek, um alte Zeitschriften und Zeitungen zu durchwühlen. ''Vor der Zeit des Mikrofilms. Alles zerfiel in Fetzen. Wahrscheinlich habe ich die ganze Sammlung ruiniert.''

Mehrere Sommerferien als Teenager verbrachte Camille Paglia in einem Pfadfindercamp für Mädchen. Viele Jahre später nannte sie diese Feriencamps in einem Artikel im ''New York Observer'' einen ''prä-lesbischen Himmel. Es war so romantisch. Voller verrückter Erschütterungen für alle Betreuerinnen.'' Sie gab sich dort verschiedene Namen, insbesondere von Heldinnen aus Filmrollen, und sprengte eines Tages die Latrine in die Luft, indem sie zu viel Kalk hinein schüttete. Für sie hatte dieser Vorgang eine grundlegende Bedeutung: ''Er verkörperte alles, was ich mit meinem Leben und meiner Arbeit tun wollte. Exzesse und Extravaganz und Explosivität. Ich würde jemand sein, der in die Latrine der Kultur schaut.''

In gewisser Weise war ihr Geburtstag im Jahr 1963 der Beginn ihrer Karriere. Zu diesem Anlass schenkte eine belgische Kollegin ihres Vaters, Josephina van Hal McGinn, das Buch Das andere Geschlecht von Simone de Beauvoir. Dieses Buch hatte einen enormen Einfluss auf sie und förderte ihren Entschluss, eine feministische Autorin zu werden. Am 8. Juli 1963 veröffentlichte Newsweek ihren Leserbrief über gleiche Chancen für amerikanische Frauen. Und am 24. November erschien in der Syracuser Zeitung ''Herald American'' ein kurzer Artikel über sie und ihre herausragenden Leistungen.

=== College und Universität ===

1964 bestand sie ihren Highschoolabschluss und schrieb sich am ''Harpur College'' in Binghamton ein. Sie freundete sich mit Bruce Benderson, Stephen Jarratt und Stephen Feld an, drei schwule Männer, die noch großen Einfluss auf sie ausüben sollten. Während eines Feriensommers arbeitete sie in der Nachtschicht in einem Krankenhaus als Sekretärin in der Notaufnahme.

Ein Semester lang setzte das College sie auf Bewährung, weil ihr 39 Streiche vorgeworfen wurden. Im Alter von 19 Jahren schlug sie einem betrunkenen jungen Mann, der gemeinsam mit einem Freund eine Frau auf der Straße aggressiv begrapschte, mit der Faust in die Zähne.

Im selben Jahr erschien Andy Warhols Film ''Chelsea Girls''. Camille Paglia sah diesen Film und war besonders angetan von der Schauspielerin Mary Woronov. ''Sie war eine der originellsten, stilvollsten und redegewandtesten sexuellen Rollen'' (Personae) ''im königlichen Haus Warhol. Ich vergaß sie nie und verfolgte ihre weitere Filmkarriere mit großer Faszination.'' Viele ihrer Erinnerungen an die 1960er Jahre sind mit Filmen verbunden, die sie gemeinsam mit ihrem Freund Stephen Jarratt sah.

Auf dem College hatte sie großes Interesse an Geologie und naturkundlichen Themen, fühlte sich aber letztendlich stärker zu Kunst und Kultur hingezogen. Sie bestand ihren Collegeabschluss Yale Graduate School ein.

Im selben Sommer begegnete sie in New York auf der Straße Catherine Deneuve und ertappte sich dabei, wie sie ihr während ihrer Einkäufe im vornehmen Kaufhaus Saks Fifth Avenue hinterher schlich. 

Einige Monate später, bei einer Party bei einem ihrer Hochschullehrer, wurde sie von dem prominenten Psychiatrie-Hochschullehrer ''Robert Lifton'' und dessen Frau beschimpft, lesbisch zu sein. Sein Angriff ermutigte sie, nicht nur allgemein als Lesbe bekannt zu sein, sondern sich auch dazu zu bekennen. Zwischen 1968 und 1972 war sie die einzige sich offen bekennende Lesbe in Yale. Dies wirkte sich zunächst negativ auf ihre Karriere aus.

Während ihrer Studienzeit in Yale stritt Camille Paglia mit Rita Mae Brown, die sie später als ''zu jener Zeit nihilistisch dunkel'' charakterisierte, und mit der ''Women's Liberation Rock Band'', weil letztere die Rolling Stones als sexistisch abqualifizierten.

Ihre Studien zur Sexualität in der westlichen Literatur setzte sie mit der Lektüre von D. H. Lawrences ''Women in Love'' and Edmund Spensers ''The Faerie Queene'' (''Die Elfenkönigin'') fort. Zu letzterem Werk findet sich eine ausführliche Analyse in ihrem Buch ''Sexual Personae''. Sie traf sich zweimal mit Kate Millett, nachdem letztere gerade berühmt geworden war, fand aber, dass letztere ''zu griesgrämig egozentrisch war, um klar zu sehen''. Weil Camille Paglia enttäuscht war von der ihrer Meinung nach nachlässigen Haltung Kate Millets als Lehrerin, entwickelte sie eine Abneigung gegen sie.

1971 entdeckte sie Kenneth Clarks Buch ''The Nude'' (''Der Akt''). ''Wenn ich jemals ein Buch liebte, dann dieses'', schrieb sie in ihrem Buch ''Sex, Art & American Culture'', und in einem Artikel für die Zeitschrift ''Women's Quarterly'' nannte sie es 2002 ''bei weitem die beste Einführung in die Darstellung der menschlichen Gestalt in der Kunst.'' Das Buch beeinflusste ihre Dissertation in Yale und ihre gesamte weitere Arbeit.

1971 erwarb sie den Master-Titel der Philosophie in Yale.

=== Karriere als Hochschullehrerin ===

Im Herbst 1972 trat sie ihre erste Lehrstelle am ''Bennington College'' an. Einer ihrer Studenten, Mark W. Edmundson, der inzwischen Professor an der University of Virginia ist, erinnert sich an sie: ''Sie war mir als Fakultätsbetreuerin in ihrem ersten Lehrjahr zugeteilt worden. Ich kam zum Beratungsgespräch und sie war ganz sie selbst. Sie sprach sehr rasch über eine Menge Sachen, von denen ich nichts wusste. Verängstigt lief ich heraus. Leider war ich zu verwirrt, um einen ihrer Kurse zu belegen, in denen lauter sehr schlaue Leute aus LA und New York zu stecken schienen.''

Lord Hervey and Pope'' in der Zeitschrift ''18th century Studies''. Die Literaturbeilage der Times pries diese Arbeit am 2. November 1973 als ''brillant''.

Am 9. April 1973 reiste sie nach Dartmouth, um Susan Sontag bei einer Vorlesung zu hören, und lud sie später nach Bennington ein. Susan Sontag las dort am 4. Oktober eine Kurzgeschichte – und löste damit einen Eklat aus, weil sie ursprünglich zugesagt hatte, eine Vorlesung über Kultur zu halten. In den Augen der enttäuschten Camille Paglia hatte Susan Sontag damit ihren Ruf als große Intellektuelle verspielt. Sie schrieb einen boshaften Essay über das Treffen, der in ihrem Buch ''Vamps & Tramps'' erschien.

Eine weitere intellektuelle Enttäuschung für Camille Paglia war Marija Gimbutas, die Autorin des 1974 erschienenen Buchs ''The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe''. Anlässlich einer Ausstellung von ihr in Bennington veröffentlichte Camille Paglia eine Polemik, die im Vorwurf gipfelte, Marija Gimbutas verwende unerträglich schludriges feministisches Material, das die Existenz eines friedlichen prähistorischen Matriarchats unterstellt, das absichtlich von garstigen Männern gestürzt werde.

Durch ihre Studien der Klassiker und von Werken von Erich Neumann entwickelte Camille Paglia ihre Theorie der Sexualhistorie, die im Widerspruch zu den Ideen stand, die zu jener Zeit en vogue waren. Das war der tiefere Grund für ihre Opposition gegen Kate Millett, Marija Gimbutas, Carolyn Heilbrun und andere führende Feministinnen jener Zeit.

Ihre Ideen legte sie in ihrer Dissertation ''Sexual Personae: The Androgyne in Literature and Art'' (''Masken der Sexualität: Das Androgyne in Literatur und Kunst'') im Dezember 1974, im Alter von 27 Jahren, vor. Für Ihre Dissertation erhielt sie den Titel einer ''Ph.D.'' (Doktorin der Philosophie) der Yale Universität.
