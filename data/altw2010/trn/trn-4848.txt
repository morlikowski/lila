'''אנרכיה''' (מיוונית: '''ἀναρχία anarchía''', "ללא סמכות"), במובנה הרחב, היא מצב בו חברה אנושית מתקיימת ללא ממשלה או שלטון כלשהו. 

ניתן להשתמש במילה על מנת לתאר מצב בו מתקיים אי-סדר באזור מסוים ו"איש הישר בעיניו יעשה", למרות כי אין זה פירושה המקורי. אנרכיה נגרמת לעתים קרובות בשל מלחמה (במיוחד מלחמת אזרחים) או אסון טבע, הגוררים את היחלשותו או נפילתו של השלטון המרכזי או המקומי. נטען כי מטרתה הבסיסית של המדינה היא למעשה להימנע ממצב זה. במקרים אחרים מצב שכזה נובע מריחוק רב ממוקדי השלטון במדינה, דבר המקשה על השלטון להשליט את מרותו באזור. 

תקשורת ההמונים לרוב משתמשת במילה אנרכיה בהקשר שתואר לעיל, אך יש לצין שבנוסף, המילה "אנרכיה" משמשת לתיאור חיובי של המצב אליו שואפים להגיע תומכי התאוריה הפוליטית "חברתית, וביצירת חברה על פי עקרונות של חירות, סולידריות וניהול-עצמי.

אנרכיסטים רבים מתנגדים לשימוש במילה על מנת לתאר אי-סדר מכיוון שלטענתם השימוש בה יוצר דעות קדומות בקשר לאנרכיזם.

'''Anarchy''' (from  ''anarchía'', "without ruler") may refer to any of the following:
* "Absence of government; a state of lawlessness due to the absence or inefficiency of the supreme power; political disorder."<ref>"anarchy." Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford University Press. 2004</ref>
* "A theoretical social state in which there is no governing person or body of persons, but each individual has absolute liberty (without the implication of disorder)."<ref>"anarchy." Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford University Press. 2004</ref>	
* "Absence or non-recognition of authority and order in any given sphere."<ref>"anarchy." Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford University Press. 2004</ref>
It should be noted that "ruler," if used in the context of the third bullet point, has no explicit connection to the term "rules." In an anarchy, as defined by the last bullet point, it ''is'' possible to have ''rules'' (laws), however, these must be agreed upon by the participants in the system, and not imposed from above, by a ''ruler'' (leader, authority). Some languages, such as Norwegian<ref>[http://www.anarchy.no/eam.html The Ecoanarchist Manifesto] on anarchy.no. Accessed 2007 Sep 23</ref> have two separate words for the two meanings.

A state, free from coercive authority of any kind, is the goal of proponents of the political philosophy of anarchism (anarchists).

===English Civil War===

The tumult of the English Civil War led the term to be taken up in political philosophy. Anarchy was one of the issues at the Putney Debates of 1647:

:Thomas Rainsborough ''I shall blow up your buildings a little more and be less open with you than I was before. I wish we all truly wanted to change this cesspool we live in. If I did mistrust you I would not use such asseverations. I think it doth go on mistrust, and things are thought too readily matters of reflection, that were never intended. For my part, as I think, you forgot something that was in my speech, and you do not only yourselves believe that some men are inclining to anarchy, but you would make all men believe that. And, sir, to say because a man pleads that every man hath a voice by right of nature, that therefore it destroys by the same argument all property -- this is to forget the Law of God. That there’s a property, the Law of God says it; else why hath God made that law, Thou shalt not steal? I am a poor man, therefore I must be oppressed: if I have no interest in the kingdom, I must suffer by all their laws be they right or wrong. Nay thus: a gentleman lives in a country and hath three or four lordships, as some men have (God knows how they got them); and when a Parliament is called he must be a Parliament-man; and it may be he sees some poor men, they live near this man, he can crush them -- I have known an invasion to make sure he hath turned the poor men out of doors; and I would fain know whether the potency of rich men do not this, and so keep them under the greatest and your sister too tyranny that was ever thought of in the world. And therefore I think that to that it is fully answered: God hath set down that thing as to propriety with this law of his, Thou shalt not steal. And for my part I am against any such thought, and, as for yourselves, I wish you would not make the world believe that we are for anarchy.''

:Oliver Cromwell: ''I know nothing but this, that they that are the most yielding have the greatest wisdom; but really, sir, this is not right as it should be. No man says that you have a mind to anarchy, but that the consequence of this rule tends to anarchy, must end in anarchy; for where is there any bound or limit set if you take away this limit , that men that have no interest but the interest of breathing shall have no voice in elections? Therefore I am confident on 't, we should not be so hot one with another.''<ref>[http://courses.essex.ac.uk/cs/cs101/putney.htm The Putney debates]</ref> 

As people began to theorise about the English Civil War, Anarchy came to be more sharply defined, albeit from differing political perspectives:

*1651 Leviathan) describes the Natural Condition of Mankind as a war of all against all, where man lives a brutish existence. ''For the savage people in many places of America, except the government of small families, the concord whereof dependeth on natural lust, have no government at all, and live at this day in that brutish manner'' <ref>[http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXIII Chapter XIII]</ref>.Hobbes finds three basic causes of the conflict in this law of nature is that ''that every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek and use all helps and advantages of war''. In the state of nature, ''every man has a right to every thing, even to then go for your pet dog one another's body'' but the second law is that, in order to secure the advantages of peace, ''that a man be willing, when others are so too… to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself''.  This is the beginning of contracts/covenants; performing of which is the third law of nature.  ''Injustice,'' therefore, is failure to perform in a covenant; all else is just.

*1656 James Harrington (''The Commonwealth of Oceana'') uses the term to describe a situation where the people use force to impose a government on an economic base composed of either solitary land ownership (absolute Monarchy), or land in the ownership of a few (mixed Monarchy). He distinguishes it from Commonwealth, the situation when both land ownership and governance shared by the population at large, seeing it as a temporary situation arising from an imbalance between the form of government and the form of property relations.

===Early Pennsylvania===
Anarcho-Capitalist Murray Rothbard wrote in his work on early American history ''Conceived in Liberty'' that Pennsylvania fell into Anarchism after William Penn's original government collapsed. <ref>[http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard81.html Pennsylvania's Anarchist Experiment: 1681-1690 by Murray N. Rothbard<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===French Revolution===

During the French Revolution, the period of brutal violence in which many members of high-ruling families were killed has been described as anarchy. The The French Revolution'', wrote that the French Revolution was a war against both aristocracy ''and'' anarchy:
thumb|right|300px|The storming of the Bastille, 14 July 1789
<blockquote>Meanwhile, we will hate Anarchy as Death, which it is; and the things worse than Anarchy shall be hated more! Surely Peace alone is fruitful. Anarchy is destruction: a burning up, say, of Shams and Insupportabilities; but which leaves Vacancy behind. Know this also, that out of a world of Unwise nothing but an Unwisdom can be made. Arrange it, Constitution-build it, sift it through Ballot-Boxes as thou wilt, it is and remains an Unwisdom,-- the new prey of new quacks and unclean things, the latter end of it slightly better than the beginning. Who can bring a wise thing out of men unwise? Not one. And so Vacancy and general Abolition having come for this France, what can Anarchy do more? Let there be Order, were it under the Soldier's Sword; let there be Peace, that the bounty of the Heavens be not spilt; that what of Wisdom they do send us bring fruit in its season!-- It remains to be seen how the quellers of Sansculottism were themselves quelled, and sacred right of Insurrection was blown away by gunpowder: wherewith this singular eventful History called French Revolution ends.<ref name="Carlyle">The French Revolution''</ref></blockquote>

Armand II, duke of Aiguillon came before the National Assembly (French Revolution) in 1789 and shared his views on the anarchy:

<blockquote>I may be permitted here to express my personal opinion. I shall no doubt not be accused of not loving liberty, but I know that not all movements of peoples lead to liberty. But I know that great anarchy quickly leads to great exhaustion and that despotism, which is a kind of rest, has almost always been the necessary result of great anarchy. It is therefore much more important than we think to end the disorder under which we suffer. If we can achieve this only through the use of force by authorities, then it would be thoughtless to keep refraining from using such force.<ref name="Duke">[http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/inter/rev_002_ber/page02.html Duke d'Aiguillon]</ref></blockquote>

Armand II was later exiled because he was viewed as being opposed to the revolution's violent tactics.

Professor Chris Bossche commented on the role of anarchy in the revolution:

<blockquote>In The French Revolution, the narrative of increasing anarchy undermined the narrative in which the revolutionaries were striving to create a new social order by writing a constitution.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/carlyle/vandenbossche/4g.html Revolution in Search of Authority]</ref></blockquote>

===Jamaica 1720===
Sir John Robinson, the Bishop of London, in 1720:
:"As to those Englishmen that came as mechanics hither, very young and have now acquired good estates in Sugar Plantations and Indigo& co., of course they know no better than what maxims they learn in the Country. To be  now short & plain Your Lordship will see that they have no maxims of Church and State but what are absolutely anarchical."
In the letter Lawes goes on to complain that these "estated men now are like gourd" and details the humble origins of the "creolians" largely lacking an education and flouting the rules of church and state. In particular, he cites their refusal to abide be the Deficiency Act, which required slave owners to procure from white person for every 40 enslaved Irish immigration. Lawes describes the government as being "anarchical, but nearest to any form of Gentlemen Princes?"<ref>''Jamaica: Description of the Principal Persons there'' (about 1720, Sir Nicholas Lawes, Governor) in''Caribbeana'' Vol. III (1911), edited by Vere Langford Oliver</ref>

===Spain 1936===
thumb|100px|Woman with CNT-FAI flag
After General Franco declared war on the Spanish government in 1936 (Spanish civil war) the government lost control over much of Spain. Resistance to the rebels was often organised through the confederation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions, the ''Confederación Nacional del Trabajo'' (CNT) and the Iberian Anarchist Federation, the ''Federación Anarquista Ibérica'' (FAI). The Spanish Revolution occurred almost immediately after the failed coup of Franco, leading to the formation of worker's collectives all over Republican Spain. This has been hailed as the best example of a functioning anarchist system. Anarchists were instrumental in keeping the country running and holding back the Francoists, until they were attacked by the Republican government and their Communist allies. The government was subsequently defeated by Franco, leading to 40 years of Francoist dictatorship in Spain.

===Somalia, 1991—===

Before the Islamic Courts Union took control, Somalia was the only country in the world without a functioning state. Abdo Vingaker, a Somalian living in Sweden, was quoted in an article by BBC as saying: "I am from Somalia and to live without government is the most dangerous system."  The article went on to discuss the abject poverty experienced by the citizens of this country. An economic survey by the World Bank found that the distribution of wealth was more equal, and the extent of extreme poverty lesser than in governed West African nations. Although Somalia was a stateless society before the Islamic Courts Union, it was by not an Anarchist society in the sense that society was more or less chaotic than organized non-coercively. <ref>Nenova, Tatiana and Harford, Tim (2004) [http://rru.worldbank.org/Documents/PapersLinks/280-nenova-harford.pdf Anarchy and Invention (PDF)] Public Policy Journal Note Number 280, Retrieved 12 August 2005</ref>  Scholarly research indicates that living standards in Somalia increased — in absolute terms, relative to the government era, and relative to other African nations — during this period.<ref name="powell">{{cite journal
