'''Political parties in Iran''' gives information on the political parties in Iran. 

Iran has regular presidential and parliamentary elections. Only those candidates and parties that are approved by the clerical Islamist ideology.

Currently, there are 223 <ref>[http://www.moi.ir/Portal/File/ShowFile.aspx?ID=729faeac-9ff4-48e3-95ec-7fa595415029 List of the parties]</ref> registered political parties, associations and organizations that have been given legitimacy to operate, but not as an opposition to the religious system of the governance.  They usually operate in loose alignments within two main coalitions, the conservative and the reformist.

There is also the Kurdish United Front.

==Opposition parties active in exile==
===Generality===
=====Ideologies=====
There are roughly 70 political parties outside Iran (they fled the Islamist Regime) which can be divided into 6 ideological branches from left to right :

- the Communists (17 parties)

- the Socialists and Social-Democrats (8 parties)

- the Ethnicalists (24 parties)

- the Nationalists (6 parties)

- the Liberal-Democrats (9 parties)

- the Conservatives (4 parties)

=====Notoriety of these parties=====
In fact a lot of Iranians do not know the majority of these 70 exiled political parties. The parties known by nearly all Iranians are the Mojahedin, the Monarchists (falsely believed to be one party), the National Front (known in Iran as the Mossadeghists), the Fadayan-e Khalq and the Tudeh Party (today an agonizing party but falsely believed by many to be the only Communist Party). For example, few Iranians are aware of the existence of the Hekmatist Party although the latter is more dynamic than the Tudeh. Only 4 parties out of the 70 could be considered powerful, in order : 

- the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran of Maryam Rajavi, (Conservative)

- the Constitutionalist Party of Iran of Daryoush Homayoun, (Liberal-Democrat)

- the Organization of Iranian People's Fedaian (Majority) of Behrouz Khaliq (Socialist)

- the National Front of Iran of Adib Boroumand, (Center-Left Nationalist)

''see also List of political parties in Iran.'' 

The rest of the Opposition is insignificant : for example the "Labor Party" or the "Green Party" or the "Rastakhiz Organization" are rather tiny clubs of individuals than political parties and do not influence the political arena of Iran. But 11 of them are of some importance :

- The '''Tudeh Party''' and the '''Communist Party of Iran''' (of Ebrahim Alizadeh), which were important parties in the past, exist today in a very anemic state.

- The Worker-Communist Party of Iran was formerly powerful and led by the charismatic Mansoor Hekmat before splitting into three weak parties [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Iran#Hekmatism] when the latter died in 2002. Among the three parties '''the Hekmatist Party''' is the most vocal.

- The '''Pan-Iranist Party''' and the '''Iran Nation Party''', both based in Iran, have always been dynamic but very small parties. The Iran Nation Party has suffered a great loss when both of its leaders, Dariush and Parvaneh Forouhar, were murdered in Tehran in 1998 by the Islamic Republic.

- The '''National Movement of Iranian Resistance''' (NAMIR) of Shahpour Bakhtiar [http://www.cyrusnews.com/audio/1985%20IRTV.wmv] and the '''Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan''' (DPIK) of Abdul Rahman Qasimlo, although prominent parties in the past, have almost been destroyed with the killings of their charismatic leaders by the Islamic Republic. The NAMIR has almost ceased to exist, whereas the DPIK struggles to expand its activities. In December 2006, this party split another time into two groups : the DPIK and the DPIK (Ararat).

- The '''Organization of Revolutionary Workers of Iran (Rahe Kargar)''' has isolated itself by rejecting joint actions or even dialogue with non-communist parties (they do not have a good relation even with some communist parties deemed not too radical like the Tudeh Party). The Rahe Kargar is seen by many right and left parties as a sectarian and inflexible party. [http://www.etehadefedaian.org/?page=article&nid=1296]

- The '''Komala''' (not to be confused with the Komalah with an h), although an important party, can't be classified among the four powerful party of the Opposition cited above since its modest activities are only concentrated in the kurdish-inhabited provinces of Iran. Furthermore Komala split into two parties in August 2007[http://www.komala.org/farsi/aqlit/071004_BahmanAlyar.htm].

- The '''Marze Por Gohar''' Party is still too small, too localized and unknown inside Iran.

- The '''Islamic Society of the Iranians''' has few members but has a prominent leader (Abolhassan Banisadr).

- The '''Union of People's Fedaian of Iran''' is the Iranian Party with the most ties with other Opposition parties (it has warm relations even with the Rahe Kargar). It has been designated as the twin sister of the Organization of Iranian People's Fedaian-Majority but has far fewer members.

=====Important individuals without party=====
There are important exiled individuals with no party who are also important : Ali Afshari, Amir-Abbas Fakhravar, Hassan Zarezadeh Ardeshir, Ahmad Batebi or Manuchehr Mohammadi from the student segment, Mohsen Sazegara, a founder of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Ramin Jahanbegloo, Abdolkarim Soroush or Dariush Shayegan, influential secular and religious intellectuals, Roya Toloui, a woman activist, Akbar Ganji, the well-known political activist and journalist, Abbas Amir-Entezam, the longest political prisoner of Iran (27 years), Simin Behbahani, one of the most prominent figures in modern Persian literature, Nasser Zarafshan, a famous attorney, Abolhassan Banisadr, the first president of Iran, etc… Even among the clerics based inside and outside Iran, there are numerous radical dissidents but some are more prominent, for example : Hossein Khomeini, grandson of the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi, Ayatollah Ganjei (exiled in Paris), Ayatollah Mehdi Haeri Khorshidi (exiled in Germany) or Hojjatoleslam Ezimi Qedimi, etc. Several mullah dissidents around the world created "the Free Muslims" : [http://www.freemuslim.org/sohof/drood/main.htm].

==='''History''' ===
=====Past (1990-2003)=====
Before the year 2003, a lot of parties tried to unite and failed. Only two unions succeeded; but even them - which are the National Council of Resistance of Iran and the Workers Left Unity - Iran - are just an alliance of two parties : the conservative People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran and the marxist Organization of Iranian People Fadaee Guerillas for the first one and the Iranian fedaian communist league and the Organization of Revolutionary Workers of Iran (Rahe Kargar) for the latter.

Some Communists (the Tudeh Party for example), the Socialists (above all Organization of Iranian People's Fedaian-Majority), the Nationalists (for instance the National Front), the Monarchists (as the Constitutionalist Party) and the Ethnicalists (like the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan) several times discussed how to come together in the past, but without results, given that :
