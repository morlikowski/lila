'''''Spam''''' är en känd sketch i spam. Enligt en hypotes har sketchen gett upphov till att ordet ''spam'' används för oönskad e-post (se skräppost).

==Roller==
I sketchen deltar
*Terry Jones som servitris,
*Eric Idle som mr Bun och
*Graham Chapman som mrs Bun.

I den tv-sända sketchen är också John Cleese med som ''ungraren'' men han är inte med i ljudinspelningen av sketchen.

==Sketchen==

Sketchen är tre och en halv minut lång och utspelar sig på ''The Green Midget Café'' i Bromley och består av en diskussion mellan servitrisen, som har en meny där i stort sett alla rätter innehåller ''spam'' och mrs Bun, som önskar beställa något som inte innehåller ''spam''.

Vid flera tillfällen avbryter en grupp vikingar konversationen genom att högt sjunga "''Spam, lovely Spam, wonderful Spam''". De avbryts av servitrisen flera gånger men återupptar sjungandet och sjunger högre och högre varje gång.

Sketchen hade premiär den 15 december 1970 som den sista sketchen i den 25:e delen av ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' och i eftertexterna hade namnen på alla medverkande bytts ut så att deras namn antingen innehöll ''spam'' eller något annat ord från menyn. Ordet ''spam'' nämns minst 132 gånger i sketchen. Sketchen har också varit med i flera av Monty Pythons videor.

'''"Spam"''' is a popular sketch, first televised in processed meat product in almost every dish. The term ''spam'' (in electronic communication, and as of 2008, general slang) is derived from this sketch.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spam spam - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

It features Hungarian and Michael Palin as a historian, but this part was left out of audio recordings of the sketch.

== Sketch ==
Only three and a half minutes long, it builds up into a semi-argument between the waitress who has a menu limited to having Spam in just about everything ("Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, baked beans, Spam, Spam, Spam and Spam"), and Mrs Bun, who is the only one in the room who does not want it. She asks for an item with the Spam removed (despite there already being some items mentioned that do not actually include Spam), much to the amazement of her Spam-loving husband. Eventually, Mrs Bun resorts to screaming, "I don't like Spam!"

At several points, a group of Vikings in the restaurant (referred to as the Green Midget Café in Bromley) interrupt conversation by loudly singing "Spam, lovely Spam, wonderful Spam." They are interrupted by the waitress several times, but they resume singing more and more loudly until the sketch cuts to an historian talking about the Vikings, "...and Spam selecting a Spam particular Spam item from the Spam menu, would Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam..." as the singing continues on and on...

It premiered on Spam Terry Jones, Michael Spam Palin, John Spam John Spam John Spam Cleese, Graham Spam Spam Spam Chapman, Eric Spam Egg and Chips Idle, Terry Spam Sausage Spam Egg Spam Gilliam, etc.) The sketch became immensely popular. The word ''Spam'' is uttered at least 132 times.

This sketch has also been featured in several Monty Python videos including ''Parrot Sketch Not Included - 20 Years of Monty Python''.

The DVD release of the sketch contains a deliberate subtitling error. When the Hungarian tries to order food, his words are "My lower intestine is full of Spam, Egg, Spam, Bacon, Spam, Tomatoes, Spam." Yet the subtitles read "Your intestine is full of ''Sperm''."  This is a continuation of the "Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook" sketch, earlier in the episode. The subtitles are a continuation to an argument some Python fans have waged over whether the Hungarian is saying "Spam" (which would be logical) or "Sperm" (which is what it sounds like, and would tie in better with the Hungarian phrasebook's wording).

The audio version of the sketch, since the Hungarian and historian are not featured, instead has the Vikings reaching an operatic climax.

Spam was one of the few meats excluded from the British food rationing that began in World War II and continued for a number of years after the war, and the British grew heartily tired of it, hence the sketch.
