The '''Ryder Cup''' is a PGA of America and the PGA European Tour.

The competition began following an exhibition match in British PGA on the East Course, Wentworth Club, Virginia Water, Surrey, UK, with the first competition taking place in 1927. 

Early matches between the two sides were fairly even, but after the Fred Daly from Northern Ireland first played in 1947.</ref> team to Europe in 1979.  This change was partly prompted by the success of a new generation of Spanish golfers of the time including Severiano Ballesteros. He and Antonio Garrido were the first Spaniards to play in the event in 1979. Europe has also been represented since then by players from Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden.

As a result of this change the event has enjoyed more competitive matches, with Europe winning seven times and retaining the cup once, compared to six American wins.

The Ryder Cup Matches involve various match play matches between players selected from two teams of twelve. Currently, the matches consist of eight foursomes matches, eight fourball matches and twelve singles matches. The winner of each match scores a point for their team, with ½ a point each for any match that is tied after 18 holes.

A foursomes match is a competition between two teams of two golfers. The golfers on the same team take alternate shots throughout the match, with the same ball. Each hole is won by the team that completes the hole in the fewest shots. A fourball match is also a competition between two teams of two golfers, but all four golfers play their own ball throughout the round rather than alternating shots, and each hole is won by the team whose individual golfer has the lowest score. A singles match is a standard matchplay competition between two golfers.

The matches take place over three days, Friday through Sunday. On the Friday, there are four fourball matches and four foursomes matches in the afternoon. On the Saturday, the same schedule repeats. On the Sunday, there are twelve singles matches. Not all players need play on Friday and Saturday; the captain can select any eight players for each of the four rounds of play over these two days.

The format has changed over the years.  From the inaugural event through 1959 the Ryder Cup was a two-day competition, with four 36-hole foursomes matches on the first day and eight 36-hole singles matches on the second day, for a total of 12 points.  In 1961 the matches were changed to 18 holes each but the number of matches was doubled, resulting in a total of 24 points.  In 1963 the event was expanded to three days, with eight fourball matches being added on the middle day to make 32 points.  This format remained until 1977, when the number of matches was reduced to 20: five foursomes matches on the first day, five fourball matches on the second day, and ten singles matches on the final day.  In 1979, the first year continental European players participated, the format was changed to the 28-match version in use today.<ref></ref>

In 2008 the format for the event will not stay the same as in the previous two Ryder Cup Matches. For the first time since 1999, the opening matches of a Ryder Cup will feature the alternate-shot format. United States captain Paul Azinger, hoping to give his team an early advantage in Kentucky, announced the change on January 30 at the PGA Tour's FBR Open in Phoenix. 

Alternate shot, or foursomes, had been used in the first sessions every year since 1981 until European captain Seve Ballesteros opened with better ball (fourballs) in 1997 at Valderrama. U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw switched back to alternate shot in 1999 at Brookline, but the last three Ryder Cup matches have started with better ball.<ref>{{cite news

== Team Selections ==
=== European ===
There are two qualifying sections used for the European selection: The European Tour list and the world ranking points list.

=== USA ===
The way in which the United States team will be selected has been revamped for the 2008 competition.

Qualification for the United States team began with the four major championships contested in 2007, and will continue from January 1, 2008 until August 11, 2008. The top eight players will automatically qualify for the 2008 United States Ryder Cup Team, with the remaining four places reserved for Captain’s picks. The Captain will make those picks on September 2, 2008.

The selection process will be determined by the following criteria:<ref>[http://www.europeantour.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7B74BF845F-76E3-40F9-9C3E-5388E85B167B%7D&rydercupid=2008 PGA European Tour - US Ryder Cup Points<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Founding of the Cup ==
There is some debate over who suggested the idea for the Ryder Cup. James Harnett, a journalist with USPGA on December 15, 1920 and, having failed to attract support, the idea was refloated by Sylvanus P. "SP" Jermain, president of the Inverness Club, the next year. This resulted in an unofficial match in 1921, won 9–3 by the British, and another in 1926, won 13½–1½ by Britain.  Present at the second 1926 match, held on the East Course at Wentworth Club, Virginia Water, Surrey, was Samuel Ryder, a seed merchant who traded from St Albans, Hertfordshire. Having watched the play, Mr Ryder thought it would be good idea to make the match official and thus the Ryder Cup was founded, with Ryder donating the trophy.<ref>The figure of the golfer on top of the gold trophy is purported to be Abe Mitchell, the professional who taught Samuel Ryder how to play the game.</ref>

Few people who took up golf after their 50th birthday have left as many positive impressions on the game during the history of golf. To get started Ryder recruited the services of a golf professional called Hill from a local golf course to introduce him to the fundamentals of golf. Afterwards Ryder hired Abe Mitchell as his private tutor for a fee of £1,000 per year. Ryder received most of his lessons at his home, Marlborough House, and he was relentless. He practised his driving, pitching and putting six days each week.

At the age of 51 he had achieved a handicap of six and was accepted as a member of the Verulam Golf Club in St Albans in 1910. A year later he became captain of the golf club. He was also club captain in 1926 and 1927. In 1923 he sponsored the Heath and Heather Tournament which was only open to professionals. One of the golf professionals that took part was ex-gardener Abe Mitchell, considered  one of best British golfers of his era.

Among the British, at the 1926 landmark match, were golfing giants George Duncan, Ted Ray (portrayed by Stephen Marcus in the 2005 film ''The Greatest Game Ever Played''), and Arthur Havers. From  America came Walter Hagen, Tommy Armour, Jim Barnes and Al Watrous. 

This first official match was held in Worcester, Massachusetts, at the Worcester Country Club, in 1927. Ryder, who donated a gold cup and had agreed to pay £5 to each member of the winning team, attached his name to the new competition. It has been held on a two year cycle since, apart from 1939 to 1945 when it was cancelled due to World War II. 

The 2001 match was delayed for a year, as it was due to take place very shortly after the September 11 attacks. It was subsequently decided to hold the Ryder Cup in even-numbered years instead of odd-numbered years. The boards at The Brabazon Course at The Belfry, which hosted the 2002 Ryder Cup (which should have been hosted in 2001) still read '''The 2001 Ryder Cup''' and USA captain Curtis Strange deliberately referred to the US team as "The 2001 Ryder Cup Team" in his speech at the closing ceremony.

Europe claimed their first hat-trick of victories in 2002, 2004 and 2006: this was particularly surprising as no European player won a single Major in that time period (Americans won fifteen).

== Controversial Ryder Cups ==
===1969===
The 1969 Cup held at Royal Birkdale was perhaps one of the best and most competitive contests in terms of play (18 of the 32 matches went to the last green), but it was also marred by acrimony and gamesmanship between some players. In one of golf's most memorable moments of sportsmanship, Jack Nicklaus, playing in his first Ryder Cup Matches, conceded a two-footer to Tony Jacklin after making a four-footer for par on the last green. The 'gimme' was very generous; Jacklin was far from assured of making it. Nicklaus said: 'I don't think you would have missed that putt, but in these circumstances, I would never give you the opportunity.' The result was the first tie in the Matches' history (the US retained the Cup) but some of Nicklaus' teammates including captain Sam Snead were less than pleased.

===1991===
After accusing each other of cheating at The Belfry in 1989, the feud between Seve Ballesteros and Paul Azinger escalated at the Kiawah Island Golf Resort in 1991. Azinger: 'I can tell you we're not trying to cheat.' Ballesteros: 'Oh no. Breaking the rules and cheating are two different things.' The constant goading intensified their desire to win and with their partners, José María Olazábal and Chip Beck respectively, they produced what is regarded as the best pairs match in history, the Spaniards winning 2&1.

===1999===

The 1999 Ryder Cup held at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., caused great controversy.  A remarkable comeback by the American team helped propel the U.S. to a 14.5-13.5 victory after trailing 10-6 heading into the final day. The U.S. went 8-3-1 in singles matches to seal the first American victory since 1993.

'''Ryder Cup''' on joka toinen vuosi järjestettävä Euroopan ja Yhdysvaltain parhaat golfammattilaiset. Kilpailun järjestävät PGA of America ja PGA European Tour. Naisten vastaava kilpailu on Solheim Cup.

==Historiaa==
Vuonna Ison-Britannian joukkueiden välillä. Tuon ottelun innoittamana ensimmäinen Ryder Cup järjestettiin seuraavana vuonna. Vuosina 1935–1973 britit saavuttivat vain yhden voiton, ja vuonna 1973 turnaus pelattiin ensi kertaa Yhdysvaltain sekä Ison-Britannian ja Irlannin pelaajista koostuneiden joukkueiden välillä. Nykyinen tapa, jossa kilpailevat Yhdysvaltain ja Euroopan joukkueet, otettiin käyttöön vuonna 1979.

^2001 ottelua lykättiin vuodella syyskuun 11. päivän iskujen vuoksi. 

Vuosina 1969 ja 1989 tuloksena oli tasapeli, jolloin pokaali jäi edellisen turnauksen voittajalle.
