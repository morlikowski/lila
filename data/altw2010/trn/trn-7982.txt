'''Флаш-картата''' (от англ.- ''Flash-card'') e вид компактен и преносим носител на електронна информация.

Използва англ. - ''Flash-memory'') за съхранението и.

мини|Различни флаш-карти

Използва се във почти всички видове цифрови фотоапарати, както и в много други електронни устройства. Съществуват редица модели флаш-карти, като някои от тях са взаимозаменяеми, но повечето-не.
По физически размер коя да е флаш-карта обикновено е по-малка от стандартна кредитна карта.
Капацитетът, доскоро измерван в мебигибибайта [GiB].

Физическият принцип на работа е подобен на тази на EEPROM. 

300px|thumb|right|Four major types of memory cards (from left to right: [[CompactFlash, xD.]]

A '''memory card''' or '''flash memory card''' is a solid-state electronic handheld and Mobile computers, telephones, music players, video game consoles, and other electronics. They offer high re-record-ability, power-free storage, small form factor, and rugged environmental specifications. There are also non-solid-state memory cards that do not use flash memory, and there are different types of flash memory.

There are many different types of memory cards and jobs they are used for. Some common places include in digital cameras, in game consoles, in cell phones, and in industrial applications. PDAs and digital music players started using removable memory cards.

From the late 1990s into the early 2000s a host of new formats appeared, including SD/MMC, Memory Stick, xD-Picture Card, and a number of variants and smaller cards. The desire for ultra-small cards for cell-phones, PDAs, and compact digital cameras drove a trend toward smaller cards that left the previous generation of "compact" cards looking big. In digital cameras SmartMedia and CompactFlash had been very successful, in 2001 SM alone captured 50% of the digital camera market and CF had a strangle hold on professional digital cameras. By 2005 however, SD/MMC had nearly taken over SmartMedia's spot, though not to the same level and with stiff competition coming from Memory Stick variants, xD, as well as CompactFlash. In industrial fields, even the venerable PC card (PCMCIA) memory cards still manage to maintain a niche, while in cell-phones and PDAs, the memory card market is highly fragmented.

Nowadays, most new PCs have built-in slots for a variety of memory cards; Memory Stick, CompactFlash, SD, etc. Some digital gadgets support more than one memory card to ensure compatibility.

Since many EEPROM devices only allow a finite number of write cycles, some of these cards incorporate wear levelling algorithms to spread the wear and to avoid wearing out specific places which are often written to.
