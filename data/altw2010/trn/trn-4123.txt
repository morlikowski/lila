'''Sveti trije kralji''' je krščanski Mihe in Jezuščku. Ker so sveti trije kralji razglasili novico o Jezusovem rojstvu, se ta praznik v Cerkvi uradno imenuje '''Gospodovo razglašenje''' ali '''epifanija''' (grško:  [epifania] = razglasitev) oziroma tudi '''teofanija''' (grško: [theofania] = razglasitev boga). 

Sveto pismo govori o treh kraljih precej na splošno: imenuje jih modri oziroma učenjaki in ne navaja niti njihovega števila, niti imen. Ustrezni odstavek iz evangelija pravi:

<blockquote>
Ko je bil Jezus rojen v Betlehemu v Judeji v dneh kralja Heroda, so prišli modri z Vzhoda v Jeruzalem in govorili: »Kje je ta, ki se je rodil kot judovski kralj? Videli smo namreč, da je vzšla njegova zvezda, in smo se mu prišli poklonit.« 
(Mt 2, 1-2)
</blockquote>

Prepričanje, da so bili to kralji in da so bili trije, izvira iz legend, ki so nastale dosti pozneje (v nekaterih legendah lahko celo preberemo, da jih je bilo dvanajst). V 6. stoletju so se pojavila tudi ustrezna imena: Gašper (Kasper), Miha (Melhior) in Boltežar (Baltazar). V ljudski umetnosti so ponavadi upodobljeni tako, da je en od njih evropejec, en azijec in en črnec (ali vsaj temnopolt).

Na vratih cerkvenih objektov in hiš vernikov lahko vse leto vidimo napis G+M+B (kar pomeni svete tri kralje), poleg njih pa letnico tekočega leta.

V nekaterih Evrope je dela prost dan (Avstrija, Italija, Španija, Finska, Grčija, Ciper, Romunija, Litva, Češka in Slovaška). 

V pravoslavnih Cerkvah ponavadi praznujejo na isti dan (ponekod dan pozneje) tudi praznik Jezusovega krsta. Po katoliškem koledarju se praznuje Jezusov krst na prvo nedeljo po svetih treh kraljih.

V italiji so legendo o svetih treh kraljih dopolnili še z eno zanimivo osebo: to je dobra čarovnica '''Befana''' (ime izvira iz popačene oblike besede epifanija). Befana je po legendi pomagala kraljem najti pot do Jezusa. V današnjem času pa se Befana pojavlja kot obdarovalka otrok, ki v noči na 6. januar prinaša pridnim otrokom darila, porednim pa kepo premoga.

'''Epiphany''' (Greek for "to manifest" or "to show"), is a Christian God in human form in the person of Magi to the child Jesus on this day, i.e., his manifestation to the Gentiles. Eastern Christians commemorate the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River, his manifestation as the Son of God to the world.  It is also called '''Theophany''' ("manifestation of God"), especially by Eastern Christians.

==History==
The observance had its origins in the Eastern Christian Churches, and was originally a general celebration of the Incarnation of Magi, or "Wise Men" from Persia Magi's being Persian priests, who arrived in Jordan by Wedding of Cana in Galilee. However, it seems fairly clear that the Baptism was the event predominantly commemorated.<ref>Cyril Martindale, ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', Vol. 5 (Robert Appleton Company, New York 1905), s.v., [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05504c.htm Epiphany].</ref>

The date of the feast was very early fixed on January 6. Ancient Liturgies speak of ''Illuminatio, Manifestatio, Declaratio'' (Illumination, Manifestation, Declaration); cf. ; ; and ; where the Baptism and the Marriage at Cana are dwelt upon. Western Christians have traditionally emphasized the "Revelation to the Gentiles" mentioned in Luke, where the term Gentile means all non-Jewish peoples. The Biblical Magi, who represent the non-Jewish peoples of the world, paid homage to the infant Jesus in stark contrast to Herod the Great (King of Judea) who sought to kill him.<ref>Craig S. Keener, ''Matthew'', 1997, (InterVarsity Press, Downers Grove, Illinois, USA), ISBN 0-8308-1801-4, page 65.</ref>However, in this event there is also a revelation to the Children of Israel. Saint John Chrysostom identified the significance of the meeting between the Magi and Herod's court: "The star had been hidden from them so that, on finding themselves without their guide, they would have no alternative but to consult the Jews.  In this way the birth of Jesus would be made known to all."<ref>St John Chrysostom, ''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200107.htm Homilies on St Matthew'', 7]</ref> 

The earliest reference to Epiphany as a Christian feast was  in the year St. Epiphanius says that January 6 is ''hemera genethlion toutestin epiphanion'' (Christ's "Birthday; that is, His Epiphany").<ref>Epiphanius, ''Panarion'', li, 27, in Migne, ''Patrologia Graecae'' (P.G.), XLI, 936 (where it is called by its Latin name: ''Adversus Haereses'')</ref> He also asserts that the Miracle at Cana occurred on the same calendar day.<ref>Ibid., chapters xxviii and xxix P.G., XLI, 940 sq.</ref> although the celebration isn't celebrated as a public holiday many people in the eastern parts still celebrate

In Egeria (also known as Silvia) describes a celebration in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, which she calls "Epiphany" (''epiphania'') that obviously commemorates the Nativity of Christ.<ref>{{Citation

</ref> Even at this early date, there is already an octave associated with the feast.

In a sermon delivered on December 25, 380, St. Gregory of Nazianzus somewhat confusingly refers to the day as ''ta theophania'' ("the Theophany", an alternative name for Epiphany) saying expressly that it is a day commemorating ''he hagia tou Christou gennesis'' ("the holy nativity of Christ") and tells his listeners that they will soon be celebrating the baptism of Christ.<ref>St. Gregory Nazianzus, ''Oration xxxviii'' in P.G., XXXVI. 312</ref> Then, on January 6 and 7, he preached two more sermons<ref>Ibid., ''Orations xxxix'' and ''xl'' P.G., loc. cit.</ref> wherein he declared that the celebration of the birth of Christ and the visitation of the Magi had already taken place, and that they would now commemorate his Baptism.<ref>Ibid. col. 349.</ref> So at this point the two celebrations are beginning to be separated, at least in Cappadocia. 

However, this was not the case everywhere. Saint Egyptian monasteries still celebrated the Nativity and Baptism together on January 6.<ref>St. John Cassian, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/350810.htm ''Conferences'', X], 2, in Migne, ''Patrologia Latina'' (P.L.), XLIX; 820</ref> The Armenian Apostolic Church still continues to celebrate January 6 as the only commemoration of the Nativity.

==Epiphany in different Christian traditions==
Epiphany is celebrated by both the Eastern and Western Churches, but a major difference between them is over precisely which historical events the feast commemorates. For Western Christians the feast primarily commemorates the coming of the Magi, while in the East the feast celebrates the Baptism of Christ in the Jordan. However, in both cases the essence of the feast is the same: the manifestation of Christ to the world (whether as an infant or in the Jordan), and the Mystery of the Incarnation.

===Western Christian Churches ===

By the year 534 the Western Church had separated out the celebration of the Nativity of Christ into the feast of Christmas and set its date as December 25, reserving January 6 as a commemoration of the coming of the Magi. The East continued to celebrate January 6 as a composite feast, only later adopting December 25 to commemorate both Jesus' birth and the coming of the Magi, but leaving January 6 as a commemoration of his Baptism. Hungarians, perhaps because of their location between East and West, celebrate the coming of the Magi, but refer to the celebration as ''Vízkereszt'' or "water cross," clearly a reference to baptism.

====Liturgical practice in Western Churches====
The West generally acknowledges a twelve-day festival, starting on December 25, and ending on January 5, known as Christmastide or the twelve days of Christmas, although some Christian cultures, especially those of Latin America and some in Europe extend it to as many as forty days, ending on Candlemas (February 2).

On the Feast of the Epiphany itself, the priest, wearing white vestments, will bless the Epiphany Water, frankincense, gold, and chalk. Chalk is used to write the initials of the three magi over the doors of churches and homes. Not only do the letters stand for the initials of the Magi (traditionally named Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar), but of the phrase ''Christus mansionem benedicat'', which translates as "may Christ bless the house".

There is also an ancient custom of solemnly announcing the date of Easter on the feast of Epiphany. This tradition dates from a time when calendars were not readily available, and it was therefore necessary to make known the date of Easter in advance, since many celebrations of the liturgical year depend on it.<ref name="Missal">{{Citation

====Date of commemoration====
Prior to the reform of 1955, when octaves, the Roman Catholic Church (and prior to 1976, the Anglican churches) celebrated Epiphany as an eight-day feast beginning on 6 January and ending on 13 January, the Octave of Epiphany. The relatively few who continue to use this calendar include Traditionalist Catholics and the Anglican Catholic Church. They celebrate the feast of the Holy Family on the Sunday within the octave, and the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus on the Sunday between 2 January and 5 January or, if there is no such Sunday, on 2 January; and they reckon Christmastide as the twelve days ending on 5 January, followed by Epiphany time, consisting of the feast itself and its octave.

In the 1970 revision of the Roman Catholic calendar of saints Epiphany remains on 6 January for countries where the feast is a Holy Day of Obligation, but is celebrated in other countries on the Sunday after 1 January. Christmastide ends with the feast of the Baptism of the Lord, which in countries where the Epiphany is a Holy Day of Obligation is always on the Sunday after 6 January, but in other countries, whenever the Epiphany is celebrated on 7 or 8 January, falls on the following Monday.

The the Body and Blood of Christ, and the First Sunday of Advent in the following Liturgical Year.

In the Evening Prayer on the Eve of the Epiphany and ends at Evening Prayer (or Night Prayer) on the Feast of the Presentation (which may be celebrated on 2 February or on the Sunday between 28 January and 3 February).

===Eastern Christian Churches===

Usually called the '''Feast of Greek: Θεοφάνεια, "God shining forth" or "divine manifestation"), it is one of the Pascha (Easter) and Pentecost in importance.  Orthodox Christians celebrate Epiphany on January 6 (the date of January 6 on the Julian Calendar used by most Orthodox falls on January 19 of the modern Gregorian Calendar). 

The earliest reference to the feast in the Eastern Church is a remark by St. Clement of Alexandria in ''Stromateis'', I, xxi, 45:

<blockquote>And there are those who have determined not only the year of our Lord's birth, but also the day… And the followers of Basilides hold the day of his baptism as a festival, spending the night before in readings. And they say that it was the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar, the fifteenth day of the month of Tubi; and some that it was the eleventh of the same month.</blockquote>

(The 11th and 15th of Tubi are January 6th and 10th respectively.)

Origen's list of festivals (in ''Contra Celsum'', VIII, xxii) omits any reference to Epiphany. The first reference to an ecclesiastical feast of the Epiphany, in Ammianus Marcellinus (XXI:ii), is in 361.  

Today in Second Person of the Trinity at the time of his baptism.  It is also celebrated because, according to tradition, the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River by St. John the Baptist marked one of only two occasions when all three Persons of the Trinity manifested themselves simultaneously to humanity: God the Father by speaking through the clouds, God the Son being baptized in the river, and God the Holy Spirit in the shape of a dove descending from heaven (the other occasion was the Transfiguration on Mount Tabor). Thus the holy day is considered to be a Trinitarian feast. 

The Orthodox consider Jesus' Baptism to be the first step towards the Crucifixion, and there are some parallels in the hymnography used on this day and the hymns chanted on Good Friday. 

====Liturgical practice in Eastern Churches====
'''Forefeast''' The liturgical Forefeast of Theophany begins on January 1, and concludes with the Paramony on January 5.

'''Paramony''' The Greek: παραμονή, Slavonic: ''navechérie'').  Paramony is observed as a strict Nativity and Good Friday. The Royal Hours are followed by the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil which combines Vespers with the Divine Liturgy. During the Vespers, fifteen Old Testament lections which foreshadow the Baptism of Christ are read, and special antiphons are chanted.  If the Feast of the Theophany falls on a Sunday or Monday, the Royal Hours are chanted on the previous Friday, and on the Paramony the Vesperal Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom is celebrated and the fasting is lessened to some degree.
