==Jews and Judaism== 

The origin of the Jews is traditionally dated to around the second millennium BCE to the patriarchs, monotheistic religion, developed over a period of thousands of years. According to Biblical accounts, the Jews enjoyed periods of King David established United Kingdom of Israel and Judah, also known as the ''United Monarchy'', and from there ruled the Twelve Tribes of Israel.

In 970 BCE, David's son king of Israel.<ref name="wwbible"></ref> Within a decade, Solomon began to build the Holy Temple known as the ''First Temple''. Upon Solomon's death (c. 930 BCE), the ten northern tribes split off to form the Kingdom of Israel. In 722 BCE the Assyrians conquered the Kingdom of Israel and exiled its Jews, starting a Jewish diaspora. At a time of limited mobility and travel, Jews became some of the first and most visible immigrants.

The First Temple period ended around 586 BCE as the Babylonians conquered the Persian King Darius the Great seventy years after the destruction of the First Temple.<ref></ref><ref></ref> When Hellenistic Greek control, eventually falling to the Seleucids. The Seleucid attempt to recast Jerusalem as a Hellenized High Priest and his five sons against Antiochus Epiphanes, and their establishment of the Hasmonean Kingdom in 152 BCE with Jerusalem again as its capital.<ref></ref> The Hasmonean Kingdom lasted over one hundred years, but then as Rome became stronger it installed Herod as a Jewish client king. The Herodian Kingdom also lasted over a hundred years. Defeats by the Jews in the First revolt in 70 CE, the first of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE notably contributed to the numbers and Islamic Spain and Portugal, Emancipating Germany and Poland, or the contemporary Liberal Democracies of the United States, Australia or United Kingdom).

The Hebrew noun "Yehudi" (plural ''Yehudim'') originally referred to the tribe of Judah.<ref></ref> Later, when the Northern Etymology). Its first use in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) to refer to the Jewish people as a whole is in the Book of Esther.

==Etymology==

There are many different views as to the origin of the Greek ''Ioudaios'' (''''). The Latin simply means ''Judaean'', from the land of ''Judaea''. Judaea is in turn derived from Judah which was the name of the Kingdom of Judah, and one of the Tribes of Israel. The Hebrew word for Jew, יהודי , is pronounced .

The etymological equivalent is in use in other languages, e.g., "Jude" in German, "juif" in French, "jøde," in Danish, in Spanish (judío),  etc., but derivations of the word "Hebrew" are also in use to describe a Jewish person, e.g., in Italian (Ebreo), and , (''Yevrey''). The German word "Jude" is pronounced  and is the origin of the word Yiddish. (See Jewish ethnonyms for a full overview.)

==Who is a Jew?==

converted to Judaism and therefore are followers of the religion.<ref> </ref> At times conversion has accounted for a substantial part of Jewish population growth. In the first century of the Christian era, for example, the population more than doubled, from 4 to 8–10 million within the confines of the Roman Empire, in good part as a result of a wave of conversion.<ref>Bauer, Yehuda. [http://web.archive.org/web/20030705131522/http://humanities.ucsc.edu/JewishStudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf "Problems of Contemporary Anti-Semitism"], 2003, p. 2. Retrieved February 24, 2008.</ref>

Historical definitions of halakhic definitions of matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions. Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the oral tradition into the Babylonian Talmud. Interpretations of sections of the Ezra 10:2-3, where Israelites returning from Babylon, vow to put aside their gentile wives and their children. Since the Haskalah, these halakhic interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.

==Ethnic divisions==

thumb|right|[[Ashkenazi Jews of late 19th century Eastern Europe portrayed in ''Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur'' (1878), by Maurycy Gottlieb.]]
Within the world's self-identifying political, cultural, natural, and Jewish cultural expressions of each community, including Jewish linguistic diversity, culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources of genetic admixture.

Jews are often identified as belonging to one of two major groups: the ''Iberia" in Hebrew, denoting their Spanish and Portuguese base). The ''Mizrahim'', or "Easterners" (Mizrach being "East" in Hebrew), that is, the diverse collection of Middle Eastern and North African Jews, constitute a third major group, although European Jews sometimes refer to them as Sephardim.

Smaller Jewish cultural groups include the Indian Jews including the African Jews, including most numerously the Chinese Jews, most notably the Kaifeng Jews, as well as various other distinct but now extinct communities.

The divisions between all these groups are approximate and their boundaries are not always clear. The Caucasian, and Middle Eastern Jewish communities which are often as unrelated to each other as they are to any of the earlier mentioned Jewish groups. In modern usage. However, the Mizrahim are also termed ''Sephardi'' due to similar styles of liturgy, despite independent development from Sephardim proper. Thus, among Mizrahim there are Iraqi Jews, Egyptian Jews, Berber Jews, Lebanese Jews, Kurdish Jews, Libyan Jews, Syrian Jews, Bukharian Jews, Mountain Jews, Georgian Jews, and various others. The Teimanim from Yemen and Oman are sometimes included, although their style of liturgy is unique and they differ in respect to the admixture found among them to that found in Mizrahim. In addition, there is a differentiation made between Sephardi migrants who established themselves in the Middle East and North Africa after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Portugal in the 1490s and the pre-existing Jewish communities in those regions.

Despite this diversity, Ashkenazi Jews represent the bulk of modern Jewry, with at least 70% of Jews worldwide (and up to 90% prior to World War II and the Holocaust).<ref></ref> As a result of their emigration from Europe during the wartime periods, Ashkenazim also represent the overwhelming majority of Jews in the New World continents and in countries previously without native Jewish communities, such as the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and South Africa. In France, emigration of Mizrahim from North Africa has led them to outnumber pre-existing European Jews. Only in Israel is the Jewish population representative of all groups, a melting pot independent of each group's proportion within the overall world Jewish population.

===DNA evidence===
A study published by the National Academy of Sciences found that "the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East descended from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population", and suggested that "most Jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring non-Jewish communities during and after the Diaspora".<ref name="hammer"/> Researchers expressed surprise at the remarkable genetic uniformity they found among modern Jews, no matter where the diaspora has become dispersed around the world.<ref name="hammer"/> The DNA tests demonstrated substantially less inter-marriage among Jews over the last 3,000 years than found in other populations.<ref name="New York Times Y Chromosome"/> The tests support traditional Jewish history and counter theories that the Jewish people are descended mostly from converts from other religions, such as the Khazars.<ref name="New York Times Y Chromosome"></ref><ref></ref>

Another of the study's findings is that by the yardstick of the Y chromosome, the world's Jewish communities are closely related to Syrians and Palestinians.<ref>Hammer, ''et al''. Figure 2: [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/12/6769/F2 Plot of populations based on Y-chromosome haplotype data].</ref>  The study's authors wrote that "the extremely close affinity of Jewish and non-Jewish Middle Eastern populations observed ... supports the hypothesis of a common Middle Eastern origin",<ref name="hammer"></ref> as does the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of at least 40% of the current Ashkenazi population.<ref name="behar"></ref> So although Khazars could have been absorbed into the modern Jewish population, it is unlikely that they formed a large percentage of the ancestors of modern Ashkenazi Jews.<ref></ref>

DNA analysis further determined that modern Jews of the priesthood tribe — "Cohanim" — share a common ancestor in Israel dating back about 3,000 years.<ref name="hammer2"/> This result is consistent for all Jewish populations around the world.<ref name="hammer2"></ref> The researchers estimated that the most recent common ancestor of modern Cohanim lived between 1000 BCE (roughly the time of the Biblical Exodus) and 586 BCE, when the First Temple.<ref name="American Society For Technion"/> They found similar results analyzing DNA from Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews.<ref name="American Society For Technion"></ref> The scientists estimated the date of the original priest based on genetic mutations, which indicated that the priest lived roughly 106 generations ago, between 2,650 and 3,180 years ago depending whether one counts a generation as 25 or 30 years.<ref name="American Society For Technion"/>

===State of Israel===

The early years of the state of Israel, were marked by the mass immigration of Holocaust survivors and Jews fleeing Arab lands.<ref name="persecution">. "And most [Oriental-Sephardic Jews] came... because of Arab persecution resulting from the very attempt to establish a Jewish state in Palestine."</ref> Israel also has a large population of Ashkenazi Holocaust survivors who had settled in countries such as the United States, Argentina, and South Africa. Some Jews have emigrated from Israel elsewhere, due to economic problems or disillusionment with political conditions and the continuing Arab-Israeli conflict. Jewish Israeli emigrants are known as yordim.

===Diaspora (outside Israel)===

The waves of immigration to the United States and elsewhere at the turn of the nineteenth century and later due to various causes, including the pogroms in Russia, the massacre of European Jewry during the Holocaust, and the foundation of the state of Israel (and subsequent Jewish exodus from Arab lands), all resulted in substantial shifts in the population centers of world Jewry by the end of the twentieth century.

Currently, the largest Jewish community in the world is located in the United States, with almost 5.7 million Jews. Elsewhere in the Americas, there are also large Jewish populations in Canada, Argentina, and Brazil, and smaller populations in Mexico (45,000),<ref name="tabulados">[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2000/definitivos/Nal/tabulados/00re01.pdf 2000 Tabulados de Religión]</ref> Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, and several other countries (see History of the Jews in Latin America).

Western Europe's largest Jewish community can be found in Eastern Europe, there are anywhere from 500,000 to over two million Jews living in the former Soviet Union, but exact figures are difficult to establish. The fastest-growing Jewish community in the world, outside Israel, is the one in Germany, especially in Berlin, its capital.<ref></ref> Tens of thousands of Jews from the former Eastern Bloc have settled in Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Outside Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and the rest of Asia, there are significant Jewish populations in Australia and South Africa.

===Population changes: Assimilation===
Since at least the time of the Ancient Greeks, a proportion of Jews have assimilated into the wider non-Jewish society around them, by either choice or force, ceasing to practice Judaism and losing their Jewish communities, for example the Diaspora have steady or slightly declining religiously Jewish populations as Jews continue to assimilate into the countries in which they live.

===Population changes: Wars against the Jews===

Throughout history, many rulers, empires and nations have oppressed their Jewish populations or sought to eliminate them entirely. Methods employed ranged from expulsion to outright genocide; within nations, often the threat of these extreme methods was sufficient to silence dissent. The Final Solution, which led to the Holocaust and the slaughter of approximately 6 million Jews from 1942 to 1945. 

According to James Carroll, "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the Roman Empire. By that ratio, if other factors had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million."<ref>Carroll, James. ''epidemics, migration, assimilation, and conversion could all have played major roles in the current size of the global Jewish population.

===Population changes: Growth===
Israel is the only country with a consistently growing Jewish population due to natural population increase, though the Jewish populations of other countries in Europe and North America have recently increased due to immigration. In the Diaspora, in almost every country the Jewish population in general is either declining or steady, but Orthodox and Haredi Jewish communities, whose members often shun birth control for religious reasons, have experienced rapid population growth.<ref></ref>

Orthodox and Conservative Judaism discourage proselytization to non-Jews, but many Jewish groups have tried to reach out to the assimilated Jewish communities of the Diaspora in order to increase the number of Jews. Additionally, while in principle Reform Judaism favors seeking new members for the faith, this position has not translated into active proselytism, instead taking the form of an effort to reach out to non-Jewish spouses of intermarried couples. There is also a trend of Orthodox movements pursuing secular Jews in order to give them a stronger Jewish identity so there is less chance of intermarriage. As a result of the efforts by these and other Jewish groups over the past twenty-five years, there has been a trend of secular Jews becoming more religiously observant, known as the ''Baal Teshuva'' movement, though the demographic implications of the trend are unknown. Additionally, there is also a growing movement of Jews by Choice by gentiles who make the decision to head in the direction of becoming Jews.

==Jewish languages==

Hebrew is the Greek. Modern Hebrew is now one of the two official languages of the State of Israel along with Arabic.

Hebrew was revived as a spoken language by Tannaic times.<ref name=Grintz/>
For over sixteen centuries Hebrew was used almost exclusively as a liturgical language, and as the language in which most books had been written on Judaism, with a few speaking only Hebrew on the Sabbath.<ref>Parfitt, T. V. "The Use of Hebrew in Palestine 1800–1822." ''Journal of Semitic Studies '', 1972.</ref> For centuries, Jews worldwide have spoken the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to, often developing distinctive Yiddish is the Judæo-German language developed by Ladino is the Judæo-Spanish language developed by Sephardic Jews who migrated to the Judæo-Arabic, Judæo-Berber, Krymchak, Judæo-Malayalam and many others, have largely fallen out of use.

The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are English, modern Hebrew, and Russian. Some Romance languages, such as French and Spanish, are also widely used.<ref></ref>

==Jewish culture==

Hellenic world, in Islamic Spain and Portugal, in India and China, or the contemporary United States and Israel, cultural phenomena have developed that are in some sense characteristically Jewish without being at all specifically religious. Some factors in this come from within Judaism, others from the interaction of Jews or specific communities of Jews with their surroundings, others from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community, as opposed to from the religion itself. This phenomenon has led to considerably different Jewish cultures unique to their own communities, each as authentically Jewish as the next.

===Jews and migrations===

Throughout Jewish history, Jews have repeatedly been directly or indirectly expelled from both their original homeland, and the areas in which they have resided. This experience as both immigrants and emigrants (see: Jewish refugees) have shaped Jewish identity and religious practice in many ways, and are thus a major element of Jewish history. An incomplete list of such migrations includes:

*The patriarch Chaldees.
*The Children of Israel experienced the Exodus (meaning "departure" or "exit" in Greek) from ancient Egypt, as recorded in the Book of Exodus.
*The Kingdom of Israel was sent into permanent exile and scattered all over the world (or at least to unknown locations) by Assyria.
*The Kingdom of Judah was exiled by Babylonia, then returned to Judea, and then many were exiled again by the Roman Empire.
*The 2,000 year dispersion of the Babylonia to the Iberian Peninsula to Poland to the United States and to Israel.
*Many expulsions during the Middle Ages and Enlightenment in Europe, including: 1290, 16,000 Jews were expelled from England, see the ''(Statute of Jewry)''; in 1396, 100,000 from France; in 1421 thousands were expelled from Austria. Many of these Jews settled in Eastern Europe, especially Poland.
*Following the Southern Europe and the Middle East.
*During the 19th century, Napoleon Bonaparte.
*The arrival of millions of Jews in the New World, including immigration of over two million Eastern European Jews to the United States from 1880-1925, see History of the Jews in the United States and History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union.
*The Pogroms in Eastern Europe, the rise of modern Anti-Semitism, the Holocaust and the rise of Arab nationalism all served to fuel the movements and migrations of huge segments of Jewry from land to land and continent to continent, until they arrived back in large numbers at their original historical homeland in Israel.
*The Islamic Revolution of Iran forced many Iranian Jews to flee Iran. Most found refuge in the US (particularly Los Angeles, CA) and Israel. Smaller communities of Persian Jews exist in Canada and Western Europe.<ref></ref>
*When the Soviet Union died, many of the Jews in the affected territory (who had been refuseniks) were suddenly allowed to leave. This produced a wave of migration to Israel in the early 1990s.

===Kingdoms of Israel and Judah===

Jews descend mostly from the ancient biblical patriarch Saul and continued under King David and Solomon. King David conquered Jerusalem (first a Canaanite, then a Jebusite town) and made it his capital. After Solomon's reign, the nation split into two kingdoms, the Kingdom of Israel (in the north) and the Kingdom of Judah (in the south). The Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Assyrian ruler Shalmaneser V in the 8th century BCE and spread all over the Assyrian empire, where they were assimilated into other cultures and came to be known as the Ten Lost Tribes. The Kingdom of Judah continued as an independent state until it was conquered by a Babylonian army in the early 6th century BCE, destroying the First Temple that was at the centre of Jewish worship. The Judean elite was exiled to Babylonia, but later at least a part of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of Babylonia by the Persians seventy years later, a period known as the Babylonian Captivity. A new Second Temple was constructed funded by Persian Kings, and old religious practices were resumed.

===Persian, Greek, and Roman rule===
:''See related article Jewish-Roman wars''.

The Hellenized Jews (those who had adopted Greek culture), attempted to convert the Jewish Temple to a temple of Idumean family and became a very successful client king under the Romans. He significantly expanded the Temple in Jerusalem.

Upon his death in 4 BCE the Romans directly ruled Judea and there were frequent changes of policies by conflicting and empire-building Caesars, generals, governors, and consuls who often acted cruelly or attempted to maximize their own wealth and power. Rome's attitudes swung from tolerance to hostility against its Jewish subjects, who had since moved throughout the Empire. The Romans, worshiping a large pantheon, could not readily accommodate the exclusive revolt against Rome. The revolt was smashed by Titus Flavius, the son and successor of the menorah'' being brought to Rome. It is customary for Jews to walk around, rather than through, this arch.<ref></ref>

The Romans destroyed most of Simon Bar Kokhba. Hadrian responded with overwhelming force, putting down the revolt and killing as many as half a million Jews.<ref>Johnson (1987), p. 142.</ref> After the Roman Legions prevailed in 135, Jews were not allowed to enter the city of Jerusalem and most Jewish worship was forbidden by Rome.<ref>Johnson (1987), p. 143.</ref> Following the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews, Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple, and instead the rabbis took on a more prominent position as teachers and leaders of individual communities. No new books were added to the Jewish Bible after the Roman period,<ref>Johnson (1987), pp. 95-96.</ref> instead major efforts went into interpreting and developing the Halakhah, or oral law, and writing down these traditions in the Talmud, the key work on the interpretation of Jewish law, written during the first to fifth centuries CE.<ref>Johnson (1987), p. 152.</ref>

In 212, all Jews were made citizens of the Roman empire.  Christianity became the sole state religion of the declining Roman empire, when Constantine I issued the Edict of Milan in 313. Jewish and Christian life evolved in "diametrically opposite directions" during the final centuries of Roman empire.<ref>Salo Wittmayer Baron, “A Social and Religious History of the Jews,”  Volume II,  Ancient Times, Part II.  Jewish Publication Society of America, 1952.p. 200</ref> Jewish life became autonomous, decentralized, and community-centered, in contrast to Christian life, which  became a rigid hierarchical system under the supreme authority of the Pope and the Roman Emperor.

Jewish life after the fall of Israel was basically democratic.<ref>Salo Wittmayer Baron, “A Social and Religious History of the Jews,”  Volume II,  Ancient Times, Part II.  Jewish Publication Society of America, 1952. p200 </ref>  Rabbis in the Talmud interpreted Deuteronomy 29:9, “your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel” as “Although I have appointed for you heads, elders, and officers, you are all equal before me” (Tanhuma).  The Talmud stressed that rights always entailed responsibilities: “you are all responsible for one another.”  

Jewish survival in the face of external pressures from the now Catholic Roman empire and Persian Zoroastrian empire is seen as ‘enigmatic’ by many historians.<ref>Salo Wittmayer Baron, “A Social and Religious History of the Jews,”  Volume II,  Ancient Times, Part II.  Jewish Publication Society of America, 1952.p. 215</ref> For example, Wilhelm von Humboldt wrote “such an extraordinary phenomenon in world history and the history of religion that many a fine mind has doubted whether it can at all be explained in merely human terms”<ref>ibid, p. 215</ref>  

According to the famous Jewish historian, Salo Wittmayer Baron, a number of mechanisms of Jewish survival evolved during these crucial centuries between the fall of Israel and the fall of Rome.  He describes at least eight factors that strengthened Judaism and Jewish society.
 
1.	Messianic faith.  Belief in an ultimately positive outcome and restoration of Israel.

2.	Doctrine of the Hereafter was increasingly elaborated.  Belief in an afterlife had been largely ignored during Biblical times.  Now it was discussed more by the sages.  It reconciled Jews with suffering in this world and helped them resist outside temptations to convert.

3.	Suffering was given meaning through interpretation of Jewish history and destiny.

4.	Doctrine of martyrdom and inescapability of persecution transformed both into a source of communal solidarity. 

5.	Jewish daily life was very satisfying.  Although living throughout the Roman empire and Persian empire and beyond, Jews lived among Jews.  In practice, in a lifetime, most Jews encountered overt persecution only on a few dramatic occasions.  They mostly lived under discrimination that affected everyone, and to which they were habituated.  Daily life was governed by a multiplicity of ritual requirements, so that Jews were constantly aware of their relationship with God throughout the day.  “For the most part, he found this all-encompassing Jewish way of life so eminently satisfactory that he was prepared to sacrifice himself…for the preservation of its fundamentals.”<ref>Salo Wittmayer Baron, “A Social and Religious History of the Jews,”  Volume II,  Ancient Times, Part II.  Jewish Publication Society of America, 1952. p. 216</ref> Those commandments for which Jews had sacrificed their lives, such as defying idolatry, eating pork, observing circumcision, were the ones most strictly adhered to.
  
6.	The corporate developement and segregationist policies of late Roman empire and Persian empire, helped keep Jewish community organization strong.
