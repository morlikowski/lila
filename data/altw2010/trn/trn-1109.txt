==ქრისტიანობის წარმოშობა==

ქრისტიანობა წარმოიშვა იუდაიზმის წიაღში ახ.წ. 1-ელ საუკუნეში რომის იმპერიის აღმოსავლეთ ნაწილში -  პალესტინაში. ახალი მოძღვრება ბერძნული და ლათინური ენების წყალობით იოლად ვრცელდებოდა უზარმაზარ რომის იმპერიაში. გადმოცემის თანახმად, ინდოეთში და სპარსეთში, კავკასიასა და ბალკანეთში, ეგვიპტეში. ქრისტიანული გადმოცემის თანახმად პირველ ქრისტიანეთა ხვედრი მძიმე იყო, მათ დევნიდნენ, დასცინოდნენ, სხვადასხვა ბრალდებებს უყენებდნენ. პეტრე და პავლე 64 წელს აწამეს რომში, მოციქულთაგან უკანასკნელი გარდაიცვალა იოანე. მოციქულები შეცვალეს ეკლესიის მამებმა. ქრისტიანული გადმოცემების თანახმად მათაც დევნიდნენ, აწამებდნენ, კლავდნენ. ქრისტიანობას მალე გამოუჩნდნენ დამცველები თვით რომის იმპერიაში. იმპერატორმა კონსტანტინემ ცნობილი "სასწაულის" შემდეგ იწამა და ნება დართო ღვთისმსახურებისა. ასე თანდათან იკვალავდა გზას ახალი ჰუმანური მოძღვრება.

==ქრისტიანული სწავლება==

ქრისტიანული სწავლება ძირითადად მოიცავს ათ მცნებას:

*1. მე ვარ უფალი ღმერთი შენი, და არა იყვნენ შენდა ღმერთნი უცხონი, ჩემსა გარეშე.
*2. არა ჰქმნე თავისა შენისა კერპი, არცა ყოვლადვე მსგავსი, რაოდენი არს ცათა შინა ზე, და რაოდენი არს ქვეყანასა ზედა ქვე, და რაოდენი არს წყალთა შინა ქვეშე ქვეყანისა: არა თაყვანი-სცე მათ, არცა მსახურებდე მათ.
*3. არა მოიღო სახელი უფლისა ღვთისა შენისა ამაოსა ზედა.
*4. მოიხსენე დღე იგი შაბათი და წმიდა-ჰყავ იგი: ექვს დღე იქმოდე, და ჰქმნე მათ შინა ყოველივე საქმე შენი, ხოლო დღე იგი მეშვიდე შაბათი არს უფლისა ღვთისა შენისა.
*5. პატივ-ეც მამასა შენსა და დედასა შენსა, რათა კეთილი გეყოს შენ და დღეგრძელ იყო ქვეყანასა ზედა.
*6. არა კაც-ჰკლა. 
*7. არ იმრუშო.
*8. არ იპარო.
*9. არა ცილი-სწამო მოყვასსა შენსა წამებითა ცრუითა.
*10. არა გული გითქმიდეს ცოლისათვის მოყვასისა შენისა, არა გული     გითქმიდეს სახლისათვის მოყვასისა შენისა, არცა ყანისა მისისა, არცა კარაულისა მისისა, არცა ყოვლისა საცხოვარისა მისისა, არცა ყოვლისა მისთვის, რაიცა იყვეს მოყვასისა შენისა.

==ქრისტიანობა საქართველოში==

''ძირითადი სტატია: ქრისტიანობა საქართველოში''

საქართველოს ქართლში ქრისტიანობის სახელმწიფო რელიგიად გამოცხადებისთანავე - დაახლოებით 326 წელს. საქართველოს მართლმადიდებელი ეკლესია იერარქიულად საბერძნეთის ეკლესიას ექვემდებარებოდა.
V საუკუნეში ვახტანგ გორგასალმა მცხეთის საეპისკოპოსო შეცვალა ქართლის საკათალიკოსოთი და კათალიკოსი ანტიოქიის პატრიარქისგან დამოუკიდებელი გახადა. ამგვარად ვახტანგ გორგასალმა ქართლის ეკლესიას ავტოკეფალიის უფლება მოუპოვა.
დაახლოებით IX - X საუკუნეებში დასავლეთ საქართველოს ეკლესია - აფხაზეთის საკათალიკოსო გამოვიდა კონსტანტინოპოლის პატრიარქის დაქვემდებარებიდან და ქართლის საკათალიკოსოს დაექვემდებარა.
XI საუკუნიდან საქართველოს მართლმდიდებელი ეკლესიის უმაღლესი მესაჭე კათალიკოს-პატრიარქის ატარებდა და რიგით მეექვსე იყო მსოფლიო პატრიარქთა შორის. 1054 წლის საეკლესიო განხეთქილების შემდეგ კი მართლმადიდებლურ სამყაროში დარჩენილმა საქართველოს კათალიკოს-პატრიარქმა მეხუთე ადგილზე გადმოინაცვლა ალექსანდრიის, ანტიოქიის, კონსტანტინეპოლისა და იერუსალიმის პატრიარქებს შორის.

ივანე ჯავახიშვილის აზრით, ქრისტიანობის ისტორია საქართველოში III საუკუნის დამდეგიდან იწყება, ხოლო ოფიციალურ თარიღად ცნობილი 326 წელი სარწმუნოების ოფიციალურად გამოცხადებას ეხება, რაც ყველა ქვეყანაში უფრო გვიან ხდებოდა.  ქრისტიანობის გავრცელებას საქართველოში წმინდა ნინოს მიაწერენ.

==Beliefs==
thumb|250px|right|The [[Sermon On the Mount by Carl Heinrich Bloch, Danish painter, d. 1890.]]
In spite of important differences of interpretation and opinion, Christians share a set of beliefs that they hold as essential to their faith.<ref name="Olsen">Olson, Roger E. ''The Mosaic of Christian Belief.'' InterVarsity Press (2002). ISBN 9780830826957.</ref> 

=== Jesus Christ ===

The focus of a Christian's life is a firm belief in Hebrew word מָשִׁיחַ (''māšiáħ'') meaning ''anointed one''. The Greek translation  (''Christos'') is the source of the English word "Christ".<ref>McGrath, Alister E. ''Christianity:An Introduction''. Pp 4-6. Blackwell Publishing (2006). ISBN 1405108991.</ref>thumb|200px|left|A depiction of Jesus and Mary, the [[Theotokos of Vladimir (12th century)]]

Christians believe that, as the Messiah, Jesus was anointed by God as ruler and savior of humanity, and hold that Jesus' coming was the fulfillment of messianic prophecies of the the contemporary Jewish concept. The core Christian belief is that, through the death and resurrection of Jesus, sinful humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life.<ref>Metzger, Bruce M. and Michael Coogan, editors. ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. Pp 513, 649. Oxford University Press (1993). ISBN 0195046455.</ref>

While there have been theological disputes over the nature of Jesus, Christians generally believe that Jesus is God incarnate and "true God and true man" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become fully human, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not ascended to return again<ref></ref> to fulfil the rest of Messianic prophecy such as the Resurrection of the dead, the Last Judgment and final establishment of the Kingdom of God.

According to the Matthew and Luke, Jesus was conceived by the born from the Virgin Mary. Little of Jesus' childhood is recorded in the his baptism, miracles, preaching, teaching, and deeds.

=== Death and resurrection of Jesus ===

thumb|left|150px|The Crucifixion by Diego Velázquez (17th century)

Christians consider the resurrection of Jesus to be the cornerstone of their faith  and the most important event in human history.<ref>Hanegraaff, Hank. ''Resurrection: The Capstone in the Arch of Christianity''. Thomas Nelson (2000) IBSN 0849916437 .</ref> Within the body of Christian beliefs, the death and resurrection of Jesus are two core events  on which much of Christian doctrine and theology depend.<ref name="ACU-Death & Resurrection"></ref><ref name="Got Questions-Death & Resurrection"></ref> According to the crucified, died, buried within a tomb, and resurrected three days later.<ref>, , </ref> The New Testament mentions several disciples, including "more than five hundred brethren at once",<ref></ref> before Jesus' Ascension to liturgical time of interfaith dialogues.<ref>Lorenzen, Thorwald. ''Resurrection, Discipleship, Justice: Affirming the Resurrection Jesus Christ Today''. Smyth & Helwys (2003), p. 13. ISBN 1573123994 .</ref>

Paul the Apostle, an early Christian convert, wrote, "If Christ was not raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your trust in God is useless".<ref>)</ref><ref>Ball, Bryan and William Johnsson, editors. ''The Essential Jesus''. Pacific Press (2002).

Generally, Christian churches accept and teach the New Testament account of the resurrection of Jesus.<ref>This is drawn from a number of sources, especially the early Creeds, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, certain theological works, and various Confessions drafted during the Reformation including the Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England, works contained in the Book of Concord, and others.</ref><ref>Two denominations in which a resurrection of Jesus is not a doctrine are the Quakers and the Unitarians.</ref> Some modern scholars use the belief of Jesus' followers in the resurrection as a point of departure  for establishing the continuity of the historical Jesus and the proclamation of the early church.<ref>Fuller, Reginald H.

=== Soteriology ===

Soteriology is the branch of Christian theology that deals with salvation through Jesus Christ.<ref>title

Christians believe that, through faith in Jesus, one can be saved from atoning sacrifice, which, in the words of the justification.<ref>Metzger, Bruce M. and Michael Coogan, editors. ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. p. 405 Oxford University Press  (1993). ISBN 0-19-504645-5.</ref> 

The operation and effects of grace are understood differently by different traditions. Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy teach the necessity of the incapable of self-redemption, but the grace of God overcomes even the unwilling heart.<ref>Westminster Confession, [http://www.pcanet.org/general/cof_chapvi-x.htm#chapx Chapter X];

=== Trinity ===

''Trinity'' refers to the teaching that the one God comprises three distinct, eternally co-existing persons; the ''Father'' (from whom the Son and Spirit proceed), the ''Son'' (incarnate in Jesus Christ), and the ''Godhead,<ref>J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines'', p. 87-90.</ref><ref>T. Desmond Alexander, ''New Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', p. 514-515</ref><ref>Alister E. McGrath, ''Historical Theology'' p. 61.</ref> although there is no single term in use in Scripture to denote the unified Godhead.<ref>Metzger, Bruce M. and Michael Coogan, editors. ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. Pg. 782 Oxford University Press  (1993). ISBN 0-19-504645-5.</ref> In the words of the Athanasian Creed, an early statement of Christian belief, "the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, and yet there are not three Gods but one God.".<ref>J.N.D. Kelly, ''The Athanasian Creed'', NY: Harper and Row, 1964.</ref>

The Trinity is an essential doctrine of mainstream Christianity. "Father, Son and Holy Spirit" represents both the immanence and transcendence of God. God is believed to be infinite and God's presence may be perceived through the actions of Jesus and the Holy Spirit.<!--ref supports entire paragraph --><ref>Fowler, Jeaneane D. ''World Religions:An Introduction for Students''. p.&nbsp;58. Sussex Academic Press (1997). ISBN 1898723486.</ref>

According to this doctrine, God is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is considered to be fully God (see eternal and omnipotent. 

The word ''trias'', from which ''trinity'' is derived, is first seen in the works of Theophilus of Antioch. He wrote of "the Trinity of God (the Father), His Word (the Son) and His Wisdom (Holy Spirit)".<ref>Theophilus of Antioch ''Apologia ad Autolycum'' II 15</ref> The term may have been in use before this time. Afterwards it appears in Tertullian.<ref>McManners, John. ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. Pg 50. Oxford University Press (1990) IBSN 0198229283.</ref><ref>Tertullian ''De Pudicitia'' chapter 21</ref> In the following century the word was in general use. It is found in many passages of Origen.<ref>McManners, John. ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. Pg 53. Oxford University Press (1990) IBSN 0198229283.</ref>

==== Trinitarians ====
The term ''trinitarian'' denotes those Christians who hold to a belief in the concept of ''Trinity''. The vast majority of Christian denominations hold Trinitarian beliefs, including the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox churches and the vast majority of Protestant denominations.

It is thought by Trinitarian Christians that knowledge of the Trinitarian nature of God was revealed in Jesus Christ, and that belief in this nature is fundamental to Christian theology. 

==== Non-trinitarians ====

beliefs systems that reject the doctrine of the Trinity. Various nontrinitarian views, such as adoptionism and Arianism, existed before the Trinity was formally defined as doctrine in AD&nbsp;325.<ref></ref> Nontrinitarianism later appeared again in the Gnosticism of the Cathars in the 11th through 13th centuries, in the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, and in Restorationism during the 19th century. The nontrinitarian view was rejected by many early Christian bishops such as Irenaeus and subsequently by the Ecumenical Councils.<ref>McManners, John. ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. Pg 35. Oxford University Press (1990) IBSN 0198229283.</ref> During the Reformation some nontrinitarians rejected these councils as spiritually tainted,<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid. ''The Reformation: A History''. Viking Adult (2004), p. 185-187.</ref> though most Christians continued to accept the value of many of the councils.  

Sabellians.<ref> J. N. D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines'', p. 119-123</ref><ref>Robert Letham, ''The Holy Trinity: In Scripture, History, Theology, and Worship'', p. 97-98.</ref> Latter-day Saints (commonly called Mormons) accept the divinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but deny that they are the same being. Rather, they believe them to be separate beings united perfectly in will and purpose, thus making up one single Godhead. They believe that the Father, like the Son, has a glorified physical body.<ref>''Doctrine and Covenants'' 130:22</ref>

=== Scriptures ===

Christianity regards the canonical books in two parts (the inerrant word of God.<ref>books that are considered canon in the Bible vary depending upon the denomination using or defining it. These variations are a reflection of the range of councils that have convened on the subject. The Bible always includes books of the Jewish scriptures, the Greek<ref>[http://www.pcusa.org/101/101-bible.htm PC(USA) - Presbyterian 101 - What is The Bible?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. The Roman Catholic and Orthodox canons include other books from the Deuterocanonical.<ref name="Canon">F.F. Bruce, ''The Canon of Scripture''; Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#IV, ''The Canon of Scripture'' § 120]</ref> Protestants consider these books apocryphal. Some versions of the Christian Bible have a separate Apocrypha section for the books not considered canonical by the publisher<ref>Metzger, Bruce M. and Michael Coogan, editors. ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. Pg. 39 Oxford University Press  (1993). ISBN 0-19-504645-5.</ref> . Some groups, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, have additional books that they also consider to be scripture.

==== Interpretation ====

Though Christians largely agree on the content of the Bible, there is significant divergence in its interpretation, or Antioch. Alexandrine interpretation, exemplified by allegorically, while Antiochene interpretation adhered to the literal sense, holding that other meanings (called ''theoria'') could only be accepted if based on the literal meaning.<ref>J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines'', p. 69-78.</ref>

===== Roman Catholic =====

Roman Catholic theology distinguishes two senses of scripture: the literal and the spiritual.<ref> Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III, ''The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture'' § 115-118]</ref>

The ''literal'' sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture and discovered by exegesis, following the rules of sound interpretation. It has three subdivisions: the allegorical, moral, and anagogical (meaning mystical or spiritual) senses.

* The ''allegorical'' sense includes typology. An example would be the parting of the Red Sea being understood as a "type" (sign) of baptism.<ref></ref>
* The ''moral'' sense understands the scripture to contain some ethical teaching.
* The ''anagogical'' interpretation includes consummation of the world.

Roman Catholic theology adds other rules of interpretation that include:

* the injunction that all other senses of sacred scripture are based on the ''literal'';<ref>Thomas Aquinas[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm "Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses"]; cf. ''Catechism of the Catholic Church,'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III §116]</ref>

* that the historicity of the Gospels must be absolutely and constantly held;<ref>Second Vatican Council [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html ''Dei Verbum'' (V.19)]</ref>

* that scripture must be read within the "living Tradition of the whole Church";<ref> ''Catechism of the Catholic Church,'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III "The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture" § 113]</ref> and

* that "the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the Bishop of Rome".<ref>''Catechism of the Catholic Church,'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm#III "The Interpretation of the Heritage of Faith" § 85]</ref>

===== Protestant =====

Many Protestant Christians believe that the Bible is a self-sufficient revelation, the final authority on all Christian doctrine, and contains all revealed truth necessary for salvation. This concept is known as Sola scriptura.<ref>Keith Mathison ''The Shape of Sola Scriptura'' (2001)</ref> Many Protestants stress the literal sense or historical-grammatical method,<ref>R.C. Sproul, ''Knowing Scripture'', p. 45-61; Greg Bahnsen, [http://www.cmfnow.com/articles/pt173.htm ''A Reformed Confession Regarding Hermeneutics'' (art. 6)]</ref> some even to the extent of rejecting other senses altogether. Other Protestant interpreters make use of typology.<ref>E.g., in his [http://eword.gospelcom.net/comments/matthew/mh/matthew1.htm commentary on Matthew 1] (§III.3) Matthew Henry interprets the twin-sons of Judah, Phares and Zara, as an allegory of the Gentile and Jewish Christians. For a contemporary treatment, see W. Edward Glenny, [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_typology_glenny.html ''Typology: A Summary Of The Present Evangelical Discussion'']</ref> Protestants characteristically believe that ordinary believers may reach an adequate understanding of Scripture because Scripture itself is clear (or "perspicuous"), because of the help of the Holy Spirit, or both. Martin Luther believed that without God's help Scripture would be "enveloped in darkness."<ref name="Foutz" /> He advocated "one definite and simple understanding of Scripture."<ref name="Foutz">Scott Foutz, [http://www.quodlibet.net/luther.shtml '' Martin Luther and Scripture'']</ref> John Calvin wrote, "all who...follow the Holy Spirit as their guide, find in the Scripture a clear light."<ref>John Calvin, [http://www.ccel.org/c/calvin/comment3/comm_vol45/htm/vii.iv.iv.htm '' Commentaries on the Catholic Epistles'' 2 Peter 3:14-18]</ref> The Second Helvetic (Latin for "Swiss")<ref>http://mb-soft.com/believe/txh/helvconf.htm Article about Helvetic confessions</ref> Confession, composed by the pastor of the Reformed church in Zurich (successor to Protestant reformer Zwingli) was adopted as a declaration of doctrine by most European Reformed churches.<ref>Second Helvetic Confession, [http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c02.htm ''Of Interpreting the Holy Scriptures; and of Fathers, Councils, and Traditions'']</ref> The ''Confession'' contains this statement about interpreting Scripture:

=== Creeds ===

Creeds (from Latin ''credo'' meaning "I believe") are concise doctrinal statements or confessions, usually of religious beliefs. They began as baptismal formulas and were later expanded during the Christological controversies of the fourth and fifth centuries to become statements of faith.

The Apostles Creed (''Symbolum Apostolorum'') was developed between the second and ninth centuries. It is the most popular creed used in worship by Western Christians. Its central doctrines are those of the Trinity and God the Creator. Each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the apostolic period. The creed was apparently used as a summary of Christian doctrine for baptismal candidates in the churches of Rome.<ref>Jaroslav Pelikan and Valerie Hotchkiss, editors.

== Worship ==

Emperor Antoninus Pius, and his description remains relevant to the basic structure of Christian liturgical worship:

200px|left|thumb|Samples of Christian religious objects- The [[Bible|Holy Bible, a Crucifix, and a Rosary.]]

: "And on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying Amen; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need."<ref name=justin>Justin Martyr, [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html ''First Apology''] §LXVII</ref>

Thus, as Justin described, Christians assemble for communal worship on Old and Lord's Supper) is the part of liturgical worship that consists of a consecrated meal, usually bread and wine. Justin Martyr described the Eucharist:

Some Christian denominations view communion as indicating those who are already united in the church, restricting participation to their members not in a state of mortal sin (closed communion). Most other churches view communion as a means to unity, rather than an end, and invite all Christians or even anyone to participate (open communion). In some denominations, participation is decided by prior arrangement with a church leader.

Some groups depart from this traditional liturgical structure. A division is often made between "High" Low" services, but even within these two categories there is great diversity in forms of worship. Seventh-day Adventists meet on Sabbath), while others do not meet on a weekly basis. Charismatic or Quakers sit quietly until moved by the Holy Spirit to speak. Some Evangelical services resemble concerts with rock and pop music, dancing, and use of multimedia. For groups which do not recognize a priesthood distinct from ordinary believers the services are generally lead by a minister, preacher, or pastor. Still others may lack any formal leaders, either in principle or by local necessity. Some churches use only a cappella music, either on principle (e.g. many Churches of Christ object to the use of instruments in worship) or by tradition (as in Orthodoxy).

Worship can be varied for special events like feast days. In the early church Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called Sabbath school (Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services).

=== Sacraments ===

right|thumb|200px|The [[Eucharist]]
In grace, constituting a sacred mystery. The term is derived from the Latin word ''sacramentum'', which was used to translate the Greek word for ''mystery''.<ref name="ODCC1435"></ref> Views concerning both what rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament vary among Christian denominations and traditions.<ref name="ODCC1435" />

The most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are Confirmation (Orthodox tradition), and the Reconciliation of a Penitent (confession), Matrimony.<ref name="ODCC1435" /> Taken together, these are the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Independent Catholic, Anglicans. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology.<ref name="ODCC1435" /> Some ordinances''.

=== Liturgical calendar ===

Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians, and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around a liturgical calendar. This includes holy days, such as solemnities which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus or the saints, periods of fasting such as Lent, and other pious events such as memoria or lesser festivals commemorating saints. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as Christmas, Easter and Pentecost. A few churches make no use of a liturgical calendar.<ref>Hickman, Hoyt L., et al. ''Handbook of the Christian Year''. Abingdon Press (1986). ISBN 0-687-16575-X</ref>

=== Symbols ===

The cross, which is today one of the most widely recognised symbols in the world, was used as a Christian symbol from the earliest times.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm ANF04.

Among the symbols employed by the primitive Christians, that of the fish seems to have ranked first in importance. From monumental sources such as tombs it is known that the symbolic fish was familiar to Christians from the earliest times. The fish was depicted as a Christian symbol in the first decades of the second century.<ref name="cefish"></ref> Its popularity among Christians was due principally, it would seem, to the famous acrostic consisting of the initial letters of five Greek words forming the word for fish (Ichthys), which words briefly but clearly described the character of Christ and the claim to worship of believers: ''Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter'', meaning, ''Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour''.<ref name="cefish" />

Christians from the very beginning adorned their tombs with paintings of Christ, of the saints, of scenes from the chi-rho monogram, the dove (symbolic of the Holy Spirit), the sacrificial lamb (symbolic of Christ's sacrifice), the vine (symbolising the necessary connectedness of the Christian with Christ) and many others. These all derive from writings found in the New Testament.<ref name="soc" />

== History and origins ==

thumb|right|[[Martyrdom of St. Ignatius, bishop of Antioch appointed by St. Peter.]]

===Early Church and Christological Councils ===

The Christian Church traces its history to Jesus and the Twelve Apostles, and saw the early bishops of the Church as the successors of the Apostles in general. Central to the doctrines of the Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican Churches is Apostolic Succession, the belief that the bishops are the spiritual successors of the original twelve apostles, through the historically unbroken chain of consecration. 

From the beginning, Christians were subject to various persecutions. This involved even death for Christians such as Roman historian Peter and Paul were each martyred in persecutions of the Church occurred under nine subsequent Roman emperors including Domitian, Decius and Diocletian. From the year 150, Christian teachers began to produce theological and "apologetic" works aimed at defending the faith. These authors are known as the Church Fathers, and study of them is called Patristics. Notable early Fathers include Ignatius of Antioch, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria and Origen.

Christianity was legalized in the fourth century, when Arian heresy and formulated the Nicene Creed, which is still used by the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglican Communion, and many Protestant churches.<ref name="UMC - Our Common Heritage as Christians" /> 

On 27 February 380, Emperor Theodosius I enacted a law establishing Catholic Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire.<ref>"It is our desire that all the various nations which are subject to our clemency and moderation should continue to the profession of that religion which was delivered to the Romans by the divine Apostle Peter, as it has been preserved by faithful tradition and which is now professed by the Pontiff Damasus and by Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, a man of apostolic holiness. ... We authorize the followers of this law to assume the title Catholic Christians; but as for the others, since in our judgment they are foolish madmen, we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious name of heretics, and shall not presume to give their conventicles the name of churches."
</ref>  This period of history was also marked by the inauguration of a series of Ecumenical (worldwide) Christological Councils which established and formally codified critical elements of the theology of the Church. In 382, the Council of Rome set the Canon of the Bible, listing the accepted books of the Old Testament and the New Testament. Also, the Council of Ephesus in 431 declared that Jesus existed both as fully man and fully God simultaneously, clarifying his status in the Trinity. The meaning of the Nicene Creed was also declared a permanent doctrine of the Church.

====High Middle Ages====
In the west, from the 11th century onward, older cathedral schools developed into universities (see University of Paris, University of Oxford, and University of Bologna.) Originally teaching only theology, these steadily added subjects including medicine, philosophy and law, becoming the direct ancestors of modern western institutions of learning.<ref>Gonzalez, Justo L.

====East-West Schism====

Over a period stretching from the seventh to the fourteenth centuries, the Christian Church underwent a gradual schism that divided it into a Western (Latin) branch, now known as the Roman Catholic Church, and an Eastern (Greek) branch, which has become known as the Orthodox Church. These two churches disagree on a number of administrative, liturgical, and doctrinal issues, most notably papal primacy of jurisdiction.<ref name="Orthodox Information Centre-Great Schism"></ref>

The Second Council of Lyon (1274) and the Council of Florence (1439) attempted to reunite the churches, but in both cases the Orthodox refused to ratify the decisions and the two principal churches remain in schism to the present day.
