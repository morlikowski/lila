'''The Chieftains''' are a Irish musical group founded in 1963, best known for being the first band to make Irish traditional music popular around the world.

The band's name came from the book ''Death of a Chieftain'' by Irish author John Montague.<ref>[http://members.shaw.ca/chieftains/history.html the Chieftains - A Musical History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The word ''chieftain'' itself derives from the English language translation of the Irish Gaelic word ''taoiseach'', meaning a clan chief or leader. Some historians suggest that in ancient Ireland (whence these terms originate), a taoiseach was a minor king. Assisted early on by Garech Browne, they signed with his company Claddagh Records. They needed financial success abroad, and succeeded in this, as within a few years their third album's sleeve note section was printed in three languages. 

The band has recorded many albums of instrumental Irish folk music, as well as multiple collaborations with popular musicians of many genres, including Cape Breton and Newfoundland music, and Tom Jones, Sting, Rosanne Cash, Jim White, Tom Partington, Ziggy Marley, Lyle Lovett, Jackson Browne, and numerous Country-western artists.  In May 1986 they performed at Self Aid, a benefit concert held in Dublin that focused on the problem of chronic unemployment which was widespread in Ireland at that time. In 1994 they appeared in Roger Daltrey's production, album and video of ''A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who''.

The group have won six Emmy and a Genie and contributed a couple of tracks, including their highly-praised version of the song ''Oscar-winning score for Lifetime Achievement Award'' by the UK's BBC Radio 2. Two of their singles have been minor hits. ''Have I Told You Lately''  (credited to The Chieftains with Van Morrison) reached number 71 in 1995. ''I Know My Love'' (credited to The Chieftains featuring The Corrs) reached number 37 in 2002.

The front covers of the first four albums were designed by Edward Delaney.

==Band members==
Paddy Moloney is the band's leader, and composes or arranges most of the band's music. While the band's members changed numerous times in the band's early history, the membership solidified in 1979 when Matt Molloy replaced Michael Tubridy. From then until 2002, members included:

* Paddy Moloney (uilleann pipes, tin whistle, button accordion, bodhrán)
* Matt Molloy (flute, tin whistle)
* Kevin Conneff (bodhrán, vocals)
* Seán Keane (fiddle, tin whistle)
* bones)
* Derek Bell (Irish harp, keyboard instruments, oboe)

In 2002, Fay retired from active membership and Bell died.
