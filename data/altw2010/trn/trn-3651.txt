'''''Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes''''' is a triple live album by The Velvet Underground. It was released on October 16, 2001 by Polydor, the record label overseeing The Velvet Underground's Universal Music Group back catalogue. 

''The Quine Tapes'' is currently the first and only release in the proposed Bootleg Series. It was originally recorded live by new wave guitarist to play with musicians such as Richard Hell and Lou Reed.

==The Quine Tapes==
During 1969, The Velvet Underground toured the mono audience recordings, as with this set and the 1972 live album ''stereo soundboard recordings).

Robert Quine, an avid Velvet Underground fan, used to travel to as many V.U. gigs as possible. He became friends with the band and they allowed him to record sets from the audience, occasionally asking for playbacks. Quine recorded many concerts, but as his original reels of what he considered the best material. These "best-of" reels were ultimately released in 2001 as the present ''The Quine Tapes'' set. The original musicassettes from which the reels were compiled no longer exist.

Musically, ''The Quine Tapes'' find the band in top form during the same phase in their history as documented on ''1969'' – the two sets even share a performance of "Rock and Roll", recorded at the same concert by both Quine and the Matrix sound personnel. Quine's tapes, although lo-fi audience recordings, capture much more of the music's ambience, especially in the larger venues, such as Washington University in St. Louis, where the band could let loose and roar. Additionally, ''The Quine Tapes'' contains songs that the band only rarely performed by this time, such as "Sunday Morning", "Venus in Furs" and "The Black Angel's Death Song", along with other obscurities such as "Over You", "Ride Into the Sun", and "Follow the Leader", which had never even been bootlegged in its original form.

'''Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes''' est le quatrième album live du Velvet Underground. Il s'agit d'un triple album enregistré, tout comme l'album 1969: The Velvet Underground Live, lors de la tournée du groupe en 1969 à travers l'Amérique du Nord.

A l'époque, un fan répondant au nom de Robert Quine suit le groupe où qu'il aille, pour assister à autant de concerts que possible. Il devient finalement ami avec les musiciens, qui lui donnent l'autorisation d'enregistrer les performances. Ces "Quine Tapes", finalement publiées en 2001, sont en fait un "best-of" de ces enregistrements captés avec très peu de moyens.

Entre temps, Robert Quine est devenu un guitariste reconnu, jouant notamment pour le groupe punk The Voidoids et Lou Reed. Les bandes originales des concerts, elles, ont disparues depuis longtemps.
