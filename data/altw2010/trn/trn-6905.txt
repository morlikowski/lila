'''Zebra''' é uma brasileiro para designar um resultado inesperado, como, por exemplo, a vitória de uma equipe fraca sobre outra considerada superior.
A origem do nome vem do jogo do bicho, que não tem zebra entre os 25 animais. Ou se seja, a zebra era impossível de ser dada.

Quando uma equipe favorita perde o jogo, dizemos que foi "zebra" ou que "deu zebra".
