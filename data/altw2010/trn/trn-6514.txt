'''Flash Gordon''' is a 1980 album by English rock band Queen. It is the movie ''Flash Gordon''.

All but two of the tracks on the album ("Flash's Theme" and "The Hero") are instrumentals. The album makes extensive use of synthesizers, which Queen had employed for the first time on their previous album, 'The Game'.

"Flash's Theme" was the only single to be released from the album, under the title "Flash". It reached number 10 in the UK charts and number 42 in the US. The track is notable for its pounding, repetitive bassline and the camp humour of the snippets of dialogue from the movie that it contains.
The last track, "The Hero", while an individual song, reprises the main motif from "Flash's Theme".

The tracks featured here contain dialogue from the film. A "music only" version, free of the dialogue snippets, has been rumored for years.
