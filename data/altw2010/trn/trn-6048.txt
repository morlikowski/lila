'''Andy Taylor''' (born English The Power Station.   He has also performed as a solo artist, and served as a record producer for several other artists.

He was born and raised in Cullercoats, Tyne and Wear, North East England, and attended Marden High School. He began playing guitar at the age of eleven, and was soon playing with local bands, even producing one at the age of sixteen.  He dropped out of school early to tour England and Europe with several different bands, playing working men's clubs and air force bases.

==Duran Duran and Power Station==
Taylor joined Duran Duran in 1980 (easily the most experienced musician in the band), and enjoyed their rise to fame over the next five years.   He married Tracey Wilson, one of Duran Duran's hairstylists, in 1982.  The couple have four children.  Taylor invested his royalties in real estate, and once owned a wine bar in Whitley Bay named "Rio" after one of Duran Duran's biggest hit singles.

In the mid eighties Taylor grew dissatisfied with the band's keyboard-heavy John Taylor, Chic drummer Robert Palmer to create the band The Power Station, which had three hit singles and played the Live Aid concert in 1985.  The band was a distinct break from the New Romantic Duran Duran material as they pursued a hard-rock music style. 

Taylor would later rejoin Power Station bandmates Palmer and Thompson for Palmer's first solo album since the band's formation. The resulting album, ''Riptide'' proved to be a massive success for Palmer.

After The Power Station, Taylor allowed Duran Duran to believe he would be returning to record a new album, even as he was signing contracts for a solo career in Los Angeles. Another Capitol Records group, Notorious'', but he ended up playing on only a few tracks before departing the band completely.  He later countersued to claim some of the royalties from that album.

==Solo career==
In the meantime, Andy Taylor hooked up with ex-Steve Jones and recorded the hit single "Take It Easy" (US #24), which was used as the theme song to the movie ''Thunder'' (1987).  O'Hearn again played bass for him on the album and during the following tour. 

Taylor also contributed a cover of "Dead on the Money" to the ''Tequila Sunrise'' soundtrack in 1988.  Taylor's former band Duran Duran would also allow one of their own songs, "Do You Believe In Shame?" to be included on the album.  

A second solo album, this one consisting of entirely Dangerous'', was released in 1990.

Taylor played as a backing musician for several other stars, including Robert Palmer, Thunder. He then moved on to producing full time, working with several moderately successful bands throughout the 1990s.

His most recent venture is the album "Burger Kingdom" which was recorded at his Ibiza studio in April 2008. 

His new band consists of the following members: 

Andy Taylor - Guitar & Vocal

Liam Keenan - Vocals & Piano

Joe Breban - Drums

Miky Dunn - Bass

==Reunions==
Taylor participated in the Astronaut'', featured a blend of Taylor's heavy guitar with the synth hooks of the classic Duran Duran sound.

Nato e cresciuto a Cullercoats, nel Tyne and Wear, frequentò la Marden High School. Iniziò a suonare la chitarra all'età di undici anni cimentandosi subito con gruppi locali e diventando persino produttore di uno di questi all'età di sedici anni. Abbandonò presto gli studi per girare l'Inghilterra e l'Europa con diversi gruppi, esibendosi in piccoli locali e basi aeree militari.

==Duran Duran e Power Station==

Taylor si unì ai Duran Duran nel 1980, essendo di gran lunga il musicista del gruppo con più esperienza, e partecipò al rapido raggiungimento della fama nei cinque anni successivi. Nel 1982 sposò Tracey Wilson, una delle parrucchiere del gruppo e la coppia ebbe quattro figli. Taylor investì i diritti nel mercato immobiliare e aprì anche un wine bar a Whitley Bay che chiamò ''Rio'' come uno dei singoli dei Duran Duran di maggior successo.

In seguito, però, Taylor divenne progressivamente sempre più scontento del suono tastiere e sintetizzatori. Sentendo l'esigenza di dedicarsi ad un suono più bassista John Taylor,  al Chic Tony Thompson, ad al cantante Robert Palmer per creare il gruppo The Power Station che registrò tre singoli di successo e suonò al Live Aid nel 1985. Il gruppo segnò un netto distacco dallo stile New Romantic dei Duran Duran rivolgendosi verso forme più vicine all'hard rock.

In July 1986, Roger Taylor and Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran) released "The Flame", the final single from ''So Red The Rose''.  The accompanying music video featured a cameo by John Taylor coming out of a closet with a contract to sign. Fans have debated whether this was a thinly veiled dig at the situation with Andy at the time.
