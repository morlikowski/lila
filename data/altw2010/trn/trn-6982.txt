'''Benazir Bhutto''' (Sindhi: بينظير ڀٽو, Urdu: بینظیر بھٹو, ) (political party in Pakistan. Bhutto was the first woman elected to lead a Muslim state,<ref>"Benazir Bhutto: Daughter of Tragedy" by Muhammad Najeeb, Hasan Zaidi, Saurabh Shulka and S.

Bhutto was the eldest child of former prime minister Sindhi descent (Shia Muslim by faith, and Iranian-Kurdish descent, similarly Shia Muslim by faith. Her paternal grandfather was Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, who came to Larkana District in Sindh before the independence from his native town of Bhatto Kalan, which is situated in the Indian state of Haryana.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Bhutto was sworn in as Prime Minister for the first time in 1988 at the age of 35, but was removed from office 20 months later under the order of then-president Ghulam Ishaq Khan on grounds of alleged corruption. In 1993 she was re-elected but was again removed in 1996 on similar charges, this time by President Farooq Leghari. She went into self-imposed exile in Dubai in 1998.

Bhutto returned to Pakistan on assassinated on Pakistani general election of 2008 where she was a leading opposition candidate.

==Education and personal life==
Benazir Bhutto was born in Begum Nusrat Ispahani and Convent of Jesus and Mary in Karachi.<ref></ref> After two years of schooling at the Rawalpindi Presentation Convent, she was sent to the Jesus and Mary Convent at O-level examinations at the age of 15.<ref name=br></ref> She then went on to complete her A-Levels at the Karachi Grammar School.

After completing her early education in Pakistan, she pursued her higher education in the Bachelor of Arts degree with ''cum laude'' honors comparative government.<ref>[http://womenshistory.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ/Ya&sdn=womenshistory&cdn=education&tm=12&f=00&tt=14&bt=1&bts=1&zu=http%3A//www.britannica.com/eb/article%3Feu%3D81217 Encyclopædia Britannica entry] via about.com</ref> She was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa.<ref name=br /> Bhutto would later call her time at Harvard "four of the happiest years of my life" and said it formed "the very basis of her belief in democracy". Later in 1995 as Prime Minister, she would arrange a gift from the Pakistani government to Harvard Law School.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2007/12/28/classmates_at_harvard_recall_a_shy_girl_pinkie/ Classmates at Harvard recall a shy girl, 'Pinkie'] December 28, 2007</ref>

On Bilawal, Bakhtwar and Aseefa.

==Family==
Benazir Bhutto's father, former Prime Minister chief of army General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, who imposed martial law but promised to hold elections within three months. Nevertheless, instead of fulfilling the promise of holding general elections, General Zia charged Mr. Bhutto with conspiring to murder the father of dissident politician Ahmed Raza Kasuri. Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was sentenced to death by the martial law court.

Despite the accusation being "widely doubted by the public",<ref name=NYTdepose>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE2D61238F936A35752C1A960958260 Pakistan's Premier Bhutto was Put Under House Arrest], ''New York Times'', November 5, 1996, by John F. Burns</ref> and many clemency appeals from foreign leaders, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged on April 4, 1979. Appeals for clemency were dismissed by acting President General Zia. Benazir Bhutto and her mother were held in a "police camp" until the end of May, after the execution.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E14FF3E5D12728DDDA00A94DD405B898BF1D3 Pakistan Frees Widow And Daughter of Bhutto], ''New York Times'', May 29, 1979</ref>

In 1985, Benazir Bhutto's brother Shahnawaz was killed under suspicious circumstances in France. Later in 1996 the killing of her other brother, Mir Murtaza, contributed to destabilizing her second term as Prime Minister.

Bhutto, who had returned to Pakistan after completing her studies, found herself placed under house arrest in the wake of her father's imprisonment and subsequent execution. Having been allowed in 1984 to return to the United Kingdom, she became a leader in exile of the PPP, her father's party, though she was unable to make her political presence felt in Pakistan until after the death of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. She had succeeded her mother as leader of the PPP and the pro-democracy opposition to the Zia-ul-Haq regime.

On National Assembly. Bhutto was sworn in as Prime Minister of a leader of the opposition while Sharif served as Prime Minister for the next three years.

Elections were held again in October 1993 and her PPP coalition was victorious, returning Bhutto to office and allowing her to continue her reform initiatives. According to journalist Shyam Bhatia, Bhutto smuggled CDs containing uranium enrichment data to corruption scandals Bhutto was dismissed by then-president Farooq Leghari, who used the Eighth Amendment discretionary powers to dissolve the government. The Supreme Court affirmed President Leghari's dismissal in a 6-1 ruling.<ref></ref>
Criticism against Bhutto came from the Punjabi elites and powerful landlord families who opposed Bhutto. She blamed this opposition for the destabilization of Pakistan. Irshad Manji judged her attempts to modernize Pakistan a failure.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/12/29/pakistan.commentary/index.html Commentary: Bhutto failed to modernize Pakistan] Irshad Manji, December 29, 2007</ref> Musharraf
characterized Bhutto's terms as an "era of sham democracy" and others characterized her terms a period of corrupt, failed governments.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/13/AR2008011303447.html Many Pakistanis See Leader As Having Reigned Too Long] January 14, 2008</ref>

===Policies for women===
During the election campaigns the Bhutto government voiced its concern for women's social and health issues, including the issue of discrimination against women. Bhutto announced plans to establish women's police stations, courts, and women's development banks. Despite these plans, Bhutto did not propose any legislation to improve welfare services for women. During her election campaigns, she promised to repeal controversial laws (such as Hudood and Zina ordinances) that curtail the rights of women in Pakistan, but the party did not fulfill these promises during her tenures as Prime Minister, due to immense pressure from the opposition. Bhutto was pro-life and spoke forcefully against abortion, most notably at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, where she accused the West of "seeking to impose adultery, abortion, intercourse education and other such matters on individuals, societies and religions which have their own social ethos."<ref>Turner, Brian S. (2003) ''[http://books.google.ca/books?id=zOAo9VvT4FEC Islam: Critical Concepts in Sociology]'' (pp. 118) Routledge</ref>

After Bhutto's stints as Prime Minister, during General Musharraf's regime, her party did initiate legislation to repeal the Zina ordinance. These efforts were defeated by the right-wing religious parties that dominated the legislatures at the time.

Bhutto was an active and founding member of the Council of Women World Leaders, a network of current and former prime ministers and presidents.

===Policy on Taliban===
The Taliban took power in Central Asian republics, according to author U.S. 2004</ref> He claims that like the United States, her government provided military and financial support for the Taliban, even sending a small unit of the Pakistani army into Afghanistan.

More recently, she took an anti-Taliban stance, and condemned terrorist acts allegedly committed by the Taliban and their supporters.

==Charges of corruption==
French, Polish, Spanish, and Swiss documents have fueled the charges of corruption against Bhutto and her husband. They faced a number of legal proceedings, including a charge of laundering money through Swiss banks. Though never convicted, her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, spent eight years in prison on similar corruption charges. After being released on bail in 2004, Zardari suggested that his time in prison involved torture; human rights groups have supported his claim that his rights were violated.<ref></ref>

A 1998 ''New York Times'' investigative report<ref name=jld1>[http://www.samsloan.com/benazir.htm Bhutto Clan Leaves Trail of Corruption in Pakistan], by John F. Burns, ''The New York Times'', 1998-01-09</ref> claims that Pakistani investigators have documents that uncover a network of bank accounts, all linked to the family's lawyer in Switzerland, with Asif Zardari as the principal shareholder. According to the article, documents released by the French authorities indicated that Zardari offered exclusive rights to fighter jets in exchange for a 5% commission to be paid to a Swiss corporation controlled by Zardari. The article also said a Dubai company received an exclusive license to import gold into Pakistan for which Asif Zardari received payments of more than $10 million into his Dubai-based Citibank accounts. The owner of the company denied that he had made payments to Zardari and claims the documents were forged.

Bhutto maintained that the charges levelled against her and her husband were purely political.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E4D6143FF932A25756C0A96F958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fZ%2fZardari%2c%20Asif%20Ali Bhutto's Husband Appeals] May 11, 1999</ref><ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E1DF1231F933A05751C1A961958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fZ%2fZardari%2c%20Asif%20Ali World News Briefs; Bhutto's Jailed Husband Sworn In as Senator] December 30, 1997</ref> An Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) report supports Bhutto's claim. It presents information suggesting that Benazir Bhutto was ousted from power in 1990 as a result of a witch hunt approved by then-president Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The AGP report says Khan illegally paid legal advisers 28 million rupees to file 19 corruption cases against Bhutto and her husband in 1990-92.<ref></ref>

Yet the assets held by Bhutto and her husband continue to be scrutinized and speculated about. The prosecutors have alleged that their Swiss bank accounts contain £740 million.<ref name=jld2>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2652808.ece Corruption amnesty may release millions for Bhutto], The Sunday Times, 2007-10-14</ref> Zardari also bought a neo-Tudor mansion and estate worth over £4 million in Surrey, England, UK.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/823259.cms Asif Zardari lays claim to 4-mn-pound UK estate], The Times of India, 2004-08-22</ref><ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article393637.ece £4&nbsp;m Surrey mansion in Bhutto 'corruption' row], The Sunday Times, 2004-11-21</ref> The Pakistani investigations have tied other overseas properties to Zardari's family. These include a $2.5 million manor in Normandy owned by Zardari's parents, who had modest assets at the time of his marriage.<ref name=jld1/> Bhutto denied holding substantive overseas assets.

===Switzerland===
On July 23, 1998, the Swiss Government handed over documents to the government of Pakistan which relate to corruption allegations against Benazir Bhutto and her husband.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/136259.stm South Asia Bhutto 'corruption' documents reach Pakistan], Thursday, 23 July 1998</ref> The documents included a formal charge of money laundering by Swiss authorities against Zardari. The Pakistani government had been conducting a wide-ranging inquiry to account for more than $13.7 million frozen by Swiss authorities in 1997 that was allegedly stashed in banks by Bhutto and her husband. The Pakistani government recently filed criminal charges against Bhutto in an effort to track down an estimated $1.5 billion she and her husband are alleged to have received in a variety of criminal enterprises.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0716FB39590C738EDDA10894D0494D81&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss Swiss Want Bhutto Indicted in Pakistan for Money Laundering], August 20, 1998, Thursday, by Elizabeth Olson</ref> The documents suggest that the money Zardari was alleged to have laundered was accessible to Benazir Bhutto and had been used to buy a diamond necklace for over $175,000.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0716FB39590C738EDDA10894D0494D81&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss Swiss Want Bhutto Indicted in Pakistan for Money Laundering], August 20, 1998, Thursday, by Elizabeth Olson</ref> The PPP has responded by flatly denying the charges, suggesting that Swiss authorities have been misled by false evidence provided by the Government of Pakistan.

On August 6, 2003, Swiss magistrates found Bhutto and her husband guilty of money laundering.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1D61F3EF935A3575BC0A9659C8B63&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss Asia: Pakistan: Bhutto Sentenced In Switzerland] August 6, 2003</ref> They were given six-month suspended jail terms, fined $50,000 each and were ordered to pay $11 million to the Pakistani government. The six-year trial concluded that Bhutto and Zardari deposited in Swiss accounts $10 million given to them by a Swiss company in exchange for a contract in Pakistan. The couple said they would appeal. The Pakistani investigators say Zardari opened a Citibank account in Geneva in 1995 through which they say he passed some $40 million of the $100 million he received in payoffs from foreign companies doing business in Pakistan.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A13F735540C7A8CDDA80894D0494D81&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss THE BHUTTO MILLIONS; A Background Check Far From Ordinary], 9 January 1998, Friday, By JOHN F. BURNS (NYT)</ref> In October 2007, Daniel Zappelli, chief prosecutor of the canton of Geneva, said he received the conclusions of a money laundering investigation against former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on October 29, but it was unclear whether there would be any further legal action against her in Switzerland.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/29/europe/EU-GEN-Switzerland-Pakistan-Corruption.php Swiss prosecutor gets case against Bhutto], 29 October 2007, Monday, by The Associated Press</ref>

===Poland===
The Polish Government has given Pakistan 500 pages of documentation relating to corruption allegations against Benazir Bhutto and her husband. These charges are in regard to the purchase of 8,000 tractors in a 1997 deal.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article393637.ece £4&nbsp;m Surrey mansion in Bhutto 'corruption' row] Ursus tractors.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/2004/07/23/top8.htm NAB says Swiss order names Benazir: Ursus tractor case] July 22, 2004</ref>

===France===
Potentially the most lucrative deal alleged in the documents involved the effort by Dassault Aviation, a French military contractor. French authorities indicated in 1998 that Bhutto's husband, Zardari, offered exclusive rights to Dassault to replace the air force's fighter jets in exchange for a five percent commission to be paid to a corporation in Switzerland controlled by Zardari.<ref></ref>

At the time, French corruption laws forbade bribery of French officials but permitted payoffs to foreign officials, and even made the payoffs tax-deductible in France. However, France changed this law in 2000.<ref></ref>

===Helicopter Scandal===

In 1998-1999 An enquiry was conducted by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Parliament to investigate the matter regarding the purchase of the helicopter. The case involves defrauding substantive sum of $2.168 million and $1.1 million public money. The record shows that the case was not pursued properly and diligently. FIR No 1 of 1998 was registered with Federal Investigation Agency State Bank Circle Rawalpindi on the complaint of Cabinet Division.  Thorough investigation was conducted by the committee headed by Chaudhry Muhammad Barjees Tahir and two other members, namely Faridullah Jamali and Jamshaid Ali Shah. During this investigation the committee Chairman '''Barjees Tahir''' summoned both the former President Farooq Leghari and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto along with others, and they were investigated. The case received extensive media coverage both inside and outside Pakistan. The recommendations of the committee, obtained from the file, are as under:

'''6.1:''' FIR may be lodged against (1) Malik Allah Yar Khan of Kalabagh (2) Zia Pervez Hussain (3) Dr M.A. Khan and criminal proceedings be instituted against them defrauding the government.

'''6.2:''' The amount of $2.168 million be recovered from Malik Allah Yar Khan, Zia Pervez Hussain and Dr M.A. Khan by attaching their properties etc in Pakistan or abroad for this purpose. FIA may be directed to take steps to recover this money through Interpol, if necessary. Any banker or foreign national involved in this fraud may also be taken to task by the Federal Investigation Agency.

'''6.3:''' As Benazir Bhutto, she is clearly responsible for this loss to exchequer as major decisions in respect of this contract were taken with her approval or direction and passed on to Cabinet Division through former PS PM (Ahmad Sadiq). FIR may be registered against her for causing loss to state by misuse of her authority as PM, and criminal proceedings be initiated.

'''6.4:''' Farooq Leghari knows that his name has visibly come up in this case. He has tried to plead innocent. It is unimaginable that those operating in this scandal could have easy access to the top bureaucrats like Cabinet Secretary, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister and even to the Prime Minister herself without the backing and active support of the President. FIR against him must also be registered and criminal proceedings initiated.

'''6.5:''' As for the senior civil servants involved in the case, Ahmad Sadiq former PS PM, Humayun Faiz Rasul and Sahibzada Imtiaz former Cabinet Secretary, no action can be taken against them at this stage as they already stand retired/superannuated.

The case was further referred to the National Accountability Bureau in 2000-02 but no action was taken.

===Western Asia===
In the largest single payment investigators have uncovered, a gold bullion dealer in Western Asia was alleged to have deposited at least $10 million into one of Zardari's accounts after the Bhutto government gave him a monopoly on gold imports that sustained Pakistan's jewellery industry. The money was allegedly deposited into Zardari's Citibank account in Dubai. Pakistan's Arabian Sea coast, stretching from Karachi to the border with Iran, has long been a gold smugglers' haven. Until the beginning of Bhutto's second term, the trade, running into hundreds of millions of dollars a year, was unregulated, with slivers of gold called biscuits, and larger weights in bullion, carried on planes and boats that travel between the Persian Gulf and the largely unguarded Pakistani coast.

Shortly after Bhutto returned as prime minister in 1993, a Pakistani bullion trader in Dubai, Abdul Razzak Yaqub, proposed a deal: in return for the exclusive right to import gold, Razzak would help the government regularize the trade. In November 1994, Pakistan's Commerce Ministry wrote to Razzak informing him that he had been granted a license that made him, for at least the next two years, Pakistan's sole authorized gold importer. In an interview in his office in Dubai, Razzak acknowledged that he had used the license to import more than $500 million in gold into Pakistan, and that he had travelled to Islamabad several times to meet with Bhutto and Zardari. But he denied that there had been any corruption or secret deals. "I have not paid a single cent to Zardari," he said. Razzak claims that someone in Pakistan who wished to destroy his reputation had contrived to have his company wrongly identified as the depositor. "Somebody in the bank has cooperated with my enemies to make false documents," he said.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE5D91F30F93AA35752C0A96E958260 House of Graft: Tracing the Bhutto Millions -- A special report.; Bhutto Clan Leaves Trail of Corruption] January 9, 1998</ref><ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/kampmark12282007.html Bhutto and Her Legacy: Death in Rawalpindi] December 28, 2007</ref><ref>The Gold Connection, New York Times, 1998</ref><ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19980414/10450284.html Graft charges against Benazir lead to UK] April 14, 1998</ref>

Nonetheless, by mid-2007, the US appeared to be pushing for a deal in which Musharraf would remain as president but step down as military head, and either Bhutto or one of her nominees would become prime minister.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister and opposition leader expected by many to return from exile and join Musharraf in a power-sharing deal after year-end general elections, praised him for taking a tough line on the Red Mosque.

I'm glad there was no cease-fire with the militants in the mosque because cease-fires simply embolden the militants," she told Britain's Sky TV on Tuesday. "There will be a backlash, but at some time we have to stop appeasing the militants."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-6773175,00.html Mosque Crisis May Boost Musharraf's Hand] July 11, 2007</ref></blockquote>

This remark about the Red Mosque was seen with dismay in Pakistan as reportedly hundreds of young students were burned to death and remains are untraceable and cases are being heard in Pakistani supreme court as a missing persons issue. This and subsequent support for Musharaf led Elder Bhutto's comrades like Khar to criticize her publicly.

Bhutto however advised Musharraf in an early phase of the latter's quarrel with the Chief Justice, to restore him. Her PPP did not capitalize on its CEC member, Aitzaz Ahsan, the chief Barrister for the Chief Justice, in successful restoration. Rather he was seen as a rival and was isolated.

The Bhutto-led PPP secured the highest number of votes (28.42%) and eighty seats (23.16%) in the national assembly in the October 2002 general elections.<ref></ref> Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) managed to win eighteen seats only. Some of the elected candidates of PPP formed a faction of their own, calling it PPP-Patriots which was being led by Makhdoom Faisal Saleh Hayat, the former leader of Bhutto-led PPP. They later formed a coalition government with Musharraf's party, PML-Q.

===Possible deal with the Musharraf Government===
In mid-2002 Musharraf implemented a two-term limit on Prime Ministers. Both Bhutto and Musharraf's other chief rival, Nawaz Sharif, have already served two terms as Prime Minister.<ref></ref> Musharraf's allies in parliament, especially the PMLQ, are unlikely to reverse the changes to allow Prime Ministers to seek third terms, nor to make particular exceptions for either Bhutto or Sharif.

In July 2007, some of Bhutto's frozen funds were released.<ref></ref> Bhutto continued to face significant charges of corruption. In an 8 August 2007 interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Bhutto revealed the meeting focused on her desire to return to Pakistan for the 2008 elections, and of Musharraf retaining the Presidency with Bhutto as Prime Minister. On August 29, 2007, Bhutto announced that Musharraf would step down as chief of the army.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/08/29/pakistan.negotiations/ Bhutto: 'Musharraf has agreed to quit as military chief'] Aug. 29, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/29/AR2007082900495.html?nav=rss_world Bhutto Expects Musharraf to Quit as Military Chief] Aug. 29, 2007</ref> On 1 September Bhutto vowed to return to Pakistan "very soon", regardless of whether or not she reached a power-sharing deal with Musharraf before then.<ref></ref>

On Supreme Court judges deliberated on six petitions (including one from Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan's largest Islamic group) asserting that Musharraf be disqualified from contending for the presidency of Pakistan. Bhutto stated that her party could join one of the opposition groups, potentially that of Nawaz Sharif. Attorney-general Malik Mohammed Qayyum stated that, pendente lite, the Election Commission was "''reluctant''" to announce the schedule for the presidential vote. Bhutto's party's Farhatullah Babar stated that the Constitution of Pakistan could bar Musharraf from being elected again because he was already chief of the army: "As Gen. Musharraf was disqualified from contesting for President, he has prevailed upon the Election Commission to arbitrarily and illegally tamper with the Constitution of Pakistan."<ref></ref>

Musharraf prepared to switch to a strictly civilian role by resigning from his position as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. He still faced other legal obstacles to running for re-election. On October 2, 2007, Gen. Musharraf named Lt. Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, as vice chief of the army starting October 8 with the intent that if Musharraf won the presidency and resigned his military post, Kayani would become chief of the army. Meanwhile, Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed stated that officials agreed to grant Benazir Bhutto amnesty versus pending corruption charges. She has emphasized the smooth transition and return to civilian rule and has asked Pervez Musharaf to shed uniform.<ref></ref> On October 5, 2007, Musharraf signed the National Reconciliation Ordinance, giving amnesty to Bhutto and other political leaders—except exiled former premier Nawaz Sharif—in all court cases against them, including all corruption charges. The Ordinance came a day before Musharraf faced the crucial presidential poll. Both Bhutto's opposition party, the PPP, and the ruling PMLQ, were involved in negotiations beforehand about the deal.<ref></ref> In return, Bhutto and the PPP agreed not to boycott the Presidential election.<ref></ref> On October 6, 2007, Musharraf won a parliamentary election for President. However, the Supreme Court ruled that no winner can be officially proclaimed until it finishes deciding on whether it was legal for Musharraf to run for President while remaining Army General. Bhutto's PPP party did not join the other opposition parties' boycott of the election, but did abstain from voting.<ref></ref> Later, Bhutto demanded security coverage on-par with the President's. Bhutto also contracted foreign security firms for her protection.

=== In fiction ===
 

Bela Kahn is a fictional character that may be loosely based the former Prime Minister. Elements of the lives of Kahn and Bhutto are strikingly similar. Bela Kahn forms a part of a growing list of fictional characters that many believe are based on the lives of real people. Bela Kahn appeared in the episode 14 in season 7 of Law & Order Criminal Intent named "Assassin".
