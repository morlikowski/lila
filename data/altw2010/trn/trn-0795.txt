Argentina a participat la toate ediţiile Campionatului Mondial de Rugby cea mai bună clasificare fiind în faza sferturilor de finală la ediţia din 1999. Argentina este singura naţiune majoră din rugby-ul internaţional care nu participă la nici o competiţie internaţională anuală de genul Turneului celor Trei sau Şase Naţiuni. În urma presiunilor forurilor internaţionale de rugby, este foarte posibil ca Argentina să se alăture Turneului celor Trei Naţiuni, principala competiţie internaţională anuală din emisfera de sud.

The '''Argentina national rugby team''', nicknamed '''''Los Pumas''''', represents Spanish: ''Unión Argentina de Rugby''). 

Argentina played its first international rugby match in 1910 against a touring British Isles team. It is today considered one of the top rugby nations in the world and the best in the the first in 1987.  

Although rugby union is nowhere near as popular as football in 1999 World Cup, have nonetheless seen the sport's popularity grow exponentially. Argentina has managed from its appearance in the international arena to accomplish several upset victories, and have been a tough contender when playing in France in the first game of the 2007 World Cup, took Argentina to fourth in the Scotland 19-13 in the quarter-final. Despite being beaten 37-13 by South Africa in the semi-finals, they defeated France for a second time in the tournament to claim the third place. As of 17 March 2008 the team is at an all-time high of third in the IRB World Rankings.

However, Argentina is currently the only Six Nations and the Tri Nations. Obstacles to this include international restrictions and the fact that domestic rugby in the country remains amateur.<ref name="Argentina deal"></ref> However, an IRB conference held the month after the 2007 World Cup saw a breakthrough. The UAR agreed to launch a professional structure, with considerable support from the IRB, with eventual admission to the Tri Nations possible around 2012, although that timetable has been viewed by some as unrealistic. Despite several close matches, first time wins over the world's top teams New Zealand and South Africa also remain elusive as of 2008.

After English club Leicester Tigers, the UAR spent nearly five months searching for a successor until opting for a two-coach setup, with former ''Pumas'' Santiago Phelan and Fabián Turnes taking over.<ref name="2008 coaches"/> The Pumas' current captain is Felipe Contepomi.

==History==
===Early years===
The first rugby union match in Argentina was played in 1873, the game having been brought to British immigrants. In 1899, four clubs in Argentina's capital, England national team but included three Scottish players — toured Argentina: the people of Argentina termed it the "Combined British", also known as a "Great Britain XV". Argentina made their international debut against this team, losing 28-3 on 12th July in Buenos Aires.

In 1927 the British Isles toured Argentina, with the Lions winning all nine encounters; the tour did however become a financial success for Argentinian rugby. Of the nine encounters, four tests were played, which Argentina lost by over 30 points in all. All the games took place in Buenos Aires. Five years passed until another international team would return to Argentina, which would be the Junior Springboks in 1932, playing a two match series. Argentina lost both.

In 1936 the British Isles visited Argentina again, winning all ten of their matches and only conceding nine points in the whole tour. Only one test was played on the tour, with Argentina losing 23-0. The following month Argentina left the country to play their first away tests - against Chile in Valparaiso. Argentina won the first test (and their first game), 29-0. The second match was won by a similar margin as well. Two years later Argentina hosted Chile, which resulted in Argentina winning by 30 points.

===Post war===
In the late 1940s Argentina hosted a combined Oxford & Cambridge side, which defeated them in both games of a two match series. In 1949 Argentina hosted their biggest nation yet - France, and although they lost both tests, the scorelines were very close on both occasions. To mark the 1951 Pan-American Games, Argentina organised the first South American tournament in Buenos Aires with Chile, Uruguay and Brazil taking part. Argentina dominated the inaugural tournament with Chile putting up the only challenge before losing 13-3 to the Pumas, whose thrashing of Uruguay 62-0 and the Brazilian team 72-0 highlighted their dominance in South America.

In 1952, Argentina played an Ireland XV in a non-cap international held in Buenos Aires. Argentina lost the first Test by six points but raised the bar in the second meeting in Buenos Aires to draw 3-3. It wasn't a win, but it was the first time Argentina had avoided defeat against a major European team and it was celebrated as a victory. As a result of the Irish tour, the UAR could not afford to host a visit from the Oxford & Cambridge team the following year. In 1954, they played host to France. The result was much the same as in 1949 with France proving far superior, winning 22-8 in the first Test before a 30-3 thrashing in the second, both of which were played in Buenos Aires.

In 1956, Argentina hosted Oxford & Cambridge again, but lost both of the fixtures 25-6 and 11-3. This was followed by a 4 to nil win over Peru, and a 50-3 win over Uruguay, though Argentina then lost to Chile for the first time. At the second South American tournament, in 1958, Argentina accounted for Uruguay 50-3 and Peru 44-0. And despite some drinking before their game against the hosts Chile in Santiago, Argentina's players still emerged victorious 14-0. In 1959 the Junior Springboks returned to Buenos Aires, winning both fixtures 14-6, and 20-6.

===Sixties, seventies and eighties===
In 1960, France visited Buenos Aires for a three match series with Argentina. The hosts still could not get their first win over the French, with France winning all three tests 37-3, 12-3 and 29-6. The following year Argentina again showed their dominance on a continental level, winning the South American tournament held in Montevideo, by beating Brazil 60-0, Uruguay 36-3 and Chile 11-3. In 1964 a new version of the South American tournament was played in San Pablo and Argentina again demonstrated their dominance with victories over Uruguay 25-6, Brazil 30-5 and Chile 30-8. 

Back in the late 1960s the four home unions began tours to Argentina, and after Wales struggled in both Tests in Buenos Aires in 1967 it soon became clear that Argentina would be a difficult place to win a series. Scotland became their next victims when the Pumas won the first test in 1968. The Scots won the second test two weeks later, but it was close.

The first trip of the Argentinean national rugby team to the other side of the Atlantic was to Rhodesia and South Africa in 1965. The team acquired the nickname "Pumas", from a local journalist after their first tour match, a defeat to Salisbury. The book "Be Pumas" recalls the Wackley Farmer of Rhodesia magazine commenting on the emblem embroidered on the tourists' jerseys was like a puma - rather than a jaguar. After defeats to Salisbury and Northern Transvaal, the first win came against Western Transvaal, another against South West Africa Country Districts and finally against the Southern Universities. The Pumas' landmark win against the Junior Springboks, by 11-6. They were welcomed home to Buenos Aires by a huge crowd; the tour had harvested 11 victories, one draw and four defeats over two months.

A match was then organised against the French champions Section Paloise, although the match was remembered for the uproar and misconduct of both teams rather than the Argentinean victory. Then Oxford & Cambridge arrived, a team that the Pumas had never beaten. The first match finished level at 19-19 and the second saw the University students triumph 9-3. 1965 ended with a match against Chile, which the Pumas won 23-11. 

In 1966, the Gazelles arrived, a kind of a Junior Springboks B team. The visitors took two victories 9-3 and 20-15. In September 1967, Argentina played in Buenos Aires in the South American Championship with victories over Uruguay 38-6 and Chile 18-0. Wales arrived in Buenos Aires in 1968 and for the first time in their history the Pumas were able to triumph in a series, winning the first match 9-5 and drawing the second 9-9. The first great decade in Argentinean rugby came to a close with the arrival of Scotland in 1969. The first match saw a big Argentinean victory 20-3, but in the second game the visitors narrowly won 6-3. 

Through the 1970s, Argentina confirmed its steady rise towards top-tier status under the impulse of its first truly world-class player, fly-half Wales, then the dominant force in the Northern Hemisphere. Only a Phil Bennett penalty on a foul by Gabrielo Travaglini at the death allowed the Welsh to escape with a 20-19 victory.

The early 1980s also saw the formation of the South American Jaguars, a team dominated by Argentinian players, which played eight matches against the Springboks including one win at Bloemfontein in 1982.

===Late 20th century===
From the late seventies to the early nineties, Argentina never lost the two matches of a series held in Buenos Aires, in a period that included victories against France, England, Australia and a 21-21 tie to the All Blacks, which is probably the most important result ever obtained by the Pumas, thanks to a terrific performance by Hugo Porta who scored all of Argentina's points.

By the time the first Fiji prevented the team from clinching the first round. Argentina won their first ever World Cup game when they defeated Italy in Christchurch.

On the following years, the retirement of many of Argentina's most experienced players, and the defection of many others to professional leagues (it should be mentioned that rugby union is still an amateur sport in Argentina and UAR's regulations of the time prevented any player who played professionally from playing for the national team) left Argentina with an inexperienced side.

This led to disappointing performances in the 1991 and 1995 World Cups, albeit in the latter Argentina presented a powerful forward pack which was praised by the international media. Argentina's tighthead props, the Wallabies.

In 1999, a more experienced and somewhat under-rated Argentina made it to the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time. They had finished second in their group to Wales, and went onto the quarter-final play-offs. After a vibrant 28-24 win against Ireland, they were eliminated by France, 28-47, in the quarter-final. Gonzalo Quesada was the highest overall points scorer in the tournament with 102.

===The new millennium===

In April 2000, 2003 World Cup quarter-finals due to a 15-16 loss to Ireland in a nail-biting game. It was noted that because of the fixture list, Argentina had to play four games in a fortnight, whereas Ireland played the same number of games in four weeks. It was suggested that Ireland, as a major nation, would not accept a similar fixture list, and that this may have played a role in the outcome of the game.

Since then they have shown good form, splitting a two-test home series with Wales in June Six Nations champion France a 24-14 loss in November Springboks of South Africa; however, the Pumas were without 10 regular starters who had returned to their club teams in Europe.

Perhaps the one of the Pumas' best matches in recent years came on tour to New Zealand. The Pumas were forced to choose a side of second- and even third-choice players (prop Mauricio Reggiardo, later voted man of the match, came out of retirement for the game) as 25 players from their selection pool were unavailable due to club commitments. However, a Pumas performance widely hailed as inspired, combined with lacklustre play by a mostly second-choice Lions side, put Argentina on the verge of one of the greatest upsets in recent rugby history. It took a Jonny Wilkinson penalty at the death&mdash;and arguably the decision by Australian referee Stuart Dickinson to allow eight minutes of added time at the end of the match&mdash;for the Lions to salvage a 25-25 draw and avoid a humiliating defeat.

When the Springboks returned to Argentina in November of that year, they faced a much stronger Pumas side, with most of their European-based players present. The Pumas took a 20-16 lead into the half-time break at Vélez Sársfield. While they faded in the second half, they were not embarrassed, losing 34-23. The following week, the Pumas travelled to Murrayfield to take on Scotland and won a closely-fought match 23-19. This marked the fifth consecutive time since 1990 that ''Los Pumas'' had defeated Scotland. They claimed another Six Nations scalp a week later, defeating Italy 39-22 in Genoa.

In the 2006 mid-year Tests, Argentina welcomed a Wales side for a two-Test tour. ''Los Pumas'' swept the series, marking their first Test series win over Wales. The first test, on settled by Welsh in the 1860s and where Welsh is still frequently spoken. The second Test at Vélez Sársfield on June 17 saw the Pumas take a 45-13 lead before two late Welsh tries cut the final margin to 45-27. This did, however, mark Argentina's largest win ever over Wales. ''Los Pumas'' next entertained the world's top team, the All Blacks, at Vélez Sársfield the following week. The All Blacks won 25-19, but not until surviving an all-out Pumas assault on their try line in the final minutes.

On 9th July, Argentina defeated Uruguay 26-0 in a Round 3a match during the Americas qualifying for the 2007 World Cup. Being their second win during that stage, Argentina moved directly into the 2007 World Cup, taking the Americas 1 position. They joined Pool D, along with hosts France and Ireland.

The 2006 end-of-year Tests began with a bang for ''Los Pumas'', as they went into Twickenham and handed  a 25-18 defeat. The error-riddled England side were booed off the Twickenham pitch after they crashed to their seventh consecutive Test defeat, equalling their worst ever run.<ref></ref> Further success followed for the Pumas, going on to defeat Italy in Rome and then coming within one point of achieving a similar result against France in Paris.

''Los Pumas'' had been invited by the Belgian Rugby Federation to play their local games there in case of being accepted in an annual competition.<ref> [http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/11/27/deportes/d-02703.htm Oferta para ser local en Bélgica  ]</ref> Soon after they also received invitations from Spain, Switzerland, France and Portugal.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/01/26/um/m-01352006.htm A la UAR le llueven ofertas para la concentración de Los Pumas previa al Mundial]</ref>
