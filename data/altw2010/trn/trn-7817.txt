'''Richard Penniman''', bekend onder de artiestennaam '''Little Richard''' (Macon, Georgia, Verenigde Staten, 5 december 1932) is een Amerikaanse zanger en pianist van Afro-Amerikaanse afkomst die geldt als een der belangrijkste grondleggers van de rock 'n roll. Hij wordt vaak in één adem genoemd met Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley en Buddy Holly. Door het gebruik van de piano vertoont zijn rock enerzijds overenkomst met die van Jerry Lee Lewis, anderzijds met die van Fats Domino, terwijl hij met een grote nadruk op uiterlijk vertoon en kenmerkende hoge uithalen wel als voorloper van de glamrock gezien wordt.

Richard is het derde kind uit een gezin van zestien, en doet in zijn jeugd muzikale ervaring op als pianist in de kerk. Na in 1951 op een talentenjacht ontdekt te zijn maakt hij enige plaatjes, die echter niet aanslaan. Als in Blueberry Hill, die allemaal de status van gouden plaat behalen. Na zijn successen trekt hij zich in 1957 terug, als hij voor een journalist verklaart dat rock 'n roll, met zijn obscene teksten en sterk seksuele lading, tegen Gods wil is en een dure ring in de Hunter River bij Sydney wierp. In 1962, toen rock 'n roll al veel meer geaccepteerd was, maakte hij zijn rentree met een Britse tournee. Hij werd hierbij gesteund door een paar van zijn Britse fans, The Beatles en de Rolling Stones. In de tussentijd had hij een aantal gospelplaten opgenomen. Daarna treedt hij nog af en toe op, en maakt hij ook nog platen, al steekt hij de meeste tijd in zijn loopbaan als predikant. Een moeilijk moment, gezien zijn religieuze achtergrond, was de toegave dat hij homoseksueel was, al dachten velen dat altijd al.

Little Richard speelde na 1980 incidenteel mee met jongere popartiesten, zoals Elvis Costello. Ook rapte hij in het nummer ''Elvis is Dead'' van Living Colour en speelde hij incidenteel in films. Bij de opening van de Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 werd hij als een van de eersten opgenomen. Vrij recent nog toerde hij samen met Chuck Berry door de Verenigde Staten en droeg hij bij aan een tribute-album voor Johnny Cash.

'''Rev. Richard Wayne Penniman''' (born American singer, songwriter and pianist, who began songwriting and performing publically (outside of the church) in 1945 and was a key figure in the transition from rhythm & blues to rock and roll in the 1950s.  

Penniman's reputation rests on a string of groundbreaking hit singles from 1955 through 1957, such as "Tutti Frutti", "Lucille" and "Long Tall Sally", which helped lay the foundation for rock and roll music,<ref name=RockHallofFame>{{cite web

He was subsequently honored by being one of seven of the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 and was one of only four of these honorees (along with Ray Charles, James Brown, and Fats Domino) to also receive the Rhythm & Blues Foundation's Pioneer Lifetime Achievement Award. 

Little Richard's early work was a mix of Christian, enrolled in and attended Bible college, and withdrew from recording and performing secular music.<ref name="white">White, Charles. (2003). ''The Life and Times of Little Richard: The Authorised Biography.'' Omnibus Press. </ref>  Claiming he was called to be an evangelist, he has since devoted large segments of his life to this calling.<ref name="white">White, Charles.(2003).</ref>

Little Richard has earned wide praise from many other performers. James Brown called Little Richard his idol <ref name="white" /> and credited him with "first putting the funk in the rock and roll beat."<ref name=RockHallofFame>{{cite web

|work=Inductees|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref> Smokey Robinson said Penniman's music was "the start of that driving, funky, never let up rock 'n' roll;", while Dick Clark described his music as "the model for almost every rock and roll performer of the '50s and years thereafter." Ray Charles asserted that Little Richard was "the man that started a kind of music that set the pace for a lot of what's happening today." In his high school year book, Bob Dylan declared that his ambition was "to follow Little Richard." In 1969, Elvis Presley told Little Richard, "Your music has inspired me - you are the greatest.".<ref name="white">White, Charles. (2003).

Omnibus Press., Pg. 227.</ref> Otis Redding, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Mick Jagger, John Fogerty, Dick Dale, Bob Seger, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, and numerous other rock n' roll icons have also cited Little Richard as being their first major influence. He was chosen as the 8th greatest artist of all time by Rolling Stone<ref>http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty</ref>, although at least six of the seven artists that preceded him on the list were heavily influenced by his music, and, he was the person who cited himself as the 8th best artist of all time.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Penniman was born in née Stewart) and Charles "Bud" Penniman, who was a bootlegger.<ref name=RockHallofFame>

}}</ref> He grew up in a religious family, amid poverty and racism, and it was singing that made his family feel closer to God. His family had a group called the Penniman Singers, who would go around and sing in local churches, and enter contests with other singing families. Richard's siblings called him 'War Hawk' because of his loud, screaming singing voice. His paternal grandfather, Walter Penniman, was a preacher, and his father's family were members of the Foundation Templar African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in Macon, Georgia. Richard's maternal grandmother was a member of the Holiness Temple healer, singing Gospel songs and touching people, who would testify that they felt better after he ministered to them. Inspired by Brother Joe May, a singing evangelist known as 'The Thunderbolt of the West', Richard wanted to become a preacher. It was in and through the church where Richard's life in music all began.<ref name="white">White, Charles. (2003). ''The Life and Times of Little Richard: The Authorised Biography.'' Pg. 15-17. Omnibus Press. </ref>

Nearly all of Richard Penniman's dramatic phrasing and swift vocal turns are derived from Black Gospel artists of the 1930s and 1940s. He referred to Billy Wright, who was known as the 'Prince of the Blues'.<ref name="white">White, Charles. (2003). ''The Life and Times of Little Richard: The Authorised Biography.'' p. 25. Omnibus Press. </ref> It is reported that he got one of the inflections ("Lucille-uh") in his vocal from Ruth Brown. 

One of Penniman's main influences on his piano-playing was bass. Penniman met Esquerita when he traveled through Macon with a preacher named Sister Rosa. Another influence was Brother Joe May. Penniman explained, ''"I used to get in a room and try to make my piano sound just like him. He had so much energy."'' May generated energy by moving from a subtle whisper to a thunderous tenor and back in a four-bar phrase.

He learned to mix ministerial qualities with theatrics by watching the traveling medicine shows that rolled through his native Macon. Colorful medicine men would wear lavish capes, robes and turbans, all of which left an impression on Penniman.

===1950s===
In 1951, Penniman won a talent show in Atlanta, which resulted in a recording contract with RCA.  In 1952, Penniman's father was murdered. After this, he returned to Macon and performed blues and boogie-woogie music at the "Tick Tock Club" in the evenings.  He went on to record for Peacock Records in Houston<ref name=nite>Nite, Norm N. ''Rock On: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock n' Roll (The Solid Gold Years)''. Thomas Y. Crowell (1974), p. 390. ISBN 0-690-00583-0.</ref> from 1951 to 1955. His style at this time was modeled after jump blues recording artist Billy Wright. In early 1955, he recorded his last two singles for Peacock backed by the Johnny Otis Trio (one of the songs, "Little Richard's Boogie", offers a glimmer of the style that later made him famous). These records sold poorly and Penniman had little success until he sent a demo tape to Specialty Records on February 17, 1955. Specialty's owner, Art Rupe, purchased Richard's contract from Peacock and placed Richard's career in the hands of A&R man Robert "Bumps" Blackwell.<ref name=nite/>  Blackwell had nurtured and groomed Ray Charles (then known as R.C. Robinson) and Quincy Jones at the start of their careers in the music business. 

Blackwell had intended to pit Little Richard against Ray Charles and Tutti Frutti", in his raspy, shouted vocal style, while pounding out a boogie-woogie based loose booty" to "tutti frutti, aw rooty."<ref>[http://www.wwnorton.com/college/music/rockhistory/reverb/int01_01.htm What's That Sound? • W. W. Norton and Company, Inc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The song was released on Specialty in late 1955, and became the first of Richard's many hits.<ref name=nite/>

The song, with Little Richard shouting its unique introductory "A-wop-bop-a-loo-mop-a-whop-bam-boom!", was the start of a rapid succession of Little Richard hit songs, characterized by a driving piano, boogie-woogie bass, funky Lee Allen, such as "Lucille", "Rip It Up", "The Girl Can't Help It", "Slippin' and Slidin'", "Jenny, Jenny", "Good Golly, Miss Molly", and "Keep A-Knockin'". His performing style can be seen in such period films as ''Don't Knock the Rock'' (1956) and ''The Girl Can't Help It'' (also 1956), for which he sang the title song.

In the commercial fashion of the day, several of his early hits were re-recorded in other styles. Little Richard's first national success, "Tutti Frutti," was covered by Pat Boone, whose version outdid the source record, #12 to #17. Boone also released a version of "Long Tall Sally," with slightly bowdlerized lyrics. But this time, the Little Richard original outperformed it on the Billboard charts, #6 to #8. Bill Haley tackled Little Richard's third major hit, "Rip It Up," but again, Little Richard prevailed. With the record-buying public's preference established, Little Richard's subsequent releases did not face the same chart competition.

Then, suddenly, when at the top of the music world, Little Richard, fearing his own damnation, abandoned rock and roll music to become a born again Christian, in which he was called to be an evangelist.  Although his secular music career in the 1950s was rather brief, his impact on twentieth and twenty-first century music was incalculable and arguably unparalleled.   

While Little Richard's retreat to the faith in which he was groomed as a child resulted in an abrupt halt to the recording style that made him famous and changed the world of music, he continued in and out of rock 'n' roll and the ministry into the twenty-first century. He recorded only Gospel music after his spiritual conversion from 1957 to the early 1960s, claiming at the time that rock music was of the devil and that it was not possible to be a rocker and please God at the same time.  He was married in 1959.

===1960s===
In 1963, with the Beatles as his opening act, on a tour of parts of Europe, Little Richard backslid from the ministry and his calling.  He returned to recording and performing secular material.  He was divorced in 1964.  That year, he again toured Europe with a then-unknown band by the name of The Rolling Stones.  In 1964, he brought a fledgling Jimi Hendrix into his band. In 1966, Hendrix was quoted as saying, "I want to do with my guitar what Little Richard does with his voice."  

===1970s===
Little Richard had minor hits in the 1960s and 1970s, although not with the greater success of his 1950s recordings.

In 1977, following the death of a nephew that he loved as a son, he repented for his wayward living and returned to evangelism.  He then recorded more Gospel music and remained fully in the ministry until the mid-1980s.  He also represented Memorial Bibles International and sold their Black Heritage Bible, which highlighted the many people in the Bible who were Black.  In many sermons during this period, he once again proclaimed that it was not possible to perform rock and serve God at the same time.

===1980s===
In the mid-1980s, the world's attention was refocused on Little Richard, following the release of Charles White's critically acclaimed, authorized biography ''The Life and Times of Little Richard'', in which he candidly explains his struggles with and repentance from substance abuse and homosexuality.  At the same time, the new Rock and Roll Hall of Fame honored Little Richard as one of the first inductees.  This resulted in a show business comeback for Little Richard.

In 1986, Little Richard finally reconciled his role as a minister and as a rock and roll artist.  He recorded an album of inspirational songs for Warner Brother Records that he called "message music" and "messages in rhythm."  He had his old friend Billy Preston help him write a song with spiritual lyrics that sounded like rock and roll for the soundtrack of the motion picture ''Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' in which he also co-starred.  The result was "Great Gosh A'Mighty", which became a hit; he also received critical acclaim for his acting performance.
