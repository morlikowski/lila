'''John Mark Karr''' (Amerikaanse basisschoolleraar uit Georgia. Op 16 augustus 2006 werd hij gearresteerd in Bangkok, Thailand als resultaat van een onderzoek naar de moord op JonBenét Ramsey. Hij gaf toe bij de dood van het zesjarige schoonheidskoninginnetje op 25 december 1996 aanwezig geweest te zijn. Hij werd opgespoord aan de hand van door hem verstuurde emails. Volgens Karr was de dood van Ramsey ''"een ongeluk"''. 

Karr werd op 20 augustus vanuit Thailand overgebracht naar de Verenigde Staten. Daar werd verder onderzoek gedaan, waarbij bleek dat zijn DNA niet overeenkwam met het DNA dat gevonden was op het lichaam van Ramsey. De aanklacht wegens moord werd daarom ingetrokken.

==Achtergrond==
Volgens zijn broer, Nate Karr, woonde John Mark Karr als kind bij zijn grootouders in Hamilton, Alabama. Hij was daar de beste van zijn klas. In 1982 haalde hij zijn diploma van de middelbare school. In 1984 trouwde Karr op negentienjarige leeftijd met het dertienjarige meisje Quientana Shotts. Karr zou het meisje hebben opgedragen te liegen over haar leeftijd en nam haar mee naar Alabama, om daar met haar te trouwen. In het rechtbankarchief werd teruggevonden, dat in 1985 een toen veertienjarig meisje een nietigverklaring van een huwelijk wilde. Ze zou voor haar leven hebben gevreesd toen besloot met Karr te trouwen. Karr gaf in de rechtbank toe dat ze minderjarig was, maar ontkende dat ze pas dertien was. Het huwelijk werd nietigverklaard.

Op 9 mei 1989 trouwde John Mark Karr in Alabama op 24-jarige leeftijd met de zestienjarige, zwangere Lara Knutson. De tweeling die ze baarde, genaamd Angel (''Engel'') en Innocense (''Onschuldigheid''), overleed op 1 september 1989, de dag waarop ze thuis beviel. Later kreeg het echtpaar nog drie zonen. Ze scheidden in 2001, nadat Karr in Californië was gearresteerd voor het bezit van kinderporno.

Karr werkte als invalleraar in Petaluma, Californië. Hij werd door de schooldirectie als een slecht functionerende leraar bestempeld. Van december 2000 tot maart 2001 werkte Karr op veertien verschillende basisscholen in Petaluma en omstreken. Zijn laatste loonstrookje als leraar dateerde van april 2000, dezelfde maand waarin hij voor het eerst terecht stond voor het bezit van kinderporno. Toen hij in december 2001 niet kwam opdagen bij een zitting, vaardigde de rechter een arrestatiebevel uit, dat in augustus 2006 nog steeds van kracht was.

==Arrestatie==
Karr werd op 16 augustus 2006 gearresteerd in Bangkok, na een maandenlang onderzoek naar de moord op dollar van de ouders van Ramsey had geëist en haar had gewurgd toen zijn plan mislukte.

==Background==
Karr was born in Conyers, Georgia<ref name=CNN-LC2>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/08/25/ramsey.arrest/index.html "Judge issues gag order in Ramsey case"], ''CNN'', retrieved August 26 2006</ref> and spent his early childhood in Atlanta.<ref name=AJC>[http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/0820metkarr.html "Karr's life combed for clues to slaying"], ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', retrieved August 22 2006</ref> His father, Wexford Karr, married Patricia Elaine Adcock on August 21, 1958, when he was 37 and she was 18, according to court documents. Wexford filed for divorce in 1973 eleven years after the marriage in Clayton County, Georgia, saying the marriage was "irretrievably broken," and that the boys were in his custody. Soon after, Wexford Karr, then 52, married 29-year-old Susan Simpson, his neighbor in the same apartment complex.<ref name="ABC21">Francescani, Chris.

A family friend, Jonathan McCrary, has said that Karr's mother believed John Karr was possessed by demons. His mother allegedly built a Central State Hospital, a mental institution, in Milledgeville, Georgia, and later lived in a group home, according to her stepmother, Shirley Adcock.<ref name="ABC21"/><ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/nation/stories/082306dnnatjonbenet.2ea9c1f.html "JonBenet suspect agrees to face charges in Colorado"], ''Dallas Morning News'', August 22 2006.</ref>

Karr moved to Alabama to live with his grandparents when he was about 12 years old. He grew up in Hamilton<ref name=AJC/> and graduated from Hamilton High School in 1983.<ref name=waff>[http://www.waff.com/Global/story.asp?S=5294124 "Karr's former classmate speaks with WAFF 48 News"], ''WAFF48News'', retrieved August 23 2006</ref> According to his brother, Nate Karr, John was at the top of his high school class.<ref name=Vaughan17>Vaughan Kevin; Burnett, Sara; Mitchell, Nancy.

Karr also sold used cars and was known in his Alabama town for his car, a red De Lorean with gull-wing doors. Karr returned to live in Atlanta at least twice: once to attend one semester at Riverwood High School in Sandy Springs from January to May in 1981, and again some years after graduating from high school.<ref name=AJC/>

In March 1996, Karr started "a world wide support organization for kids, teens and college students." He stated "all my plans revolve around kids... I have 3 children of my own and I don't know what I would do if they were taken from me."<ref>http://groups.google.com/group/alt.missing-kids/msg/a45d5b900f4cb1d2?dmode=source</ref>

===Marriages and divorce===
In 1984, when he was 19 years old, Karr married a 13-year-old girl<ref name=MSNBC17>[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14400501/"Karr drove flashy car, wedded teens"], ''MSNBC'', August 17 2006.</ref> named Quientana Ray Shotts, according to Shotts' mother, Melissa Shotts. Karr evidently told Quientana to lie about her age, and took her out of Alabama, where they both lived, to marry her. Karr and Shotts lived together as a couple in Hamilton after their wedding, and Karr "was abusing her every way there was," according to Melissa Shotts.<ref name=Bartels17>Bartels, Lynn.

Karr admitted to the court that she was a minor, but disputed she had been 13. The marriage was annulled<ref name=MSNBC17/> in 1985. Shotts later remarried and now bears a different surname.<ref name=ajc-2>[http://www.ajc.com/news/content/metro/stories/0817metshotts.html "Ex-wife says she was intimidated into marrying at 14"], ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', retrieved August 17 2006.</ref>

===Career===
Karr had been working as a substitute teacher in Petaluma, but Bob Raines, a superintendent and principal at Wilson School in Petaluma said he was an ineffective teacher: "He just seemed like somebody who thought he wanted to be a teacher... After a few days, I could see it just wasn't for him."<ref> Tsai, Catherine.

Karr also operated a day care center in northwest Alabama. The Marion County Department of Human Resources issued a license for Karr to begin operating a day care out of his home in June 1997. Under the license, Karr was allowed to care for as many as six children at a time, ranging in age up to 14 years old.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/nation/4140202.html "JonBenet case suspect operated day care center"], ''Associated Press'', retrieved August 25 2006.</ref>

==2001 arrest==
On April 13, 2001, Karr was arrested for possession of computerized child pornography.  He pleaded not guilty four days later.  On October 15, 2001, after a series of court hearings, Karr was released from jail, but was ordered to report to a probation officer. The court records in the case were sealed. In December 2001, Karr failed to appear and a "No Bail" warrant was issued by a Sonoma County Superior Court Judge.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2326817&page=3 "Timeline of John Mark Karr"], "ABC News", August 17 2006.</ref> Since then Karr had been on the run, living in Asia, Europe and Central America, until his arrest in Thailand.

==New lead in JonBenét case==

In June 2006, the Boulder District Attorney's office received copies of the suspect's emails from University of Colorado journalism professor Michael Tracey, who received the emails from a person with the email address "December261996@yahoo.com." December 26, 1996, was the date of JonBenét's murder. At least one of the emails was signed with the signature "Daxis."<ref name=CaseBreak>[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4933325,00.html "Karr's email address is date of JonBenet death"], ''Rocky Mountain News'', retrieved August 21 2006</ref>

Armed with the email address and Internet service provider, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) determined the general location of the suspect in Thung Maha Mek, a neighborhood in Bangkok, Thailand. At the time, the suspect's name and exact location was not known.<ref name=CaseBreak/>

Authorities identified and found Karr when he sent an envelope to Tracey by regular mail with a return address bearing the name of a major thoroughfare in Bangkok, but no number or cross street.<ref name=CaseBreak/> Tracey sent Karr another kind of mail &ndash; a photograph delivered to a Thai post office box. Agents arranged a controlled delivery and were ready to spot their suspect. The man who arrived to pick up the mail delivery was using a 21-speed bicycle, the purchase of which was mentioned in e-mails sent by the suspect. The agents followed Karr to his residence and learned his name.<ref name=abcnews-snip>[http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2331131 "Exclusive: How John Mark Karr Was Caught"], ''ABC News'', retrieved August 22 2006</ref>

On August 11, 2006, they notified ICE officials, and from that point on, Karr was placed under surveillance by Thai immigration officials.<ref name=CaseBreak/> A sealed arrest warrant, signed by Boulder County District Judge Roxanne Bailin,<ref name=AP-Deutsch>Deutch, Linda.[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060821/ap_on_re_us/jonbenet_ramsey "Ramsey murder suspect awaits extradition"], ''Associated Press'', published by Yahoo.com August 21 2006, retrieved August 22 2006</ref> was sent by the Boulder District Attorney's office to officials in Thailand on August 15, 2006. The next day, upon receipt of the warrant, Thai immigration authorities revoked Karr's visa.<ref name=CaseBreak/>
