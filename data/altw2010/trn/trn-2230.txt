'''Modern Orthodox Judaism''' (or '''Modern Orthodox''' or '''Modern Orthodoxy''') is a movement within traditional observance and values with the secular, modern world.
Modern Orthodoxy draws on several teachings and philosophies, and thus assumes various forms. In the "Centrist Orthodoxy" — underpinned by the philosophy of  ''Torah Umadda'' ("Torah and Knowledge/Science) — is prevalent.  In Israel, Modern Orthodoxy is dominated by Religious Zionism; however, although not identical, these movements share many of the same values and many of the same adherents <ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_4_47/ai_54600118#continue Modern orthodoxy in Israel | Judaism | Find Articles at BNET.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

== Philosophy ==
Modern Orthodoxy comprises a fairly broad spectrum of movements each drawing on several distinct, though related, philosophies, which in some combination provide the basis for all variations of the movement today; these are discussed below.

In general, Modern Orthodoxy holds that Jewish law is transforming the world to benefit humanity”. 
At the same time, in order to preserve the integrity of halakha, any area of “powerful inconsistency and conflict” between Torah and modern culture must be filtered out. <ref>http://shma.com/feb01/berman.htm</ref>. 

Modern Orthodoxy, additionally, assigns a central role to the "People of Israel" <ref>[http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/document.cfm?title=Some%20Comments%20on%20Centrist%20Orthodoxy&hyperlink=lamm21%2Ehtml&type=Document&category=Orthodoxy%20and%20Modernity&authortitle=Rabbi%20Dr&firstname=Norman&lastname=Lamm&pubsource=Tradition%2C%2022%3A3&authorid=285 Rabbi Norman Lamm: Some Comments on Centrist Orthodoxy]</ref>.  Modern Orthodoxy, in general, places a high national, as well as religious, significance on the outreach" to continued institutional relations and cooperation; see further under ''Torah Umadda''.

===Roots===
Modern Orthodoxy traces its roots to the works of philosophic and pragmatic contributions - Hirsch's role is less clear, with some Hirsch scholars arguing that his "Torah im Derech Eretz" philosophy is in fact at odds with that of Modern Orthodoxy; see further below and in the Hildesheimer article.

====Torah im Derech Eretz====
Hirsch’s ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' (תורה עם דרך ארץ – “Torah with the way of the Land”) is a philosophy of Orthodox Judaism which formalises a relationship between halakhically observant Judaism and the modern world. Hirsch held that Judaism requires the application of Torah philosophy to all human endeavor and knowledge compatible with it. Thus, secular education becomes a positive religious duty. "Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life... in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit... with the pen and the chisel" <ref>[http://www.ucalgary.ca/%7Eelsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/SRHirsch.html S. R. Hirsch: "Religion Allied to Progress"<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Hirsch's vision, although not unqualified, extended to the sciences as well as to (German) literature, philosophy and culture. Torah im Derech Eretz remains influential to this day in all branches of Orthodox Judaism. 

Note that Neo Orthodoxy, the movement descended from Hirsch’s below.

====Hildesheimer's pragmatism====
Azriel Hildesheimer, along with Rabbi Hirsch, was insistent that for Orthodox Jews living in the
west, there was no possibility to segregate oneself behind ghetto walls. On the contrary, modern Jewish education must teach Jews how best to confront and deal with modernity in all of its aspects <ref name="autogenerated3">http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/%2FTU9%5FShapiro%2Epdf</ref>. 

His approach, "Cultured Orthodoxy", was defined as representing "unconditional agreement with the culture of the present day; harmony between Judaism and science; but also unconditional steadfastness in the faith and traditions of Judaism" <ref name="autogenerated3" />. 

He was, however, "the pragmatist rather than the philosopher", and it is his actions, rather than his philosophy, which have become institutionalized in Modern Orthodoxy <ref name="autogenerated5">[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_n1_v42/ai_13796421/print Judaism: Dilemmas of modern orthodoxy: sociological and philosophical<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and through which his influence is still felt.
*He established Jewish education for males and females, which included both religious and secular studies. 
*He established yeshivot incorporating modern Jewish studies, secular studies and academic scholarship in its curriculum. 
*He was non-sectarian, and worked with communal leaders, even non-Orthodox ones, on issues that affected the community. 
*He maintained traditional attachments to the Land of Israel and worked with the non-Orthodox on its behalf.

===Torah Umadda===
''personal (as opposed to synthesis" between Torah scholarship and Western, secular scholarship, entailing, also, positive involvement with the broader community. Here, the "individual has absorbed the attitudes characteristic of science, democracy and Jewish life and responds appropriately in diverse relations and contexts" <ref name="autogenerated7">http://www.yutorah.org/_materials/ACF4B2B.pdf</ref>. The resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism is referred to as "Centrist Orthodoxy". 
 
This philosophy, as formulated today, is to a large extent a product of the teachings and philosophy of HaRav Halakhic Man" must therefore attempt to bring the sanctity and purity of the transcendent realm into the material world <ref>[http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/rav/rav13.htm rav13<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Centrist Orthodoxy is the dominant mode of Modern Orthodoxy in the United States, while Torah Umadda remains closely associated with Yeshiva University.
<!-- It is significant that the name of a Litvish yeshiva located in Brooklyn, ''Torah V'Daas'', has an almost identical translation as Torah Umadda, but has escaped controversy primarily because in practice it does not have the same connotation. As a result, its administration is not as polarized and controversial as that of Yeshiva University, for example.-->
Torah Umadda is related to Hirsch's ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', but see below for a comparison between the two.

===Religious Zionism===
Modern Orthodoxy draws on the teachings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1864 – 1935) - both as regards its views on Jewish Peoplehood and as regards the (related) interaction with the secular world. 
*“Rav Kook” saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme finally to result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland, bringing salvation ("Geula") to the Jewish people, and the entire world. 
*In Rav Kook’s thought ''Kodesh'' and ''Chol'' (sacred and profane) play an extremely important role. Here, ''Kodesh'' is the inner ''taam'' (reason) of reality and the meaning of existence while ''Chol'' is that which is detached from ''Kodesh'' and is without any meaning; Judaism, then, is the vehicle "whereby we sanctify our lives, and attach all the practical, secular elements of life to spiritual goals which reflect the absolute meaning of existence - G-d Himself" <ref>http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/rk1-kook.htm</ref>.

==Comparison with other movements==
Various, highly differing views are offered under the banner of Modern Orthodoxy, ranging from traditionalist to revisionist. In addition, some elements of Haredi Judaism ("Ultra-Orthodox Judaism") appear to be more receptive to messages that have traditionally been part of the Modern-Orthodox agenda. At the same time, Modern Orthodoxy’s left wing may appear to align with more traditional elements of Conservative Judaism. Thus, in clarifying its position, it is useful to discuss Modern Orthodoxy with reference to other movements in Judaism.

===Haredi Judaism ===
:''See also under Centrist Orthodoxy and Divine Providence for further elaboration of the differences discussed here.''
Although there is some question as how precisely to define the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Haredi Judaism, there is basic agreement that they may be distinguished on the basis of three major characteristics:  <ref>http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/4_1_waxman.pdf</ref>
#Modern Orthodoxy adopts a relatively inclusive attitude stance toward society in general, and the larger Jewish community in particular. 
#Modern Orthodoxy is, in comparison, accommodating, “if not welcoming” to modernity, general scholarship and science.
#Modern Orthodoxy is almost uniformly receptive toward Israel and Zionism, viewing the State of Israel (in addition to the Land of Israel) as having inherent religious significance.

A fourth difference suggested, relates to the acceptability of moderation within Jewish law. Both Modern Orthodoxy and Ultra Orthodoxy regard ''Halakha'' as Divine in origin, and as such, no position is assumed without justification in the Shulkhan Arukh and in the Acharonim. The movements differ, however, in their approach to strictures (''chumras'') and leniencies (''kulas''). 

*Modern Orthodoxy holds that strictures are not normative, rather, these are a matter of personal choice <ref name="autogenerated6">[http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/diverse.cfm#Chumrah Search Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>; "severity and leniency are relevant only in circumstances of factual doubt, not in situations of debate or varied practice. In the latter situations, the conclusion should be based solely on the legal analysis". Note though, that in recent years, many Modern Orthodox Jews are described as "increasingly stringent in their adherence to Jewish law" <ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/orthostate.html The State of Orthodox Judaism Today<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

*In the Haredi view, on the other hand, "the most severe position... is the most likely basis for unity and commonality of practice within the Orthodox community and is therefore to be preferred". Further, "such severity... results in the greatest certainty that God's will is being performed." <ref name="autogenerated6" />. ''Haredi'' Judaism thus tends to adopt ''chumras'' as a norm.

=== Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz ===

Please note when editing this subsection: 
In regards to the debate as to whether MO and TIDE overlap please be sure to state BOTH viewpoints in accord with Npov#Balance:
"When reputable sources contradict one another, the core of the NPOV policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources, and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner."
 -->
Both Modern Orthodoxy and Neo Orthodoxy, the movement directly descended from Hirsch’s Frankfurt community, have combined Torah and secular knowledge with participation in contemporary western life, and thus some maintain that there is a degree of practical and philosophical overlap between the two. The movements are nevertheless distinct, and in general, Neo-Orthodoxy has taken a more qualified approach than Modern orthodoxy, emphasizing that followers must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.  

Note though that differences between the movements may be more than a question of degree: Hirsch scholars argue that Hirschian philosophy is at odds with that of Modern Orthodoxy <ref>see, for example: Joseph Elias' introduction to ''The Nineteen Letters''. Feldheim,1995. ISBN 0873066960 </ref>, while Modern Orthodox scholars maintain that Modern Orthodoxy accords with Hirsch's worldview <ref>see, for example: Norman Lamm ''Torah Umadda: The Encounter of Religious Learning and Worldly Knowledge in the Jewish Tradition''. Jason Aronson, 1994.  ISBN 1568212313 </ref>. These philosophical distinctions (though subtle), manifest in markedly divergent religious attitudes and perspectives; in fact, Shimon Schwab, second Rabbi of this community in the United States, is described as being "spiritually very distant" from Yeshiva University and Modern Orthodoxy  <ref>Prof. Chaim Waxman [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_n1_v42/ai_13796421/print ''Dilemmas of modern orthodoxy: sociological and philosophical''] </ref>.

From the viewpoint of Neo-Orthodoxy, that movement differs from Modern Orthodoxy (and particularly Centrist Orthodoxy) on three main counts <ref>See, for example, Joseph Elias's Introduction to "The Nineteen Letters", Feldheim, 1995. ISBN 0873066960; note also that others claim that these distinctions - save the last one - are unclear and/or unsubstantiated given the selective nature of the evidence. </ref>.

*The role of secular life and culture: In the Hirschian view, interaction with the secular - and the requisite acquisition of culture and knowledge - is encouraged, insofar as it facilitates the application of Torah to wordly matters. For Modern Orthodoxy, on the other hand, secular culture and knowledge are seen as a complement to Torah, and, to some extent, encouraged for their own sake. Some would suggest that in Modern Orthodoxy, Judaism is enriched by interaction with modernity, whereas in Neo-Orthodoxy human experience (and modernity) are enriched by the application of Torah outlook and practice.

*Priority of Torah versus Secular knowledge: In the Hirschian view, Torah is the "sole barometer of truth" by which to judge secular disciplines, as "there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally." (Hirsch, commentary to Leviticus 18:4-5). By contrast, in the view of Modern Orthodoxy, although Torah is the "preeminent center", secular knowledge is considered to offer "a different perspective that may not agree at all with [Torah] ... [but] both together present the possibility of a larger truth." (''Torah Umadda'', p. 236).

*Broader communal involvement: Neo-Orthodoxy, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''Austritt'' (secession), "could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people", and is therefore opposed to the ''involvement with the broader Jewish Community and by its Religious Zionism.

===Religious Zionism===
Broadly defined, redemptive state through natural means, and often attributing religious significance to the modern State of Israel.  (This attitude is rejected by most Haredim - but not all, particularly the Hardal movement.)  Thus, in this sense, Religious Zionism in fact encompasses a wide spectrum of religious views including Modern Orthodoxy. 

Note however, that Modern Orthodoxy, in fact, overlaps to a large extent with “Religious Zionism” in its narrower form ('Throughout the world a "religious Zionist day school" is a synonym for a "modern Orthodox day school"' <ref> Rav Yosef Blau [http://www.mizrachi.org/ideas/view.asp?id=122 ''Religious Zionism And Modern Orthodoxy''] </ref>).  At the least, the two are not in any direct conflict, and generally coexist <ref>  Charles S. Liebman [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_4_47/ai_54600118#continue ''Modern orthodoxy in Israel'']</ref>,  sharing both values and adherents. Further, in practice, except at their extremes, the differences between Religious Zionism and Modern Orthodoxy in Israel are not pronounced, and they are often identical, especially in recent years and for the younger generation  <ref name="autogenerated2"> Shlomo Fischer [http://www.vanleer.org.il/Data/UploadedFiles/Files/fundamentalis.doc  ''Fundamentalist or Romantic Nationalist?: Israeli Modern Orthodoxy''] </ref>.

Nevertheless, the two movements are philosophically distinct on two broad counts. 
*Firstly, (conservative) Religious Zionists differ with Modern Orthodoxy in its approach to secular knowledge <ref>  Ami Isseroff  [http://www.zionism-israel.com/ezine/religious_zionism.htm ''Religious Zionism Revisits the State of Israel''] </ref>.   Here, engagement with the secular is permissible, and encouraged, but only insofar as this benefits the further under ''Torah Umadda''.
*Secondly, under Religious Zionism, a “nationalistic coloration” is given to traditional religious concepts, whereas, by contrast, Modern Orthodoxy includes “a greater balance which includes openness to the non-Jewish world” <ref> Rav Yosef Blau [http://www.mizrachi.org/ideas/view.asp?id=122 ''Religious Zionism And Modern Orthodoxy'']  </ref> ; thus under Religious Zionism the Jewish nation is conceived of as an “organic unity”, whereas Modern Orthodoxy emphasises the individual <ref name="autogenerated2" />.

Applying the above distinction, in Israel today Modern Orthodoxy - as distinct from Religious Zionism - is represented by only a handful of institutions: the Religious Kibbutz Movement, ''Neemanei Torah V’Avoda'', the Meimad political party, and the Shalom Hartman Institute (some would include Yeshivat Har Etzion and Yeshivat Hamivtar / Ohr Torah Stone Institutions).

===Conservative Judaism===<!-- This section is linked from Conservative Judaism -->
In some areas, Modern Orthodoxy’s left wing appears to align with more traditional elements of Conservative Judaism, and in fact some on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have allied with the formerly Conservative Union for Traditional Judaism. Nonetheless, the two movements are completely distinct. Rabbi Avi Weiss - from the left of Modern Orthodoxy- stresses that Orthodox and Conservative Judaism are “so very different in … three fundamental areas: ''Torah mi-Sinai'', rabbinic interpretation, and rabbinic legislation” <ref name="autogenerated8">[http://www.yctorah.org/downloads/articles/aw-open-orthodoxy.pdf]</ref>.

Le terme '''orthodoxe moderne''' (anglais : '''modern orthodox''' ou MO), surtout employé dans le monde anglophone, désigne la fraction des juifs orthodoxes qui aspirent à une insertion aussi complète que possible dans la société, tout en restant dans le cadre de la halakha telle qu’elle est définie par ce courant. Leur mode de vie se rapproche de celui de la fraction la plus traditionnaliste du mouvement Massorti, dont ils tiennent néanmoins à se distinguer. En effet, pour les orthodoxes modernes, les décisions rabbiniques ne doivent pas remettre en question les opinions cumulées du ''Choulhan Aroukh'' et des Aharonim successifs, alors que les Massorti ont vis-à-vis de la loi juive une latitude d’interprétation plus large. 

A l’opposé du pôle ultra-conservateur de l’orthodoxie, qui voit le monde moderne et séculier comme corrompu et cherche à s’en isoler, ils attachent une valeur positive au contact avec ce monde, en particulier selon la perspective de sa « réparation », n’exceptant que quelques domaines fondamentalement irréconciliables. Ils ne cherchent pas à éviter outre mesure le contact avec les non-Juifs et les autres courants du judaïsme. Ils accordent de la valeur au savoir non religieux et aux sciences, au-delà de la simple nécessité professionnelle. Ils optent plus souvent pour l’observation moins sévère (''kulas'') de la loi. Ils soutiennent l'État juif et constituent le seul courant orthodoxe au sein duquel ont peut trouver des opinions favorables à l’élargissement de la participation religieuse féminine, voire des courants féministes. 

Bien que la plupart du temps revendiqué, le terme ''orthodoxe moderne'' est parfois utilisé par dérision par les autres membres de l’orthodoxie pour stigmatiser les mauvais observants.

Les orthodoxes modernes se réfèrent souvent aux figures et concepts suivants : 
*Le rabbin Azriel Hildesheimer (1820-1899) : croyant à l’harmonie possible entre judaïsme et science, il fonda des établissements d’enseignement incorporant dans leur programme des connaissances académiques non religieuses, dont le ''Rabbiner Seminar für das Orthodoxe Judenthum'', l’une des premières yeshivot de ce type, ainsi que des établissements scolaires pour les deux sexes. Il agissait volontiers en coopération avec d’autres courants du judaïsme, en particulier en faveur de l’État juif.
*La philosophie Torah im Derech Eretz ( [suivre] la Torah selon les voies du pays [de résidence] ) du rabbin Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808-1888), qui pensait qu’il était possible de s’impliquer dans des domaines non religieux en leur appliquant la philosophie de la Torah, les sacralisant ainsi. Néanmoins, les héritiers directs de Hirsch sont les ''néo-orthodoxes'' plus stricts, qui ne se reconnaissent pas dans le mouvement orthodoxe moderne.
*La philosophie Torah u-Madda (Torah et connaissances séculières), soutenue en particulier par le rabbin Joseph Soloveitchik (1903-1993), directeur académique de Yeshiva University, promeut une synthèse personnelle entre science, démocracie et judaïsme orthodoxe.
*Le rabbin Abraham Isaac Kook (1864 – 1935), inspirateur du sionisme orthodoxe.
