The '''Byzantine-Seljuk wars''' were a series of decisive battles that shifted the balance of power in Abassid Caliphate in the Levant, North Africa and Asia Minor. 

Today the theme system. Even after Manzikert Byzantine rule over Asia Minor did not end immediately, nor were any heavy concessions levied by the Turks on their opponents &mdash; it took another 20 years before the Turks were in control of the entire Anatolian peninsula and not for long either.

During the course of the war, the Seljuk Turks and their allies attacked the Mongols, leading to the rise of the ghazis and the conclusive Byzantine-Ottoman wars.

== Origins ==

The wars' distant origins lay in the formation of the Byzantine Empire from the collapsing Roman Empire in the 4th century AD. Prior to the formation of the Byzantine realm in the 3rd century AD, the Roman Empire faced a severe military and political crisis; political assassinations and dangerous campaigning led to 32 Emperors seizing and losing power within 50 years of Roman history.<ref></ref> Matters were made worse with an economic and demographic problem.The population of the Roman Empire began to fall in the 4th century AD due to a lack of conquest leading to a lack of slaves,<ref> </ref> a vital and significant group of people in the Empire. Reforms by Emperors like Constantine the Great and Theodosius I prolonged the Roman Empire but nonetheless the Empire split into Eastern and Western Halves in 395 AD.<ref></ref> The Western Half (Western Roman Empire) was plagued by barbarian invasions, collapsing in 476 AD whilst the Eastern Half survived and began to undergo Hellenization<ref> </ref> transforming into what historians label today as the Byzantine Empire. Unlike the Western Half of the Roman Empire, the Eastern Half experienced fewer barbarian invasions although encounters with the Huns and Persians kept the Byzantines busy enough from making any serious recovery attempts in the West.

In the 7th and 8th centuries, the Byzantines experienced several co-ordinated Arab invasions losing several vital provinces, such as Egypt and the Levant. A Byzantine resurgence under the Macedonian Dynasty allowed the Byzantines to reconquer parts of Syria and Mesopotamia; in particular were the efforts of Basil II who from the late 10th century to early 11th century transformed the Empire into the most powerful state in the Medieval World.<ref></ref>

Despite this, the Byzantines were far from safe. With the death of Basil II came a series of Emperors whom failed to secure the Empire against external threats. The biggest threat to the Empire since the Arab invasions were the Turks. The Turks were much like the Byzantines former enemies, the Huns. Combining their excellent riding skills with Islamic zeal, the Turks who converted to Islam in the 7th and later 8th centuries<ref></ref> were to become a formidable enemy to a Christian state in decline. 

As the Byzantines were making headway against the Arabs in the 10th century, Persia was being ruled by the Ghaznevids, another Turkic people. The Migration of Seljuk Turks into Persia in the 10th century led to the Ghaznevids being overthrown. There they settled and adopted Persian language and customs.<ref></ref>
The Seljuks established a powerful domain and captured Baghdad in 1055 from the Abassid Caliphate. The Abassid Caliphate henceforth became a mere figurehead in the Islamic World. The Seljuk Turks, spurred on by their previous success, now launched an attack on the Levant and against Fatimid Egypt, which lost Jerusalem in 1071.<ref> </ref>

Encounters between the Seljuk Turks and the Byzantines did not occur until after the reign of Basil II. However, the outcome of another war, the Byzantine-Georgian wars was in some ways influenced by the incursions of the Seljuk Turks into Georgia,<ref> </ref><!-- We might have self reference issue here--> so it is unlikely that they were unheard of.

When the Seljuk Turks did encounter the Byzantines, they had chosen a good time to attack; Byzantium was faced with weak rule, Norman conquests<ref> </ref> and the schism whilst the Abassid Caliphate had recently been seriously weakened with its wars against the Fatimid dynasty.<ref> </ref>

==Initial Conflicts: 1064-1071==

Ever since the early 11th century, the Seljuk Turks from central Asia had been expanding westward,<ref> </ref> defeating various Arab factions and occupying the Abassid caliphate's power base in Baghdad.<ref></ref> At the same time, the Byzantine empire was making a few gains in Edessa and Syria.<!-- The following is a copy of relevant wikipedia article ++<ref>http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Cities/EdessaMesopotamia.html</ref> --> In 1067 the Seljuk Turks invaded Asia Minor attacking Caesarea and in 1069 Iconium.<ref>Philip Sherrard, ''Great Ages of Man Byzantium'', Time-Life Books, p. 164</ref> A Byzantine counter attack in 1069 drove the Seljuk Turks back from these lands.<ref>http://navsci.berkeley.edu/ma20/PPT/14%20Feb%2006%20Byzantine.ppt.
</ref> Further offensives by the Byzantine army drove the Turks back across the Euphrates. 

Despite this, the Seljuk Turks continued their incursions into Asia Minor, capturing Manzikert. The Byzantine Emperor Romanus Diogenes led an army in an attempt to score a decisive blow against the Seljuks and add some military justification to his rule (which had seen the loss of southern Italy to Norman conquests). During the march, Alp Arslan, the leader of the Seljuk Turks withdrew from Manzikert. His tactical withdrawal allowed his army to ambush the Byzantines, reclaiming Manzikert shortly after.<ref></ref> The victory itself led to few gains at the time for the Seljuk Turks, but the civil chaos that resulted in the Byzantine Empire allowed the Seljuk's and various other Turkic allies to swarm into Asia Minor.

==Turkic Conquests: 1071-1096==

After Manzikert, the Seljuk Turks concentrated on their eastern territorial gains which were threatened by the Fatimid dynasty in Egypt although Alp Arslan encouraged other allied Turks and vassals to establish Beyliks in Asia Minor.<ref>[http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/christian/blchron_xian_crusades01.htm Before of the Crusades - 350 - 1095 - Timeline of the Crusade: Christianity vs. Islam:<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Many Byzantines at the time did not see the victory as a total disaster and when the Turks began occupying the countryside in Anatolia they began to garrison the Byzantine cities as well, not as foreign conquerors but as mercenaries requested by various Byzantine factions &mdash; one Byzantine Emperor even gave the city of Nicaea's defense to the invading Turks in 1078.<ref></ref>

The result of the civil war meant that pretenders to the Byzantine throne sought Turkic aid by conceding Byzantine territory. The loss of these cities such as Nicaea and another defeat in Anatolia led to a prolongation of the war. The civil conflict finally ended when Smyrna were lost by 1084,<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9355511 Antioch - Britannica Concise Encyclopedia - The online encyclopedia you can trust!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Although between 1078 and 1084 the city had been in the hands of an Armenian renegade. By 1091, the few remaining Byzantine towns in Asia Minor inherited by Alexius were lost as well. However, all was not to end in defeat for Byzantium; in 1091, a combined Seljuk/Pecheneg invasion and siege of Constantinople was thoroughly defeated whilst the Norman invasions had been held back as well allowing the Empire to focus her energies against the Turks.

In 1094, Alexius Comnenus sent a message to Pope Urban II asking for weapons, supplies and skilled troops. At the Council of Clermont in 1095, the Pope preached a Crusade to be undertaken in order to capture Jerusalem and, in the process, assist the Byzantine Empire which could no longer guard Christendom in the East from Islamic aggression.<ref></ref> Though the Crusades would assist the Byzantine Empire in reconquering many vital Anatolian towns, it also led to the dissolution of the Empire in 1204 during which time the Byzantines struggled to hold on to their territories.

The first Crusaders arrived in 1096 following Alexius' appeal to the West.<ref></ref> The agreement between the Byzantines and the Crusaders was that any Byzantine cities re-captured from the Turks would be handed over to the Empire.<ref name="M40">Madden (2005), 40</ref>

This was beneficial for the Crusaders as it meant that they did not have to garrison captured towns and lose troop strength whilst maintaining their supply lines. The Byzantines, in return, would supply the Crusaders with food in a hostile territory and Alexius' troops would act as a reserve to reinforce them in any dangerous situations. The Crusaders first set about attacking Nicaea on Dorylaeum<ref>Rickard, J.

Unfortunately for Alexius Comnenus, the Byzantines were unable to fully capitalize on these conquests with Caesarea returning to the Seljuks as a part of the Sultanate of Rum along with several other cities such as Iconium, the future capital of the Seljuk Turks.
thumb|right|The siege of Antioch, with soldiers wearing plate as opposed to mail armour.Following these victories, the Crusaders went on to lay siege to Antioch a city under Turk occupation. The siege marked the end of Crusader assistance to the Byzantines due to the simulations of Stephen of Blois. Kerbogah, a vassal of the Seljuk Turks, had a huge army of 75,000 troops sent to relieve Antioch; his unsuccessful siege of Edessa (a city that had recently fallen to the Crusaders) allowed the Crusaders time to capture Antioch on the June 3, 1098,<ref name="M42-43">Madden (2005), 42-43</ref> a day before Kerbogah's arrival. Despite this, Kerbogah's troops were able to breach the citadel<ref name="M42-43" />  where vicious and desperate fighting allowed the Crusaders to repulse his offensive. At this point, one of the Crusaders present, Stephen of Blois deserted and reaching Alexius Comnenus warned him that the Crusaders were destroyed and so had the Byzantine Emperor turn back.<ref>Evans, Michael. "[www.suite101.com/article.cfm/crusades/84416 The Siege of Antioch]." Suite 101. 9 Nov. 2001. 2 June 2007.</ref>

With this resentment, the Crusaders largely abandoned assisting the Byzantines against the Seljuk Turks and their allies.

===John II Comnenus===

The death of Alexius I brought John II Comnenus to power. By now, the Seljuk Turks had fractured and became loosely allied to each other.<ref>[http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=Seljuk_empire The Seljuk Empire - All Empires<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During this time the Sultanate of Rum was busy fighting off their former allies, the Danishmends. John Comnenus was able to use this to his advantage as he undertook a series of campaigns aimed at recapturing Anatolia. Under his rule, the front line was pushed far into Anatolia, reaching dangerously close to his enemies' capital at Iconium. Despite this, the Turks in Anatolia continued to fight each other but a fatal hunting accident to the emperor John robbed the Byzantines of the opportunity to inflict a decisive victory.<ref>Stone, Andrew. "[http://www.roman-emperors.org/johncomn.htm An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors]." 26 Nov. 2004. University of Western Australia. 2 June 2007</ref>

===Manuel Comnenus===

John II died in 1143 while the Byzantine empire was very powerful. The new emperor, Manuel Comnenus, was unable to extend the front line past his father's achievements. The Seljuk Turks were able to subdue their enemies, the Danishmends under Kilij Arslan II.<ref>"[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Seljuks Seljuks]." Classic Encyclopedia. 1911. Encyclopedia Britannica. 2 June 2007.</ref> During this time, the Byzantines were also fighting the Danishmends as nominal allies of the Seljuks. Part of the agreement meant that captured Danishmend territory would go to the Byzantines. When Kilij Arslan refused, the Byzantines under Manuel Comnenus had an army sent which was repulsed with heavy losses to both sides in 1176 at the Battle of Myriokephalon.<ref>"[http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Labyrinth/2398/oocinfo/history/postmyrio.html Events After Myriokephalon]." Geocities. 2 June 2007.</ref>
thumb|right|300px|Byzantine territory in red, and the Sultanate of Iconium and Four Emirates in 1180 A.D. Due to the nature of the war and terrain, boundaries were constantly violated by raiding parties on both sides.
The battle was tactically indecisive with both leaders keen to seek peace. Following this Manuel's army continued to skirmish with the Turks in Anatolia, defeating them in a smaller but indecisive battle in the Meander Valley. Regardless of this small respite, Myriokephalon had far more decisive implications than the casualties would suggest &mdash; there was no more reconquest of Asia Minor under Manuel Comnenus after 1176 like that which occurred under his father's reign. For the Seljuks, the acquisition of Danishmend territory gave them a victory though once again the Seljuks had to contend with neighbouring disputes leading to the peace treaty as requested by both leaders. By the terms of the treaty, Manuel was obliged to remove the armies and fortifications posted at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum.

However, Manuel Komnenus refused and when Kilij Arslan tried to enforce this treaty, John Vatatzes, who was sent by the Emperor to repel the Turkish invasion scored a victory over the Turks at the Charax, allowing the Turks to capture many livestock.<ref name="Stone">A. Stone, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/mannycom.htm Manuel I Comnenus]</ref> The city of Claudiopolis in Bithynia was besieged by the Turks in 1179, forcing Manuel to lead a small cavalry force to save the city and then, even as late as 1180, the Byzantines succeeded in scoring a victory over the Turks.<ref name="Stone">A. Stone, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/mannycom.htm Manuel I Comnenus]</ref>

However, the continuous warfare did have a serious effect upon Manuel's vitality; he declined in health and in 1180 succumbed to a slow fever. Furthermore, like Manzikert, the balance between the two powers began to gradually shift &ndash; Manuel never again attacked the Turks and, after his death, they began to move further and further west, deeper into Byzantine territory.

==Byzantine Collapse 1180 - 1308==

The death of Manuel I Comnenus in 1180 did not end the Komnenoi dynasty, but Manuel's son proved to be incapable of holding together an empire burdened with heavy expenditure thanks to his father's extensive campaigning. In 1183, Alexius II Comnenus was deposed and replaced by Andronikus II Comnenus. His attempts to continue the militarization of the empire led to his torture, blinding, 3 days of public humiliation and finally death in 1185.<ref name="Norwich294"></ref> Even the Komnenoi proved fallable - Sozopolis, Ankara and Heraclea all fell to Alp Arslan, reaping the benefits of Myriokephalon at long last.

De '''Byzantijs-Seltsjoeken oorlogen''' waren een reeks van belangrijke veldslagen die de macht over Byzantijnen naar de Seltsjoeken. Terwijl ze elkaar bevochten hadden beide te maken met grote onrust binnen hun eigen grenzen, vooral wanneer ze een nederlaag hadden gelegen.

== Wat vooraf ging ==
Het Oost Romeinse Rijk bleef echter bestaan en veranderde steeds meer in een Grieks rijk in plaats van Latijns, het "nieuwe" Griekse rijk wordt door geschiedkundigen aangeduid als het Byzantijnse Rijk. Vanaf het einde van de 10e eeuw tot het begin van de 11e hadden de Byzantijnen succes met het terugdringen van invallen en ze wisten een sterk rijk neer te zetten onder Basileios II in 1025.
right|thumb|250px|Het Seltsjoekenrijk bij de dood van Malik Sjah in [[1092.]]

In de 9e en 10e eeuw waren Turkse volkeren bekeerd tot de islam. De dynastie van de Seltsjoeken stichtte een sterke staat in Centraal-Azië. De Seltsjoeken trokken in het begin van de elfde eeuw op naar het Midden-Oosten. In 1055 veroverden zij Bagdad, de hoofdstad van het Arabische kalifaat. 

Aanvaringen tussen de Seltsjoeken en de Byzantijnen vonden pas plaats na de regeerperiode van Basileios II toen de Byzantijns-Georgisch oorlogen waren beslecht in het voordeel van het Byzantijnse Rijk, mede door Seltsjoekse aanvallen op Georgië.

De Seltsjoeken hadden een goede tijd om aan te vallen. Het Byzantijnse Rijk had te maken met een zwakke heerschappen, de verovering van Sicilië door de Noormannen en de Schisma, terwijl de kalifaat aanzienlijk was verzwakt door haar oorlogen tegen de Fatimiden en de Byzantijnen.

==1064-1071==

thumb|250px|right|Byzantijnse Rijk in 1071. De westelijke delen waren verloren aan de Noormannen terwijl de Seltsjoeken de macht in Syrië overnamen.
De Seltsjoeken onder leiding van Toghrül Beg hadden sinds het begin van de 11e eeuw hun gebied vanuit Centraal-Azië richting het westen uitgebreid. Hierbij versloegen ze verschillende Arabische stammen. In 1055 veroverden zij Bagdad, de hoofdstad van het kalifaat. Toghrül Beg heerste als wereldlijk heerser waarbij hij de geestelijke autoriteit van de Abbasidische kaliefen bleef erkennen. 

De Byzantijnen sloegen terug en zij wisten hun gebied uit te breiden in Edessa en Syrië. Later, in 1067 vielen de Seltsjoeken Caesarea in de Slag bij Caesarea aan en in 1069 Iconium (Konya). 

Een Byzantijnse tegenaanval in 1069 dreef de Seltsjoeken weg van deze gebieden. Andere aanvallen door de Byzantijnen wisten de Seltsjoeken terug te dringen over de Eufraat. 

De Seltsjoeken onder leiding van Alp Arslan versloegen de Byzantijnen in de Slag van Manzikert en daarmee lag Klein-Azië voor hen open.

==1071-1096==

thumb|right|250px|Byzantijnse Rijk in [[1081.]]
Na Manzikert concentreerden de Seltsjoeken zich op hun gebieden in Centraal-Azië. Alp Arslan werd in 1072 gedood nabij de rivier de Oxus. Na diens dood kwam Malik Sjah I aan de macht en ook hij zou het rijk van de Seltsjoeken sterk uitbreiden.
