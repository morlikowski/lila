'''''Electric Circus''''' est le 5 album de Pop. Si les critiques ont plutôt félicité l'originalité de l'album, les fans de Common ne l'ont pas du tout suivi et l'album n'a pas eu le succès de son précédent opus, ''Like Water For Chocolate''.

Cet album est le 2 et dernier album de Common sorti chez MCA Records.

Lonnie "Pops" Lynn, qui apparaît sur une chanson, est le père de Common.

'''''Electric Circus''''' is an album by Common, released in December Like Water for Chocolate''.  An eclectic album, it features fusions of several genres such as Pop, Rock, Electronic, and Geffen.

== Overview ==
Common worked with a large (and eclectic) number of musicians on ''Electric Circus''. Among them were Bilal and hip hop genre in a similar fashion to Phrenology'' (2002) and Common for a duet on ("Jimi Was A Rock Star"), which is a dedication to Jimi Hendrix.

The second Neptunes collaboration on the record, the cross-genre "I Got A Right Ta", is a musical departure from the styles of both artists, and features blues-inspired style.  A triumphant sounding Common proclaims himself "the only cat in hip hop that can go into a props".  The song was placed on the B-Side of "Come Close". 

"Between Me, You & Liberation", in which Common discusses sexual abuse and its effects on a young woman, confronting his homophobia after learning about the sexuality of a longtime friend, and the loss of a relative to cancer, contains themes wholly unusual for a rap song, and  is perhaps, the rapper's most vulnerable moment on record.<ref name="Emcees Without Voices">{{cite web

Following ''LWFC'''s tributes to Fela Kuti, and Assata Shakur, ''Electric Circus'' pays homage to someone altogether more familiar (Jimi Hendrix) on "Jimi Was A Rock Star".  The 8 minute-plus song is a duet between Common and his then-girlfriend Erykah Badu, which gradually builds up into its cryptic, chanting finale. This song is Common's first all-singing performance.

The center-piece of the album, the epic "Heaven Somewhere", features 6 vocalists who all give insight into what their interpretation of Heaven is. Common's father Lonnie Lynn ends the affair by saying: 

:''Heaven is being pops''
:''heaven is spending the day with your grandchildren''
:''listenin' to they voices and they laughing and play''
:''and then at the end of the day we hug we kiss and slowly they walk away''
:''and then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me round the knees''
:''yeah, that's heaven to me''

In an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Common admitted:

== Reception ==
The album's style tended to divide critics; most praised its ambitious vision while some criticized it for the same reason. Most of the criticism tended to revolve around the albums experimental nature. Some felt Common had strayed too far from his previous sound.  Longtime Common fans also viewed his relationship with Erykah Badu as having an overly experimental influence on him.  

Official reviews, however, were mostly positive.  "Pushing past the accepted boundaries of contemporary black pop" is how Pop Matters described the album.<ref name="Pop Matters">[http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/c/common-electric.shtml PopMatters]</ref>  Likewise, Play Louder agreed calling it "a brilliant, visionary album",<ref name="Playlouder.com">[http://playlouder.com/review/+679common/ PlayLouder.com]</ref> as did Rolling Stone who saw it as "breaking hip-hop rules with a freewheeling fearlessness".<ref name="Rolling Stone">[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/common/albums/album/213002/review/6068234/electric_circus Rolling Stone]</ref> Ink Blot Magazine's Matt Cibula called it his "favorite record of 2002".<ref name="Ink Blot Magazine">[http://www.inkblotmagazine.com/rev-archive/Common_Electric_Circus.htm Ink Blot Magazine.com]</ref>
