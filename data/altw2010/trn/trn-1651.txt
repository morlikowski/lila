'''Ankhesenamon''' fou una reina egípcia, filla d'Akhenaton probablement amb la seva dona '''Ankhesenpaaton''' (Ankhesenpaaten). El seu nom de naixement fou Ankhesenpaaton i per distingir-la de la mare fou anomenada Ankhesenpaaton Tasherit (la jove). A les cròniques hitites es coneguda com '''Dahamunzu''', probablement un títol més que el nom.

Quan Tutankhaton va pujar al tron hi fou casada. El faraó tenia uns 9 anys i probablement la núvia en tenia pocs més. El matrimoni va canviar el seu nom (de un final amb Aton a un final en Amon) el segon any, moment en què el culte exclusiu d'Aton fou abolit.

Pel seu origen patern, i com a filla més gran d'Akhenaton, tenia dret al tron en cas de manca de mascles. A la prematura mort de Tutankhamon el va succeir en el tron i els seus ministres, especialment el visir Ay, li van indicar que hauria de triar marit. El mateix Ay segurament es va proposar com a candidat, però la reina era jove (uns 20 anys o poc mes) i Ay era ja gran i li va donar llargues.

Ankhesenamon va escriure a Subiluliuma I demanant un fill per casar-hi i esdevenir faraó; el rei hitita, que era davant Kargamis, segurament va quedar molt sorprès i va enviar a comprovar la seva veracitat a Hattusazit, el camarlenc reial. Al cap d'unes setmanes o mesos va retornar el camarlenc Hattusaziti amb un enviat egipci anomenat Hani. Convençut el rei va declarar l'establiment de la pau entre Hatti i Egipte i va enviar un dels seus fills, anomenat Zannanza (alguns erudits pensen que mes que el nom del príncep es tractaria del seu títol egipci), per casar amb la vídua de Tutankhamon. Però en el camí Zannanza fou assassinat segurament per un partit antihitita egipci que preferia veure al tron al visir Ay o al general Horemheb (els dos son sospitosos de ser els instigadors). Aquest fets van originar la guerra entre Egipte i els hitites.

Born as '''Ankhesenpaaten''' (c. 1348 – after 1324 B.C.) and later renamed, '''Ankhesenamen''', which means. ''She who lives through the Amun'', was the third of six known daughters of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten and his Great Royal Wife Nefertiti.<ref name="dodson148"></ref> The change in her name reflects the changes in Ancient Egyptian religion during her lifetime after her father's death. Her youth is well documented in the ancient reliefs and paintings of the reign of her parents.  

She was probably born in year 4 of Akhenaten's reign and by year 12 of her father's reign she was joined by her three younger sisters. He made his wife his co-regent and had his family portrayed in a realistic style in all official artwork. 

Ankhesenamen was definitely married to one king -- she was the Great Royal Wife of pharaoh Tutankhamum (who may have been her half-brother). It is also possible that she was briefly married to Tutankhamun's  successor, Ay.<ref name="Grajetzki64"></ref> It has also been posited that she may have been the great royal wife of her father, Akhenaten, after the possible death of her mother and co-regent of Akhenaten's immediate successor, Smenkhkare, who now is thought to have been a woman.

==Early life==

Ankhesenpaaten was born in a time when Egypt was in transition (c. 1348 BC). Her father had abandoned the old deities of Egypt in favor of the Aten, a minor sun-god who was the physical Sun Disk. 

She is believed to have been born in Waset (present-day Thebes), but probably grew up in her father's new capital city of Akhetaten (present-day Amarna). The three eldest daughters – Meritaten, Meketaten, and Ankhesenpaaten – became the "Senior Princesses" and participated in many functions of the government and religion.

==Later life==

She is believed to have been married first to her own father,<ref></ref> and is thought to have been the mother of the princess Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit (possibly by her father or by Smenkhkare) when she was twelve, although the parentage is unclear.<ref name="dodson148"/>  

After her father's death and a presumed short marriage to restored religion by changing their names to Tutankhamen and Ankhesenamen.<ref name="slu"></ref> The couple appear to have had two stillborn daughters, although there is no evidence of their relationship to the remains found in Tutankhamun's tomb.<ref name="slu"/> Some time in the ninth year of his reign, at about the age of eighteen, Tutankhamen died suddenly leaving Ankhesenamen alone without an heir at about age twenty-one.<ref name="slu"/> 

A ring shows that Ankhesenamen married queen.  She probably died during or shortly after his reign and as of yet no burial has been found for her.

==The Hittite Letters==
A document was found in the ancient Hittite capital of Hattusa which dates to the Amarna period. It was addressed to the Hittite king, Suppiluliuma I, and reads;

<blockquote>
''"My husband has died and I have no son. They say about you that you have many sons.  You might give me one of your sons to become my husband. I would not wish to take one of my subjects as a husband... I am afraid."''<ref name="manley"></ref>
