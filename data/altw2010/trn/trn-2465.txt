==反响==

作为英国长寿剧以及英国文化的代表作《異世奇人》的衍生劇集，《火炬木小组》开播后被媒体天花乱坠的宣传报道。它进入了英国流行文化，并且收到很多正负面的评价。人们尤其关注的是其分级为'''成人级'''，以及剧中人物性格塑造和性的描绘。《火炬木小组》起初赢得了收视率最高纪录，<ref></ref> 后来收视率有所下跌，<ref>[http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?RequestTimeout=500&report=weeklytop30 Weekly Multichannel Top 10 programmes], ''BARB''. Accessed 7 December 2006</ref> 但其不俗的收视率还是孕育了《火炬木小组》第二輯。

2007年4月的威尔士电影电视艺术颁奖会上，《火炬木小组》打败了《異世奇人》，赢得了'''最佳电视剧獎'''。这个奖项由英国电影电视艺术学士院威尔士分部所授予，表彰在威尔士电影电视制作上所取得的成就。其中女主角Eve Myles获得最佳女演员奖，打败了《異世奇人》的女主角Billie Piper。<ref name="cymru"></ref> 

==主题==

火炬木小组在其故事情节中探索了不少主题，特别是LGBT主题。许多角色都被描绘成非固定性取向，通过这些角色，该剧讨论了同性恋、双性恋的感请和苦恼。虽然情节中没有赤裸裸的讨论他们性取向的多变性，但是其中的角色Jack、Ianto以及Toshiko都在性取向上表现出多样性。

通过在主线剧情的描述以及人物身上的相似之处，本剧还探究了存在主义。

'''''Torchwood''''' is a British science fiction spin-off from the 2005 revival of the long-running science fiction programme ''interlinked.

The programme is produced in-house by BBC Wales, where Head of Drama at that time Julie Gardner serves as executive producer alongside Davies. The first two episodes of Series 1 of ''Torchwood'' premiered on 22 October 2006 on BBC Three and BBC HD. Series 2 premiered on BBC Two and BBC HD on 16 January 2008.<ref name="RadioTimes">{{cite web | url = http://www.radiotimes.com/ListingsServlet?event=10&channelId=105&programmeId=72170875&jspLocation=/jsp/prog_details_fullpage.jsp

==Overview==
In 2002, before the revival of ''Doctor Who'', Russell T. Davies began to develop an idea for a science-fiction/crime drama in the style of American dramas like ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Angel''.<ref name="buffy">{{cite news

}}</ref><ref name="walker"></ref> This idea, originally titled ''Excalibur'', was abandoned until 2005, when BBC Three Controller Stuart Murphy invited Davies to develop a post-watershed science-fiction series for the channel.<ref name="walker" />  During the production of the 2005 series of ''Doctor Who'', the word "Torchwood" (an rushes' tapes to ensure they were not intercepted.<ref></ref> Davies connected the word "Torchwood" to his earlier ''Excalibur'' idea and decided to make the series a ''Doctor Who'' spin-off.<ref name="walker" />  Subsequently, the word "Torchwood" was seeded in ''Doctor Who'' episodes and other media which aired in 2005 and 2006.

The series is set in Tooth and Claw"). To paraphrase Torchwood Three's commander-in-chief, Captain Jack Harkness, the organisation is separate from the government, outside the police, and beyond the United Nations. Their public perception is as merely a 'special ops' group. The events of the first series take place some time after the ''Doctor Who'' series two finale, in which Torchwood's London headquarters was destroyed, and just before the series three finale. 

The main writer alongside Davies is Chris Chibnall, creator of the BBC light drama show ''Born and Bred''. Other writers include P.J. Hammond, Toby Whithouse, ''Doctor Who'' script editor Helen Raynor, Cath Tregenna, and ''Doctor Who'' cast member Noel Clarke, who gained acclaim for his screenplay for the film ''Kidulthood''. Russell T. Davies wrote just the first episode.<ref name="sfx"></ref><ref name="DWM368">{{cite journal

In a 17 October 2005 announcement, Stuart Murphy described Torchwood as "sinister and psychological...As well as being very British and modern and real." Davies further described it as "a British sci-fi paranoid thriller, a cop show with a sense of humour. [...] Dark, wild and sexy, it's ''The X-Files'' meets ''This Life''." <ref>
</ref><ref></ref> Davies later denied ever making this comparison, instead describing the show as "alleyways, rain, the city".<ref></ref> 
As ''Torchwood'' is a post-watershed show — that is, after 9 p.m. — it has more mature content than ''Doctor Who''. Davies told ''SFX'': "We can be a bit more visceral, more violent, and more sexual, if we want to. Though bear in mind that it's very teenage to indulge yourself in blood and gore, and ''Torchwood'' is going to be smarter than that. But it’s the essential difference between BBC One at 7 pm, and BBC Three at, say, 9 pm. That says it all — instinctively, every viewer can see the huge difference there." <ref name="sfx"/>
According to Barrowman:
: "I don't do any nude scenes in series one; they're saving that for the next series! I don't have a problem with getting my kit off. As long as they pay me the right money, I'm ready to get out my cock and balls." <ref name="metro2">{{cite news

Davies also joked to a BBC Radio Wales interviewer that he was "not allowed" to refer to the programme as "''Doctor Who'' for grown-ups".<ref></ref> The first series includes content never before seen or heard in the ''Doctor Who'' franchise, including lovemaking scenes (in episodes such as "Day One" and "Out of Time"), same-sex kissing in a romantic/sexual context, and use of extreme profanity in several episodes.

BBC Three described ''Torchwood'' as the centrepiece of their autumn 2006 schedule.<ref></ref>

==Cast and crew==

thumb|left|250px|The series two cast, including special guest star [[Freema Agyeman as Martha Jones]]

''Torchwood'', unlike its parent programme, centres on a team instead of a single character and companion(s). The show is oriented on Torchwood Three, the Cardiff branch of the Torchwood Institute, tasked (among other things) with keeping an eye on the space/time Rift that runs through the city, and on whatever washes through it. Torchwood Three is a team of five operatives, led by point-of-view character for the viewer. Aside from the team, one recurring character is Rhys Williams (PC Andy Davidson (Tom Price), Gwen's former police partner and occasional comic relief.

Prior to the programme's debut, publicity materials prominently featured Suzie Costello among the other regular cast members, giving the impression that she would appear beyond the first episode. However, Suzie was unexpectedly killed off at the end of the first episode.  The character reappeared once more in the role of a villain.

Other characters who have appeared in more than one episode include Lisa Hallett, and Diane Holmes. Toward the end of the first series, the character of Bilis Manger was introduced as a villain. Weevils and Blowfishes. Toshiko's mother, portrayed by Noriko Aida, appears once in each series. ''Reset" onwards) before returning to ''Doctor Who'' midway through its fourth series.  Another guest star in ''Torchwood''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s second series is former ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'' star Captain John Hart, a villainous Time Agent and Jack's former lover. Introduced in the episode "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", he reappears later in the series finale, forced to do Jack's brother Gray's vengeful will; he reforms when he escapes from Gray's influence.<ref>''[http://www.afterelton.com/node/6096 John Barrowman rocks the TCA house] ''AfterElton.com</ref><ref>''[http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2007/07/spike-from-buff.html Spike from 'Buffy' and 'Torchwood's Captain Jack Harkness - Yowza!]'', little girl portrayed by child actress Skye Bennett, Dr. Angela Connolly portrayed by Golda Rosheuvel and 20th century Torchwood member Alice Guppy, portrayed by Amy Manson.

Richard Stokes produces ''Torchwood''. Originally, ''Doctor Who'' director James Hawes was lined up as producer. After directing the BBC Four drama ''The Chatterley Affair'', Hawes backed out of the project. Davies told ''Doctor Who Magazine'' that Hawes "has been having such a good time... that he's decided directing is his greatest passion, and as a result, he's stepped down." <ref name="DWM366">{{cite journal

The team's headquarters, referred to as ''the Hub'', is beneath Boom Town" and "Utopia" to refuel, and is the location of the rift first seen in "The Unquiet Dead". The Hub itself is around 3 stories high, with a large column running through the middle that is an extension of the fountain above (which in turn acts as an emergency escape route from the Hub) and at the base of which lies the rift machine.

The military base scenes in "Sleeper" and the booby-trapped abandoned warehouse scenes in "Fragments" were filmed at RAF Caerwent, near Chepstow, South Wales.

==Reception==

As a spin-off of long-running British cultural artifact ''Doctor Who'', ''Torchwood''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s launch into British popular culture has received much positive and negative review, commentary and parody following the hype of its inception, especially regarding its status as an "adult" ''Doctor Who'' spin-off as well as its characterisation and portrayal of sex. The series initially attracted record high ratings,<ref></ref> which later fell,<ref>[http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?RequestTimeout=500&report=weeklytop30 Weekly Multichannel Top 10 programmes], ''BARB''.
