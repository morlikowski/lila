Der '''Jaguar X350''' ist eine Oberklasselimousine der XJ-Reihe des britischen Automobilherstellers Jaguar.

Mit dem X350 (interne Werksbezeichnung) brachte Jaguar 2002 die dritte komplette Neukonstruktion der XJ-Serie auf den Markt. Eine Besonderheit ist dabei die Aluminiumkonstruktion der selbsttragenden Karosserie, die beinahe vollständig auf die bei anderen Herstellern anzutreffenden Strangpressprofile verzichtet. Die Karosseriebleche werden wie bei Flugzeugen mit Nieten verbunden. Zur zusätzlichen Versteifung ist an den Berührungsflächen ein spezieller Klebstoff aufgebracht. Das Leergewicht des Grundmodells ist mit 1.608 bis 1.728&nbsp;kg vergleichsweise niedrig. Die für Fahrzeuge dieser Klasse übliche Luftfederung wird von Thyssen-Krupp Automotive beigesteuert. Im Herbst 2004 kam eine Ausführung mit langem Radstand auf den Markt, propagiert mit Hilfe des Concept-Cars ''Concept 8''.

== Allgemeines ==
Für den X350 sind fünf Motoren verfügbar. Die Kraftübertragung erfolgt über ein Sechsgang-Automatikgetriebe des Herstellers ZF auf die Hinterräder. Die gegenwärtige Spitzenmotorisierung stellt der 4,2-Liter-V8 mit Kompressoraufladung dar. Im Herbst 2004 wurde ein in Kooperation mit PSA Peugeot Citroën entwickelter und bei Ford in Dagenham gebauter 2,7-Liter-V6-Biturbo-Dieselmotor als Einstiegsmotorisierung zum Motorenangebot hinzugefügt.

The '''Jaguar XJ''' is a luxury saloon sold under the British Jaguar luxury marque. The XJ was launched in 1968 and has served as the Jaguar flagship model for most of its production span which continues through to today. The original model was the last Jaguar saloon to have had the input of Sir William Lyons, the company's founder.

The '''XJ6''', using 2.8&nbsp;L (2790&nbsp;cc/170&nbsp;in³) and 4.2&nbsp;L (4235&nbsp;cc/258&nbsp;in³) XK engine, replaced most of Jaguar's saloons &ndash; which, in the 1960s, had expanded to four separate ranges. An upmarket version was marketed under the Daimler brand and called the '''Daimler version of the Jaguar 420. The "XJ" designation was from the car's code name during development, standing for ''Experimental Jaguar''. 

The car was introduced in September 1968. Power assisted steering and leather upholstery were standard on the 2.8 L 'De Luxe' and 4.2 L models and air conditioning was offered as an optional extra on the 4.2 L. Daimler versions were launched in October 1969, in a series of television advertisements featuring Sir William. In these spots, he referred to the car as "the finest Jaguar ever". In 1972 the option of a long wheel base version, providing a modest increase in leg room for passengers in the back, became available.

The '''XJ12''' version, featuring simplified grill treatment, and powered by a 5.3 L V12 engine (coupled to a Borg Warner Model 12), was launched, also in 1972:  3,235 of these first generation XJ12s were  built. Again, an upmarket version, this time called the '''Daimler Double-Six''', was available, reviving the Daimler model name of 1926-1938.

Normally known simply as the "Series II" (pronounced ''Series 2''), the XJ line was facelifted for 1973.  A 3.4&nbsp;L (3442&nbsp;cc/210&nbsp;in³) version of the XK engine was available from 1975. However, the 4.2-litre versions were the biggest sellers in the United Kingdom.

The XJ12 (and Daimler Double-Six) version, with a 5.3 L V12 engine, was again part of the line-up, along with long-wheelbase models (initially badged XJ6L and XJ 12L) and the XJ-C coupé, now considered a collector's item due to its rarity.

These Series II models were known for their poor build quality, which was attributed to Jaguar being part of the Lucas-sourced components.

Visually, apart from the optional longer wheelbase and available "XJ12" badge, the Series II cars are differentiated by rised front bumpoers to meet US crash safty regulations, which necessitated a smaller grille.  The interior received a substantial update, including simplified heating and a/c systems to address criticisms of the complex and not very effective Series I system.  91,227 were produced, 14,226 of them with the V12 engine.

Though worldwide production of the Series II ended in 1979, a number were produced in Cape Town, South Africa until 1981.

An 8,378-car run of 2-door XJ XJ-S, all ensured a small production run. 
    
All coupes came with a vinyl roof as standard. It has been speculated that this is due to the rough welds around the windows of the roof, however many owners have removed these roofs and found no such rough welds. Other explanations point out that all V12 Jaguars received vinyl roofs at this time to signify the introduction of fuel injection, but this doesn't explain the vinyl roof on the 6 cylinder cars. Today many XJ-Cs no longer have their vinyl roof, also removing the threat of roof rust.

A small number of Daimler versions of the XJ-C were made.

In late 1979 the XJ was facelifted again, and was known as the "Series III" (pronounced ''Series 3'').  The long-wheelbase version of the car incorporated a subtle redesign by Pininfarina, externally the most obvious changes over the SII were thicker, more incorporated rubber bumpers with decorative chrome only on the top edge, flush door handles for increased safety, 1 piece front door glass without a separate 1/4 light, the grille had only vertical vanes, the reverse lights moved from the boot plinth to the larger rear light clusters and a revised roofline with shallower glass area. There were three engine variants including the 5.3L V12, the 4.2L straight 6 and 3.4L straight 6. The larger 6-cylinder, and V12 models incorporated Bosch fuel injection (made under license by Lucas) while the smaller 6-cylinder was carbureted. The smaller 3.4L 6-cylinder engine was not offered in the U.S. The short wheelbase saloon and coupé had been dropped during the final years of the Series II XJ. The introduction of the Series III model also saw the option of a sunroof and cruise control for the first time on an XJ model.

The 1979 UK model range included the Jaguar XJ6 3.4 & 4.2, XJ12 5.3, Daimler Sovereign 4.2, Daimler Vanden Plas 4.2, Daimler Double-Six 5.3 and Daimler Double-Six Vanden Plas 5.3. 

In 1981 the 5.3 V12 models received the new Michael May designed 'fireball' high compression cylinder head engines and were badged from this time onwards to 1983 as HE (High efficiency) models. Also in 1981 a top spec Vanden Plas model was introduced for the US market, a model designation still used today for the top-level XJ saloon in the US.

In 1982 the interior of the XJ underwent a minor update. A trip computer appeared for the first time and was fitted as standard on V12 models. A new and much sought-after alloy wheel featuring numerous distinctive circular holes was also introduced, commonly known as the "pepperpot" wheel.

In 1983 the Sovereign name was transferred from Daimler to a new top spec Jaguar model, the '''Jaguar Sovereign'''. The Vanden Plas name was also dropped at this time in the UK market, as the designation was used on top-of-the-range Rover-branded cars in the home UK market. Daimler models became the Daimler 4.2 and Double Six and were the most luxurious XJ Series III models, being fully optioned with Vanden Plas spec interiors.

The 1984 UK model range included the Jaguar XJ6 3.4 & 4.2, Sovereign 4.2 & 5.3, Daimler 4.2 & Double Six 5.3.

The last Series III XJ with a six-cylinder engine was produced in 1987.  Production of the Series III XJ continued until 1992 with the V12 engine. In 1992, the last 100 cars built were numbered and sold as part of a special series commemorating the end of production for Canada. These 100 cars featured the option of having a brass plaque located in the cabin. It was the original purchaser's option to have this plaque, which also gave a number to the car (such as No. 5 of 100, etc.), fitted to the glove box, to the console woodwork or not fitted at all. This  brass plaque initiative did not come from Jaguar in Coventry. It was a local effort, by Jaguar Canada staff and the brass plaques were engraved locally. 132,952 Series III cars were built, 10,500 with the V12 engine.

In total between 1968 and 1992 there were around 318,000 XJ6 and XJ12 Jaguars produced.

===XJ40 (1986–1994)===
Throughout the 1970s Jaguar had been developing "Project XJ40" which was an all-new model intended to replace the original (by now Series III) XJ6. Due to problems at British Leyland and the fuel crisis, the car was continually delayed. Proposals from Jaguar's in-house designers and Pininfarina were received. Eventually, it was decided an internal design would be carried through to production.

This car was finally released in October 1986 with (in European markets) controversial square headlamps on all but the lowest specification; these were a lingering feature from the 1970s development. The car was considered more evolutionary than revolutionary, and had to fight off a new competitor: the recently enlarged BMW 7 Series (E32). While the British press favoured the Jaguar, the XJ40 tended to lose comparison tests run by German publications.  Only six-cylinder models were initially offered: a 2.9 L (in Europe) and a 3.6 L. The V12 (XJ12) and a long wheelbase model, including a high-roofed Daimler Majestic model (reviving the model name of 1958-1962) and destined for official use (one was used by the British prime minister), were again delayed, being launched at the very end of the XJ40's life.

The delay in fitting the V12 engine was due to the design of the engine bay which was too narrow to allow a V formation engine, said to have been designed deliberately in that fashion as the designers feared that their parent company would insist use of an engine based on their widely-used Ford in December 1989, work began on redesigning the engine bay to accommodate the V12. Ironically, thanks to Ford, Jaguar was later to find itself back in common ownership with another part of the old Rover family: Land Rover, where they had previously been thanks to British Leyland. However, having since developed their own more modern V8, they saw the reverse happen with a version of their engine fitted to Land Rover models, from which the old Rover V8 was finally dropped.

The single cam 2.9&nbsp;L V12 HE, but it proved to be underpowered and thirsty compared to the 3.6.&nbsp;L  Frequent timing chain failures were also a problem.  The engine was later replaced with the 3.2&nbsp;L, based on the durable 3.6&nbsp;L, which then became the 4.0&nbsp;L.

===XJ40 (1989–1994)===
In 1989, under Ford control, the model range was revised with the deletion of the 2.9&nbsp;L engine, replaced at the low end by a twin-cam 3.2&nbsp;L version. The 3.6&nbsp;L was upgraded to 4.0&nbsp;L. The most obvious interior improvement was replacement of the often unreliable digital dashboard with conventional analogue instruments. In 1994 the XJ6 received a passenger's side airbag which meant the loss of the in-dash glove box.

In 1989 and 1990 Jaguar Cars produced a special model of the XJ40 called the '''Majestic'''. All of these had maroon exteriors with special mesh wheels where the interior of the mesh was painted the same maroon colour as the exterior of the body, although the British prime minister had an armoured black ministerial Majestic. Inside there were autolux leather seats with contrasting piping along the edges. There may have only been 527 of the 1990 Majestics made.

===XJ81 (1993–1994)===
With the design alteration of the XJ40 engine compartment finally completed, the XJ81 or XJ12 saloon reached the market in 1993 and continued until the end of the 1994 model year.  The 1993 - 1994 XJ12 cars marked the introduction of the 6.0L V12 and four speed automatic transmission in the four door saloon. The new four speed automatic transmission in these cars was based on the GM 4L80E and featured an overdrive fourth gear for extended cruising comfort. The 1993 XJ12 cars that entered the United States were titled as 1994 cars. The primary differentiation between these early 1994 cars and the later 1994 cars is the presence of a in-dash glove box in the early cars that was replaced by a passenger's side airbag in the later 1994 cars. The V12 cars also had a latice or BBS style wheel and body coloured grille vanes. XJ-R versions of the XJ40 were produced; they featured upgraded suspension, engine and appearance, but lacked the supercharger of later XJRs. With numbers somewhere in the hundreds, they are quite rare and difficult to find.

With an all-new replacement still years away, in the early 1990s Jaguar recognised the boxy 1980s lines of the XJ40 needed to be facelifted and decided a "retro" path was the way forward. This path worked as Jaguar's biggest markets, the Americans, the Germans and the Japanese all associate Jaguars with sleek, voluptuous and taut feline curves. This revamp reintroduced many styling cues of the popular original XJ series. The X300, as it was known, was based on the XJ81 chassis, designed by chief Jaguar designer Geoff Lawson and was launched as the '''XJ6''' for the 1995 model year.

In addition, a  turbocharged Jaguar XJ220 sports car.

The centre section (namely the doors and glass area) was shared with the original "Mark 2" (XJ40/XJ81) but the X300 saw the XJ6 revert to a traditional fluted bonnet and 4 individual headlights. The front and rear wings, bumpers and bootlid were also redesigned. The interior remained more or less the same as before. The engines were basically the same 3.2&nbsp;L and 4.0&nbsp;L units (engine code AJ6) found in the XJ40, but were mildly revised to further increase power and refinement (engine code AJ16). It was this generation that saw continued improvement in build quality.

1997 was the final year of production for the XJ6. Jaguar switched exclusively to an all-new V8 engine when the '''XJ8''' (engine code AJ26) was introduced at the end of 1997 which fitted perfectly in the XJ81 chassis.

In September 1994, the XJ12 got the same styling revisions as the X300 XJ6. The 6.0&nbsp;L Jaguar V12 engine offered 318bhp and was continued for the 1995 model year mechanically unchanged from the 1994 XJ81 car. From 1995 on, the engine used a distributorless Denso electronic management system. The XJ12 was visibly differentiated from the XJ6 not only by a badge on the boot lid, but also by a "V12" badge on each side of the central pillar. The X300 XJ12 was available in both short- and long-wheelbase forms, although in the North American market, the long-wheelbase version was only available with the 1996 model year. No 1997 MY XJ12s were sold in North America.

The last Jaguar to be powered by a V12 engine was a black XJ12 which left the production line on BMW 750iL and Mercedes-Benz S600.

September 1997 saw the "Mark 2" XJ revised for a final time, and this time the car (known as X308) had changed more over the X300 than the X300 had done over the XJ40. The exterior styling was mildly revised, the only real notable changes being new, shallower grille, bumpers incorporating oval front indicators & side reflectors with 1/4 chrome trims instead of the full width ones of the X300, as well as revised clear indicator rear light clusers and the fitting of modern clear lens projector headlamps.

The biggest changes lay under the bonnet and inside.  An all-new, and hugely praised, V8 engine was introduced and was available in 3.2&nbsp;L, 4.0&nbsp;L and 4.0&nbsp;L supercharged versions. The new 8-cylinder engines, built in Bridgend, Wales, not only saw the temporary end of 6-cylinder and 12-cylinder power in an XJ, but the legendary XJ6 moniker was dropped(but later re-introduced in the 2003 X350; the cars with naturally-aspirated engines were now called XJ8. The new performance figures were  and  for the naturally-aspirated 4.0&nbsp;L and 3.2&nbsp;L versions respectively and 370 bhp (276&nbsp;kW) with  of torque for the supercharged version.
