'''Bodø Airport'''  (Norwegian: '''Bodø lufthavn''') is a main civilian airport in Bodø, Norway. It is located next to the military air force base Bodø Main Air Station, just south of the city centre, on the westernmost tip of the peninsula Bodø lies on. The airport has a single concrete, 2794 m x 45 m runway which runs in a roughly east-west direction. In addition to jet operations to Oslo, the airport serves as a hub for regional airline flights to Helgeland, Lofoten and Vesterålen. It served 1,430,000 passengers in 2006.  

==History==
Postal flights to Bodø started in 1921, and before 1940 Bodø was served with sea planes from Widerøe.

The first runway at Bodø Airport was build during British Gloster Gladiators landed and made out the first airborne defence for the city. The area was swampland, and the first makeshift runway consisted of wooden planks floating on the water. But soon the superior Luftwaffe seized control over the airport, and held it for the duration of the war, among other things upgrading the runway to concrete.

Not much was done with airport until the Korean War started in 1950. The West were afraid of a Soviet attack on Western Europe, so a new airfield was constructed at a new location southwest of the old one. Originally planned to be finished in 1951, the new airport didn't open until 1956, though the civilian bit opened in 1952. From then on fighter jets have been stationed at Bodø. In 1988 NATO injected vast amounts of money to enable the airfield to handle large air forces in the event of an emergency.

==Air force base==
''Main article: See Bodø Main Air Station''

The Bodø Main Air Station, situated near at the airport, is the biggest air station in Norway operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force. This air station is the home of the 331st and the 332nd Squadron of F-16s in addition to a detachment from the 330th Squadron of Westland Sea King helicopters.
