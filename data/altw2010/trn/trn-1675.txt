'''諾蘭曲線'''（'''Nolan Chart'''）是由美國自由黨。

諾蘭曲線以雙軸線的圖表標繪出各種不同的政治立場，以及他們所追求的政府形式。大衛·諾蘭認為一般的政治光譜測驗都只以一條軸線來假設右翼/保守主義與左翼/自由主義間的極端對比，根本無法清楚標示一個人的政治立場。諾蘭分析認為右翼/保守主義一邊的極端傾向增加經濟的自由而減少個人的自由，左翼/自由主義一邊的極端則傾向增加個人的自由而減少經濟的自由。諾蘭個人的政治觀點則是在擁護個人自由的同時也擁護經濟的自由，因此他認為這種圖表需要增加一條軸線才能正確反應他的政治立場。在這第二條軸線上，也能反應出那些傾向於同時減少個人自由和經濟自由兩者的人口。

==立場==

與一般傳統的左翼/右翼和其他政治分類圖表不同，諾蘭曲線有著二維的空間，水平的橫座標軸代表著「經濟自由」，而垂直的縱座標軸則代表了「個人自由」，如此一來便將人們的政治立場劃分為四個不同的象限。

左上角的象限代表了現代自由主義，或稱左翼政治—通常擁護較多的個人自由，並限制經濟上的自由。這一區塊的族群傾向於增加政府對貿易、商務的管制，但不支持對於言論自由、性議題、信仰和其他個人自由的限制。對經濟的限制可以是許多形式的，例如貿易壁壘、控制商業活動、環境保護法案、限制最低工資和酬勞的法規，以徵收稅賦來資助社會福利制度—尤其是針對那些富有企業和個人的財產徵稅。相反的，這一區塊的族群傾向於保護個人的自由，例如言論自由、隱私的權利、政教分離等等。由這部分族群所控制的政府通常會採取民主制度，但也會吸收小部分的自由意志主義、共產主義、社會主義、社群主義或社團主義。

右下角的象限代表了共和制度，但也會吸收小部分的自由意志主義、社團主義、法西斯主義、神權政治、寡頭政治或君主制。

右上角的象限代表了自由意志主義—同時擁護經濟自由和個人自由兩者。這一區塊的族群主張解除政府在幾乎所有事物上的管制，改由個人自身的責任和責任感來替代，並支持自由放任的政府。在他們的理想中，政府應該經由被統治的人民的同意，在管制的程度上只能以阻止某人做出傷害其他人生命、自由、或財產的行動為限。

左下角的象限則代表了諾蘭所描述的極權主義，或者更適當的描述是中央集權主義—主張限制經濟自由和個人自由兩者。這一區塊的族群傾向於由政府限制幾乎所有的事物，主張由政府嚴厲的控制個人和經濟。這種狀態的政府可以是許多形式的，例如独裁、神權政治、法西斯主義、社群主義、或者是無限制民主—缺乏憲法和選舉限制的政府。這些形式的政府可能採取非常極端的形式並採用嚴厲的政策，例如對產業和財產進行國有化、計畫經濟、鎮壓政治異議、鎮壓或滅絕種族或信仰上的少數族群、旅行限制、強烈監視個人行為、媒體和產業的審查制度等等。

==變化==

許多諾蘭曲線的變化版本發展出旋轉了45度角的菱形形狀，以他們平常慣用的圖表來代表左翼/自由主義和右翼/保守主義。許多人也對四個象限中所代表的政府使用了不同的名稱。

right|The Nolan chart, with the traditional left-right policial spectrum on the dashed diagonal
The '''Nolan Chart''' is a political diagram popularized by the American libertarian David Nolan. He created it to illustrate the claim that libertarianism stands for both left-wing "right-wing "conservatism," which, according to Nolan, advocates only economic freedom.

==Development==
While its exact origins appear to be unclear, the chart and its concept are commonly attributed to David Nolan. A similar bi-dimensional chart appeared in 1970 in ''The Floodgates of Anarchy'' <ref>  Sphere Books.  </ref> by Stuart Christie and Albert Meltzer,  with anarchism in the equivalent of the Nolan Chart's Left-Wing corner, fascism in the equivalent of the Right-Wing corner, "capitalist individualism" in the equivalent of the Libertarian corner and state communism in the equivalent of the Populist corner. 
In Radicals For Capitalism (p. 321), Brian Doherty traces the chart to an article by Maurice Bryson and William McDill in the Rampart Journal of Individualist Thought (Summer 1968) entitled "The Political Spectrum: A Bi-Dimensional Approach".

David Nolan first published the current version of the chart in an article called "The Case for a Libertarian Political Party" in the August The Individualist'', the monthly magazine of the Libertarian Party.

==Positions==
Differing from the traditional left/right distinction and other political taxonomies, the Nolan Chart in its original form has two dimensions, with a horizontal x-axis labeled "economic freedom" and a vertical y-axis labeled "personal freedom". It resembles a square divided into four quadrants, with each sample in the population assigned to one of the quadrants:

* Upper left &mdash; the political Left.  Favoring government that taxes more and spends more for activities such as welfare, Social Security and funding for homosexuality and illegality of the draft (which he labeled "high personal freedom"). 
* Bottom right &mdash; the political Right.  Those supporting high economic freedom and low personal freedom. Those on the Right want lower taxes and fewer social programs but support regulation by the government of cultural issues and personal behavior such as abortion and freedom of speech. 
* Top right &mdash; libertarianism.  David Nolan's own ideology, corresponding with high freedom in both economic and social matters. 
* Bottom left &mdash; the antithesis of libertarianism. David Nolan originally called this philosophy populism, but many later renditions of the chart have used the label authoritarianism or totalitarianism instead. Some critics have argued that this was an attempt to popularize the image of libertarianism as the "opposite" of ideologies with a rather negative public image, thus putting libertarianism itself in a good light. Communitarianism also exists within this quadrant.

==Variations==
Many variations of the Nolan Chart have been developed, with some rotating the chart area 45 degrees in a rhomboid form to allow representation of left/liberal and right/conservative along a single axis in the manner they are typically charted. Many use different labels to describe the various types of government that would be placed in the quadrants.

==Uses of the chart==

(see [http://freedomkeys.com/nolancharts.htm])

The advocates and writers of these quizzes are most often libertarian, and a common remark by them about their tests is that people who are libertarians inside and didn't know it will discover their true political leanings. The detractors of the Nolan Chart are most often people who accuse people with libertarian beliefs of using it to further their agenda and gain converts to their party and political movement. For example, the questions in such quizzes are often worded in such a way to encourage people to select the "libertarian" answer because all other answers are portrayed so negatively, or the answers meant to indicate a libertarian temperament are so vague or broad that one could easily agree with them while holding different views.

==Criticism==
Critics of this diagram (and this kind of chart in general) claim that it represents at best a pseudoscientific illustration of a political point of view. The essential premise of the diagram is for many an oversimplified generalization, one that is no real improvement over the unidimensional left-right or liberal-conservative scales; economic freedom and personal freedom are often inextricable, and both left-wing (Bakunin) and right-wing philosophers draw the same connection, though they have radically different views on the actual ''meaning'' of these types of "freedom." Corporate welfare, for example, is listed as a Leftist stance (since it falls under "low economic freedom"), yet it is often supported by the Right. Many libertarians would claim that this actually indicates that the political Left and Right are, in fact, very similar to each other despite their seemingly highly different positions. Critics argue that the libertarian views on personal and economic freedom may be a useful way of classifying ''libertarianism'' in relation to other ideologies, but they do not apply to the classification of those other ideologies in relation to each other.

The libertarian conception of freedom is perceived by some as tending toward anarchy. Others see it as driven by excessive individualism that actually detracts from social freedom. In essence, they claim the "chart" exists only to distance the term "libertarianism" from the older terms of anarchism and socialism, the latter of which draws polemic connections to communism, which itself draws polemic connections to totalitarianism.
