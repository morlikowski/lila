'''''Caligula''''' is a Penthouse'' founder Gaius Caesar Germanicus, better known as "Caligula". ''Caligula'' was written by financed by ''Penthouse'' magazine, and produced by Guccione and Franco Rossellini. It stars Malcolm McDowell as the Emperor.  ''Caligula'' remains the only major motion picture to feature eminent film actors (Sir John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole, Malcolm McDowell, Dame Helen Mirren) in a film with graphic and explicit sex.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/1999/11/30/caligula/print.html Salon Movies | Porn for thought<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Production==
Gore Vidal developed a ''Caligula'' screenplay from Roberto Rossellini's unproduced television media mogul and ''Penthouse'' founder and publisher Bob Guccione. (Vidal had been a frequent contributor to ''Penthouse''.)  Guccione agreed to finance the project on two conditions: that the film would be transformed into a flamboyant, luxurious spectacle akin to Hollywood's sword and sandal epics of the 1950s and 1960s; and that sex would be added to the script in order to promote Guccione's magazine. Both Vidal and Rossellini agreed and the ''Caligula'' project was launched.

Maria Schneider was originally cast as Caligula's doomed sister Drusilla, but later dropped out and was replaced by Italian director, was selected by Guccione to direct the film.  Guccione was impressed by Brass' previous work, the 1976 Salon Kitty'', which fused explicit sex with a big budget historical drama. ''Caligula'' production was housed in Dear Studios, Cleopatra'' was filmed thirteen years earlier. Shooting commenced in September 1976, with plans for a 1977 release.

However, from the start ''Caligula'' was plagued by difficulties. According to Guccione in a 1980 ''Penthouse'' magazine interview, Vidal (whom Guccione called a "prodigious talent") <ref name="autogenerated1" /> started trouble with a ''Time'' magazine interview in which he called directors parasites living off writers, and that the director need only follow the directions as provided by the author of the screenplay. According to Guccione, an enraged Brass responded to Vidal's comments by throwing Vidal out of the studio. Guccione was forced to side with Brass, (whom he called "a megalomaniac") because "Gore's work was basically done and Tinto's work was about to begin." <ref name="autogenerated1" /> 

Casting and logistical issues were also a problem. Uncomfortable with the sex and nudity in the script, the female lead Schneider quickly resigned from the film. <ref name="autogenerated3">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947822,00.html Will the Real Caligula Stand Up? - TIME<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It was also soon apparent to the filmmakers that the aggressive shooting schedule developed by the inexperienced Rossellini and Guccione was unrealistic for a film of such scope. Donati had to scrap some of his more elaborate original ideas for the sets and replace them with such surreal imagery as bizarre matte paintings, blacked-out areas, silk backdrops and curtains. This resulted in significant script changes, with Brass and the actors improvising scenes written to take place in entirely different locations, and sometimes shooting entirely new scenes (such as the frolicking scene that opens the film) in order to show progress while the incomplete or redone sets were unavailable. The production was also plagued by delays due to disagreements between Brass and Donati over Brass not using Donati's completed sets, <ref name="autogenerated1" /> 
as well as Brass and Guccione disagreeing over the sexual content of the film.  

Brass was similarly unhappy with Vidal's script. "It was the work of an aging arteriosclerotic.  Vidal redid it five times, but it was still absurd." <ref name="autogenerated3" /> With the help of McDowell, Brass rewrote some of the screenplay.

By the time the principal photography on ''Caligula'' had completed, Vidal (having a previous issue with his involvement in the infamous ''Myra Breckinridge'') was concerned about being associated with such an out-of-control production. Fearing the film would turn out incoherent, Vidal distanced himself from the project.  Of Vidal, Brass concluded, "If I ever really get mad at Gore Vidal, I'll publish his script." <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947822-2,00.html Will the Real Caligula Stand Up? - TIME<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

in the sex scenes instead of his Penthouse Pets.  Guccione hired friend Giancarlo Lui to re-edit the film. Lui was instructed to refashion the film into something more in keeping with what Vidal had first scripted, while delivering the sexual content demanded by Guccione.  In their most controversial move, the pair also shot extra scenes of hardcore sexual material <ref name="autogenerated2" /> which would be used to replace scenes shot by Brass.

With much footage improvised and rewritten from the original draft of the film, Lui further  scrambled, re-cut, and deleted scenes altogether. Many of the disturbing sexual images shot by Brass were removed, replaced by approximately six minutes of hardcore sex shot by Guccione and Lui.  In the end, the final cut of the film had strayed far afield from what Brass had intended. Ironically, perhaps, it bore little resemblance to what Vidal had scripted as well.

In the unpleasant aftermath, both Brass and Vidal launched independent tirades against the film and lawsuits against Guccione, delaying the release of ''Caligula''.  Vidal, who was paid $200,000 for his script, agreed to drop his contractual claim for 10% of the film profits in exchange for having his name removed from the title of the film (original billing was to have been ''Gore Vidal's Caligula''). <ref name="autogenerated1" /> In 1981, Penthouse Pet of The Year centerfold model who played Messalina, also sued Guccione, claiming that he damaged her career by using hardcore sexual scenes in the final cut of ''Caligula'' without her knowledge, thereby associating her unfairly with a pornographic film.  After a protracted litigation, in 1990 a New York state court awarded her $60,000 in compensatory damages and $4,000,000 in punitive damages. On appeal, the punitive damages were determined to be not recoverable and the court vacated the award. <ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I92_0250.htm Marjorie Lee Thoreson A/K/A Anneka Dilorenzo, Appellant-Respondent, V.

In late 1979, three years after production began, ''Caligula'' made its debut.

==Critical reaction==
The film was panned by critics;  Porn for thought<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  ''[[Newsweek'' magazine called ''Caligula'' "a two-and-one-half-hour cavalcade of depravity that seems to have been photographed through a tub of Vaseline." <ref name="autogenerated2" />

==Multiple versions==
''Caligula'' was shown in various versions, including:
*The unrated version, available in the American cinemas. This version contained significant  explicit sexual and violent content, including sex orgies, masturbation, fellatio, cunnilingus, anal fisting, male and female homosexuality, cross-dressing and transvestism, sibling incest, rape, male and female urination as well as scenes of  decapitation of prisoners by a giant "death machine" (A giant moving wall with lawn mower-like blades underneath it which is unlikely to have actually existed), infanticide, implied fratricide, penile castration and testicle castration. 

*The UK version, running 149 minutes. Aside from removing seven minutes of explicit footage, the editors included some replacement shots, derived from Brass' principal shoot, as well as some remainder footage from Guccione's re-shoots. It seems that the alternate footage was inserted carelessly, resulting in glaring continuity errors (especially obvious during the Rape of Prolucus & Livia and the Temple of Isis scenes.) This version is currently out-of-print, and will soon be replaced by the uncut version, which was finally granted classification in July 2008, 29 years after it's initial release. <ref>http://sbbfc.co.uk/Caligula_Case_Study.asp</ref>

*The rumored and infamous 210-minute unreleased version, shown in a private screening in Cannes, France (though not as part of the film festival). It might have been Russell Lloyd's (one of the original editors, before Giancarlo Lui took over the post-production) rough cut with a few reels of hardcore sex shot by Bob Guccione added in. No official copy of this version is believed to exist.

*Guccione eventually authorized an R-rated cut released in 1981, 105 minutes long, which earned the film a wider distribution. In this version the hardcore, bloody and violent footage was either trimmed or replaced with yet another set of alternate shots and angles. 

*In 1984, Franco Rossellini, unhappy with Guccione's final edit of the film, re-edited an extended, pre-release print of ''Caligula'', which may or may not have been the infamous 210 minute version. This new edition of the film, re-titled as ''Io, Caligola'' clocked in at 133 minutes and contained various minor scenes and shots not present in any other versions of the film, but the Italian censors had it cut down to only 86 minutes. However, after a public backlash, the film was restored to 123 minutes. The missing ten minutes are no doubt responsible for a few jump cuts that occur throughout the film. This version has been released on DVD, albeit available only in Italy.

O filme '''Calígula''' (no original, '''Caligola''') é uma produção ítalo-americana feita no final dos anos 70. Lançado em 1979 na Itália e em 1980 nos EUA, transformou-se numa das maiores polêmicas do cinema mundial, principalmente por suas cenas de sexo explícito.

==Sinopse==

O filme conta a história de Calígula, o mais louco dos imperadores romanos, que mantinha um bizarro caso sexual com sua irmã e era casado com uma prostituta. Ao mesmo tempo que Calígula vivia cercado de bajuladores, possuía também inimigos perigosos, que desejavam vê-lo distante do poder. "Calígula" é talvez um dos filmes mais controvertidos de todos os tempos. Com cenas de sexo explícito, de flagelação sadomasoquista e a encenação do processo de enlouquecimento gradativo do imperador, Calígula evoca as experiências cinematográficas de Pier Paolo Pasolini. No entanto, o que parece uma encenação gratuita revela-se um filme de grande alcance expressivo.

==Curiosidades==

* Foi lançada uma versão em comemoração aos 20 anos do filme que contém cenas adicionais inéditas, dirigidas por Bob Guccione criador da Revista Penthouse, um dos maiores nomes do erotismo mundial.

* No começo da década de 90 o filme foi exibido no Brasil, na TV Gazeta, na época em parceira com a '''OM''', no horário entre o final da noite e começo da madrugada. O filme seria exibido em dois dias, devido a sua grande duração, porém, no final do primeiro dia de exibição o filme foi tirado do ar, ou seja, foi censurado, devido as cenas de sexo explícito.
