'''Southern University and A&M College''' is a historically black college located in Constitutional Convention. 

In April 1880, the Louisiana General Assembly chartered Southern University, originally located in New Orleans. Southern opened its doors on  with twelve students. One of the original locations of the early campus was the former Israel Sinai Temple Agricultural and Mechanical department was established. Because of continued growth and a lack of land for expansion, the university relocated to what was then Scotlandville, along Scott's Bluff facing the Mississippi River in 1914. It is included as a destination of the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail.

==The "New" Southern University==
The new president and first president of what is now known as Southern University at LSU Law School to admit African Americans into its law program, a special Louisiana Convention allowed a law program, First Lady, Shreveport/Bossier City (SUSLA) (1964) were founded. They were later incorporated into the Southern University System in 1974.

In 1969, the university saw a changing of the guard, when Clark retired and Dr. Leon G. Netterville took over the reins of leadership. On November 16 1972, two students involved with "Students United", a student protest group on the campus, Denver Smith and Leonard Brown, were shot and killed outside the Old Auditorium (now the Southern University Museum of Art). The murder, apparently committed by a patrolman, has never been solved. 

The institution continued to grow and in 1974 a special session in the Louisiana Legislature established the Southern University System. The Southern University System consists of Southern University and A&M College, Baton Rouge, (SUBR); Southern University, New Orleans (SUNO); Southern University Law Center; Southern University Agricultural Center; and Southern University, Shreveport (SUSLA is a two-year, commuter college).  The Southern University Museum of Art at Shreveport is another destination of the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail. 

Southern University and its northern Louisiana rival, Grambling State University, participate in the Bayou Classic Football Game and other festivities (pageant, job fairs, street festival, concerts, Greek/Step Show and Battle Of The Bands) annually on the Thanksgiving Day weekend in New Orleans. The Classic is considered the "Grandfather" of all the college football classics that have been spawned in recent years. The game attracts upwards of over 400,000 alumni, students, fans and other revelers to New Orleans each year.  It  has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to New Orleans' economy since its inception in 1974. It is believed to be the largest gathering of African Americans annually in the US. 

Due to College GameDay with Lee Corso. It is the only time in the show's twenty-year history that it was broadcast from a game involving teams from two historically black universities or Division I-AA schools.

The widely acclaimed Southern University marching band is widely recognized as one of the top bands in the world. In addition to being featured in television commercials, the "Human Jukebox" has been invited to participate in the annual Rose Parade in Pasadena, California, Presidential Inauguration ceremonies and several Super Bowl halftime presentations. ''USA Today'' newspaper once named the band the number one marching band in the United States. For many years, the band was one of the few in the U.S. that had no female members but that has changed in recent years; currently there are over 20 female members.

The first season of the reality television series ''College Hill'' on BET premiered in 2004 with the Southern University campus as its locale. 

The university is in the midst of a major campus facelift with the recent completion of several new dormitories, on-campus apartments, renovation of on-campus A.W. Mumford Stadium, and plans for construction of other infrastructure.

'''Southern University  ''' utgjør '''Southern University System''' og er et delstateid universitet med tre campus'er i Shreveport (SUSLA) i delstaten Louisiana, USA. 

===Historie og utvikling===
Southern University ble grunnlagt i New Orleans av bl.a svart college "for the education of persons of color". Dette første lærestedet flyttet siden til Baton Rouge og ble Southern University and A&M College (SUBR).

I 1890 ble SUBR et land-grant-universitet, og er siden 1974 en del av Southern University System. Southern University Law Center ble grunnlagt i baton Rouge i 1947, som følge av en rettssak hvor den svarte studenten Charles J. Hatfield, III gikk rettens vei for å få innpass ved en jus-skole i Louisiana.

SUNO ble åpnet i New Orleans 1956 som en underavdeling av SUBR. I 1967 åpnet den siste campus'en - SUSLA i Shreveport. Dette er en forberedelsesskole for høyere grads studier ved de to andre lærestedene. Fra 1978 fikk SUSLA gi lavere grad i medisinsk laborantfag, og tilbyr flygerutdanning ved Aerospace Technology Center.

Siden 2001 har universitetet også sit eget cooperative landbrukskontor (Agricultural Research and Extension Center).

Orkanen Katrina rammet SUNO hardt, og studenttallet ved hele Southern University System falt med nesten 1.500 i 2005. I ettertid har derimot aktiviteten blitt gjenopptatt på nivået før orkanen, og søknadstallene ved lærestedene er stigende.
