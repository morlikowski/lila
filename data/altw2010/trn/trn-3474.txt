The '''3-inch Gun Motor Carriage (GMC) M10''', was a United States tank destroyer of World War II. US troops also called them "TDs" (a nickname for any tank destroyer), and '''"Wolverine"''',<ref>http://www.audiemurphy.com/m10.htm</ref><ref>http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-9105583/tank-destroyer</ref> a name adapted from the official designation given by the British to their Lend-Lease 3-inch GMC M10s.

==Development==

During World War I and through the end of World War II, armored warfare doctrine held that armored vehicles should be designed to fulfill one of two roles: infantry support and antitank warfare. Because the roles were seen as mutually exclusive, separate vehicles were designed for each role. In some nations such as Britain, these were termed infantry tanks and cruiser tanks. Germany fulfilled the roles initially through the development of the Panzer III for antitank warfare, and the Panzer IV for direct fire support, and later by developing specialized turretless assault guns and tank destroyers. In the United States Army, tanks were seen as infantry support just as they had been in World War I, while antitank warfare was to be performed by tank destroyers. Though equipped with turrets (unlike most tank destroyers of the day), the typical American design was more heavily gunned, but more lightly armored, and thus more maneuverable, than a true tank.  The idea was to use speed and agility as a defense, rather than thick armor, to bring a powerful self-propelled gun into action against enemy tanks.  

The '''3-inch Gun Motor Carriage T35''' was the prototype of the M10. It was equipped with a 3-inch (76.2 mm) gun in a new sloped, circular, open-topped turret, developed from the Heavy Tank T1/M6 turret, and mounted on an early-production Medium Tank M4A1 hull. 

This prototype was further developed by sloping the hull, using an M4A2 chassis, and replacing the circular turret with a pentagonal version; this model was designated '''3-inch Gun Motor Carriage T35E1'''. In June 1942 the T35E1 was finalized as the '''3-inch Gun Motor Carriage M10''' and ordered into full production.

A British variant, designated "Achilles", was developed to mount the successful 17-pounder anti-tank gun in a modified turret. It was used by the British, Canadian and Polish armies in Italy and North-West Europe.<ref>[http://www.armyvehicles.dk/m10achilles.htm M10 Achilles IIC]</ref>

==Armament==

The M10 used an Medium Tank M4A2 chassis (M10A1s used M4A3 chassis) with an open-topped turret mounting a 3" (76.2 mm) Gun M7. This gun fired the AP (Armor Piercing) M79 Shot that could penetrate 3 inches of armor at 1,000 yards at 30 degrees from vertical. Other ammunition carried throughout its service life included the APCBC (Armor Piercing Capped Ballistic Cap) M62 Projectile, HVAP (High Velocity Armor Piercing) M93 Shot, and APHE (Armor Piercing High Explosive); 54 rounds of 3-inch ammunition were carried. The rear of the turret carried a large counterweight which gave it a distinctive shape.

A .50 cal Browning M2HB machine gun could be mounted on the top rear of the turret for use against enemy infantry and for antiaircraft use, along with 1000 rounds. The crew were also equipped with their personal weapons for self-protection.

The M10 was numerically the most important U.S. tank destroyer of World War II. In its combat debut in the North African campaign, the M10 was successful as its M7 3-inch gun could destroy most German tanks then in service. The M10's heavy chassis did not conform to the tank destroyer doctrine of employing very light high-speed vehicles, and it began to be supplemented by the 76 mm Gun Motor Carriage M18 starting in mid-1944.  Later in the Tiger and 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage M36 was beginning to replace it, though it remained in service until the end of the war.  In the Pacific, US Army M10s were used for infantry support but were unpopular due to their open-topped turrets, which made them more vulnerable than a fully-enclosed tank to Japanese close-in infantry attacks.

'''狼獾式-{zh-hans:坦克歼击车; zh-hant:驅逐戰車;}-'''（''''''）為美軍在第二次世界大戰期間所使用的一款-{zh-hans:坦克歼击车; zh-hant:驅逐戰車;}-。當時的美軍部隊一般都稱它作「」（美軍當時以一詞來稱呼所有-{zh-hans:坦克歼击车; zh-hant:驅逐戰車;}-）或「狼獾式」（），而英國人則給它命名為「''''''」，亦是它的官方名稱。

==概要==
二戰初期，美軍為了彌補在步兵支援，以及突破敵陣兩方面上的不足，於是整編了一支專門對付敵軍坦克的-{zh-hans:坦克歼击车; zh-hant:驅逐戰車;}-部隊。可是，最早期被編入這支部隊的，只是一些裝配了37毫米反坦克炮的卡車，或是一些使用75毫米野戰炮的M3半履帶車。而這支部隊後來投入北非作戰，以汲取實戰經驗。然而，在北非的實戰中，這支部隊的問題開始浮現——機動性及防禦力十分不足。為此，美軍開始研發新的武器以取代這支部隊。

==發展==
美軍早期研發的'''-{zh-hans:坦克歼击车; zh-hant:驅逐戰車;}-'''（''''''）就是的試作型。這款試作型使用了M6重型坦克那款圓形的開放式炮塔，並裝配一支3英吋口徑的火炮。此外，車身更以M4中戰車的外型作為藍本設計。同一時間，蘇軍新研發的T-34坦克在東線戰場取得極大成功，為-{zh-hans:坦克歼击车; zh-hant:驅逐戰車;}-的研發提供了靈感，所以型-{zh-hans:坦克歼击车; zh-hant:驅逐戰車;}-的裝甲厚度及主炮也和坦克十分相似。

後來，美國當局為它改進一部分的外觀及性能：車身的外殼加上了斜甲，而本來的圓形炮塔也被替換成五角形炮塔。這款經過改進的版本定名為-{zh-hans:坦克歼击车; zh-hant:驅逐戰車;}-。1942年6月，這款-{zh-hans:坦克歼击车; zh-hant:驅逐戰車;}-最終被更名為，並開始投入生產。

==構造及武裝==
美國當局打算以這款驅逐戰車打擊敵軍坦克，以掩護步兵進攻。為此，它特別使用了中戰車的底盤，再配上開放式炮塔及一支白朗寧M2機槍，以加強支援步兵攻擊的效果。

此外，-{zh-hans:坦克歼击车; zh-hant:驅逐戰車;}-的主炮也由本來的T12反坦克炮替換成3吋的M1918炮，比起同期中戰車的75毫米主炮更具打擊威力。後來，當局更為它配上火炮，威力更勝德國四號坦克，亦發揮了如德國88毫米防空炮一樣的貫穿力。可是，由於它所使用的炮彈過重，導致車身前後出現不平衡的情況。因此，研發當局為其車身後部添加負重，以平衡車身。

不僅車身重量分佈出現問題，它的炮塔部份也出現一些問題。由於它的炮塔和中戰車並不配合，造成需要手動迴轉炮塔的不便。針對這一點，有關當局曾經引入油壓動力迴轉裝置至車身內。但自M36積遜-{zh-hans:坦克歼击车; zh-hant:驅逐戰車;}-登場後，所有驅逐戰車都停止採用這個裝置。
