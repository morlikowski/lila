'''Mizoram'''  is one of the Seven Sister States in North Eastern India. It shares land borders with the states of Tripura, Assam and Manipur and the Chin state of Myanmar. Mizoram became the 23<sup>rd</sup> state of India on 20th February, 1987. Its population at the 2001 census stood at 888,573. Mizoram ranks first in India with a literacy rate of 91.1%.<ref>[http://www.nfhsindia.org/pdf/MZ.pdf Mizoram the most literate state in India]</ref>

Mizoram has the most variegated hilly terrain in the eastern part of India. The hills are steep (avg. height 1000 metres) and separated by rivers which flow either to the north or south creating deep gorges between the hill ranges. The highest peak in Mizoram is the Blue Mountain with a height of 2210 metres. Its tropical location combined with the high altitude give it a mild climate all year round. Mizoram is rich in flora and fauna and many kinds of tropical trees and plants thrive in the area. Mizoram literally mean's land of the highlanders.

Mizoram has a mild climate, not very  warm in summer and not very cold in winter. During winter, the temperature varies from 11°C to 21°C and in summer it varies between 20°C to 29°C. The entire area is under the regular influence of monsoons. It rains heavily from May to September and the average rainfall is 254 cm, per annum. The average annual rainfall in Aizawl and Lunglei are 208 centimetres and 350 centimetres, respectively. Winter in Mizoram is normally rain-free. 

==History==

===Origin===
The origin of the Mizos, like those of many other tribes in the northeastern India is shrouded in mystery. The generally accepted view is that they were part of a great wave of migration from China and later moved out to India to their present habitat. It is possible that the Mizos came from Sinlung or Chhinlungsan located on the banks of the Yalung River in China. They first settled in the Shan State and moved on to Kabaw Valley to.It is believed that Mizos are originated from Mongolia.However there is no such written prove.

=== Khampat ===
The earliest Mizos who migrated to India were known as Kukis, the second batch of immigrants were called New Kukis. The Lushais were the last of the Mizo tribes to migrate to India. The Mizo history in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century is marked by many instances of tribal raids and retaliatory amount of autonomy was accepted by the government and enshrined in the Six Schedule of the Indian Constitution. The Lushai Hills Autonomous District Council came into being in 1952 followed by the formation of these bodies led to the abolition of chieftainship in the Mizo society. The autonomy however met the aspirations of the Mizos only partially. Representatives of the District Council and the Mizo Union pleaded with the States Reorganization Commission (SRC) in 1954 for integrated the Mizo-dominated areas of Tripura and Manipur with their District Council in Assam. The tribal leaders in the northeast were laboriously unhappy with the SRC recommendations. They met in Aizawl in 1955 and formed a new political party, Eastern India Union (EITU) and raised their demand for a separate state comprising of all the hill districts of Assam. The Mizo Union split and the breakaway faction joined the EITU. By this time, the UMFO also joined the EITU and then understanding of the Hill problems by the Chuliha Ministry, the demand for a separate Hill state by EITU was kept in abeyance.

===Mautam famine===
In 1959, the Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam Famine'. The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which resulted in a boom of the rat population. After eating bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plague to the villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles.  Still others moved to far away places, and a considerable number died of starvation. In this hour of darkness, many welfare organizations tried their best to help starving villagers. Earlier in 1955, the Mizo Cultural Society was formed with Pu Laldenga as its secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam Front'. During the famine of 1959–1960, this society took the lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name of Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages.

===Insurgency===
The Mizo National Famine Front dropped the word 'famine' and a new political organization, the Parliament, one each in the Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha

===Birth of Mizoram state===
Rajiv Gandhi's election to power following his mother's death signaled the beginning of a new era in Indian politics. Laldenga met the prime minister on 15 February 1985. Some contentious issues which could not be resolved during previous talks were referred to him for his advice. With Pakistan having lost control of Bangladesh and no support from Pakistan, the Mizo National Front used the opportunity that had now presented itself. New Delhi felt that the Mizo problem had been dragging on for a long time, while the Mizo National Front was convinced that disarming, to live as respectable Indian citizens, was the only way of achieving peace and development. Statehood was a prerequisite to the implementation of the accord signed between the Mizo National Front and the Union Government on 30 June 1986. The document was signed by Pu Laldenga on behalf of the Mizo National Front, and the Union Home Secretary R.D. Pradhan on behalf of the government. Lalkhama, Chief Secretary of Mizoram, also signed the agreement. The formalization of the state of Mizoram took place on 20 February 1987. Chief Secretary Lalkhama read out the proclamation of statehood at a public meeting organized at Aizawl's parade ground. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi flew in to Aizawl to inaugurate the new state. Hiteshwar Saikia was appointed as Governor of Mizoram.

==Geography==
===Hills===
Mizoram is a land of rolling hills, rivers and lakes. As many as 21 major hills ranges or peaks of different heights run through the length and breadth of the state, with plains scattered here and there. The average height of the hills to the west of the state are about 1,000 metres. These gradually rise up to 1,300 metres to the east. Some areas, however, have higher ranges which go up to a height of over 2,000 metres. The Phwangpui, situated in the southeastern part of the state, is the highest peak in Mizoram.

===Rivers===
The biggest river in Mizoram is the River Kaladan also known as Chhimtuipui Lui in local Mizo language. It originates from Chin State in Myanmar and passes through Saiha and Lawngtlai districts in Southern tip of Mizoram and goes back to Myanmar Rakhine state, finally it enters Bay of Bengal at [Akyab], a very popular port in [Sittwe], [Myanmar]. Indian government has invested millions of rupees to set up inland water ways along this river to trade with Myanmar. The project name is known as Kaladan Multipurpose project[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizoram#Water_ways].

Although many more rivers and streams drain the hill ranges, the most important and useful rivers are the Tlawng (also known as Dhaleswari or Katakhal), Tut (Gutur), Tuirial (Sonai) and Tuivawl which flow through the northern territory and eventually join the Koldoyne (Chhimtuipui) which originates in Myanmar, is an important river in the south of Mizoram. It has four tributaries and the river is in patches. The western part is drained by Karnaphuli (Khawthlang tuipui) and its tributaries. A number of important towns, including Chittagong in Bangladesh, are situated at the mouth of the river. Before Independence, access to other parts of the country was only possible through the river routes via Cachar in the north, and via Chittagong in the south. Entry through the latter was cut off when the subcontinent was partitioned and ceded to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1947.

===Lakes (Dil)===
Lakes are scattered all over the state, but the most important among these are Palak dil (Pala Tipo), Tamdil, Rungdil, and Rengdil. The Palak lake, the biggest lake in Mizoram is situated in Mara Autonomous District Council (MADC) within Saiha District which is part of southern Mizoram and covers an area of 30 hectares. It is believed that the lake was created as a result of an earthquake or a flood. The local people believe that a village which was submerged still remains intact deep under the waters. The Tamdil lake is a natural lake situated 110/85 km from Aizawl. Legend has it that a huge mustard plant once stood in this place. When the plant was cut down, jets of water sprayed from the plant and created a pool of water, thus the lake was named '''Tamdil'' which means of 'Lake of Mustard Plant'. Today the lake is an important tourist attraction and a holiday resort.

However, the most significant lake in Mizo history Rih Dil is ironically located in Myanmar, a few kilometres from the India-Myanmar border. It was believed that the departed souls pass through this lake before making their way to "Pialral" or heaven.

==Demographics==
===People===
The great majority of Mizoram's population is comprised of several ethnic tribes who are either culturally or linguistically linked. These myriad ethnic groups are collectively known as the Lushais/Lusais (People who play with heads) /Luseis (Long-Headed people) or otherwise called Mizos (Mi= People, Zo= Hill) both of which are umbrella terms. These days, there is an increasing of the importance of unity among all the Mizo tribes living in different parts of the northeastern states of India, Myanmar and Bangladesh. The Mizos are divided into numerous tribes, the largest of which is possibly the Lushais, which comprises almost two-thirds of the state's population. Other Mizo tribes include Hmar, Mara, Paite, Lai, Ralte. The Riang, a subtribe of Tripuri and the Chakma of Arakanese origin, are a non-Mizo tribe living in Mizoram.

===Religion===
Some 87% of the population (including all ethnic Mizos) is Theravada Buddhism mixed with elements of Hinduism and Animism.

In recent decades, a number of Chin, Kuki, and Mizo. Several hundred have formally converted to Orthodox Judaism, many openly practise an Orthodox type of Judaism. The Bnei Menashe do not see themselves as converts, but believe themselves to be ethnically Jewish, descendants of one of the Lost Tribes of Israel (''see Bnei Menashe''). The Jewish population of the Bnei Menashe currently is estimated at 9,000 people.

Other faiths include Hindus who form a small minority in the state, at 3.6% of the population following the religion.<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Social_and_cultural/Religion.aspx Census of India - Login<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Muslims also form a small minority with 1.1% of the population following the faith. People who believe in this faith are from other state but living in Mizoram<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Social_and_cultural/Religion.aspx Census of India - Login<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Politics==
As in other Indian states, the head of the state government is a governor appointed by the Union Government. His/her appointment is largely ceremonial, and his/her main role is to oversee the swearing in of the Chief Minister. The Chief Minister, who holds the real executive powers, is the head of the party or coalition garnering the largest majority in the state elections. The governor also appoints the cabinet ministers on the advice of the Chief Minister. Mizoram has a unicameral legislature like most other Indian states. Mizoram has one seat in the Lok Sabha and one in the Rajya Sabha. (There are a total of 40 State Assembly seats.) The Lais, Maras and Chakmas have separate autonomous District Councils. The present Chief Minister of Mizoram is Pu Zoramthanga.

==Administration==
After the 1986 signing of the Historic Memorandum of Settlement between the Government of India and the Mizo National Front, Mizoram was granted Statehood on February 20, 1987 (as per the Statehood Act of 1986). Mizoram became the 23<sup>rd</sup> State of the Indian Union.

The capital of Mizoram is Aizawl. The Mizoram State Legislative Assembly has 40 seats. Mizoram is now represented at the Parliament by two MPs, one in the Lok Sabha and the other in the Rajya Sabha.

Mizoram has witnessed vast constitutional, political and administrative changes in recent years. The traditional chieftainship was abolished and the District and Regional Councils (created under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India) gave a substantial measure of local control. Today the Lais, Maras, and the Chakmas have separate Autonomous District Councils. The Village Councils are the grassroots of democracy in Mizoram.

Mizoram is divided into 8 districts:
*Aizawl
*Lunglei
*Kolasib
*Mamit
*Serchhip
*Saiha
*Champhai
*Lawngtlai

There are three Autonomous District Councils (ADC) for ethnic tribes in Mizoram, namely Chakma Autonomous District Council (CADC) for ethnic Chakmas in South-western Mizoram bordering Bangladesh, Mara Autonomous District Council (MADC) for Mara people in the Southern-most corner and Lai Autonomous District Council (LADC) for Lai people in South-eastern part of the state.

==Education==
The College of Veterinary Sciences & Animal Husbandry, Selesih, Aizawl, Mizoram[http://www.vetcolcau.org] is the premier institute of Veterinary Medicine catering the needs of north-eastern states of India.

Under Mizoram University, there are 29 undergraduate colleges including 2 professional institutions affiliated with the university. The total enrollment in these institutions is approximately 5200 students.

==Economy==
In terms of economic development, Mizoram lags behind in comparison to the rest of the country. 9th Five Year Plan (1997–2002) gives much priority to the "agro-based industry" as nearly 70% of the population is engaged in agriculture.

Mizoram's gross domestic state product for 2004 is estimated at $685 million in current prices.

===Bamboo===
30% of Mizoram is covered with wild bamboo forests, many of which are largely unexploited. Mizoram harvests 40% of India's 80 million-ton annual bamboo crop. The current state administration wishes to increase revenue streams from bamboo and aside from uses as a substitute for timber, there is research underway to utilize bamboo more widely such as using bamboo chippings for paper mills, bamboo charcoal for fuel, and a type of  "bamboo vinegar" which was introduced by Japanese Scientist Mr. Hitoshi Yokota, and used as a fertilizer.

====Bamboo harvests, rats and famine====
Many of the plans that the administration had were disrupted with the advent of the flowering season for bamboo in May 2006, an event which takes place once every 48 years. 

"After the bamboo flowers, it dies and is finished," current Chief Minister Pu Zoramthanga said in an interview to Reuters in May 2006. "Unless we harvest it, we are going to waste billions and billions of rupees. We have to make roads into the jungle and harvest it as soon as possible." He admitted it will only be possible to harvest five percent of the bamboo before it flowers.

The flowering of the bamboo leads to a dramatic increase in the local rat population; some experts believe that the flower has an effect on rat fertility. In a process locally known as ''paddy fields.

Records from the British Raj indicate that Mizoram suffered famine in 1862 and again in 1911 after the region witnessed similar bamboo flowering .It was found that bamboo flowers increased rat hormones and caused them to reproduce at a massive rate the rats ate the flowers and then ate food in the sorounding areas before dieing of starvation. The last ''Mautam'', in 1958-59, resulted in the recorded deaths of at least a hundred people, besides heavy loss to human property and crops. It led to the foundation of the Mizo National Famine Front, set up to provide relief to far-flung areas; the front later became the Mizo National Front, which, under former Chief Minister Laldenga and current CM Zoramthanga, fought a bitter separatist struggle for twenty years against the Indian Army.

The 2006 ''Mautam'' has led to an explosion in the rat population and the army has been called to assist embattled civil authorities and, apart from killing rats, help educate people on pest control and means of deterrents such as growing turmeric and spices which repel rats [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5044436.stm].
