The Rift Valley cuts through the middle of the region north-to-south. Oldonyo Lengai (Mountain of God in Maasai language) is an active volcano to the north of Ngorongoro. Altitudes throughout the region vary widely, but much of it ranges from 900 to 1600 metres (3,000 to 5,500 feet in elevation. Mt. Meru, the second highest mountain in Tanzania after Kilimanjaro, peaks at 4,655 metres (14,980 feet).

The city of Arusha is at the southern foot of Mt. Meru. Areas to the south and southeast of the mountain tend to be sufficiently watered and are the most densely populated areas of the region.
