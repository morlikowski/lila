'''Pope Martin IV''' (between 1210 and 1220 &ndash; March 28, 1285), born '''Simon  de Brion''', held the papacy from February 21, 1281 until his death. 

Simon de Brion, son of Jean, sieur de Brion,  was born at the château of Meinpicien<ref>Nikolaus Backes, ''Kardinal Simon de Brion'' (Breslau) 1910, used by H.K. Mann and J. Hollnsteiner, ''The Lives of the Popes in the Middle Ages'' XVI (London) 1932: 171-205., both quoted by Richard Kay, "Martin IV and the Fugitive Bishop of Bayeux" ''Speculum'' '''40'''.3 (July 1965, pp. 460-483) p 461f.</ref> in the province of canon of the cathedral chapter in Louis IX, an office he held until he was elected pope in 1281. In 1259, just as he disappears from the documents at Rouen, he was appointed to the council of the king, who made him keeper of the great seal, chancellor of France, one of the great officers in the household of the king.

In  December 1261,<ref>Date as given by Mann and Hollnsteiner 1932.</ref> the new French pope Urban IV made him cardinal-priest, with the ''titulus'' of the church of St. Cecilia. This entailed Simon de Brion's residence in Rome.

He returned to France as a legate for Urban IV and also for his successor Pope Clement IV, in 1264-1269 and again in 1274-1279, under Pope Gregory X. In the negotiations for papal support for the assumption of the crown of Sicily by Charles of Anjou, he became deeply politically entwined.  As legate he presided over several synods on reform, the most important of which was held at Bourges in September, 1276.

Six months after the death of Pope Nicholas III in 1280, Charles of Anjou intervened in the papal conclave at Viterbo by imprisoning two influential Italian cardinals, on the grounds that they were interfering with the election.  Without their opposition, Simon de Brie was unanimously elected to the papacy, taking the name Martin IV, on February 22, 1281.   

Viterbo was placed under interdict for the imprisonment of the cardinals, and Rome was not at all inclined to accept a hated Frenchman as Pope, so Martin IV was crowned instead at Orvieto, on March 23, 1281. Though he was only the second Pope to choose the name Martin, in the 13th century the papal chancery misread the names of the two popes Marinus as Martin (''EB'', "Brie") so he is now known as Martin IV, the Popes Marinus I (882-884) and Marinus II (942-946) being listed as Martins.

Dependent on Charles of Anjou in nearly everything, the new Pope quickly appointed him to the position of excommunicated the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus (1261-1282), who stood in the way of Charles' plans to restore the Latin Empire of the East that had been established in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade. He thus broke the tenuous union which had been reached between the Greek and the Latin Churches at the Second Council of Lyons in 1274, and further compromise was rendered impossible. 

In 1282, Charles was overthrown in the violent massacre known as the a crusade against him, but it was all in vain.
