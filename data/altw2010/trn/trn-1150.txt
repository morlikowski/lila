'''玛琳·乔伊斯·奥蒂'''（Merlene Joyce Ottey，），牙买加裔斯洛文尼亚女子田径运动员。2002年前，奥蒂代表牙买加一共夺得过14枚世界田径锦标赛短跑奖牌和8枚奥运会奖牌，是世界上夺得奥运会和世锦赛田径奖牌最多的女运动员，但是未能夺得奥运会金牌是其终生遗憾。

奥蒂于莫斯科奥运会上夺得了女子200米铜牌，成为首位夺得奥运奖牌的加勒比海英语国家女运动员。在接下来的二十年中，她在各种比赛中屡创佳绩，先后15次成为牙买加最佳女运动员。但是在亚特兰大奥运会上，她以千分之一秒的差距败给盖尔·德弗斯，宣告其冲击奥运金牌的梦想从此破灭。

1999年，奥蒂在瑞士洛桑参加一次比赛后未能通过兴奋剂检测，被禁赛两年。奥蒂声称检测结果是错误的，并不断上诉。2000年，国际田径联合会宣布奥蒂无罪，引发了广泛争议。虽然及时得到解禁，但是奥蒂在当年牙买加奥运选拔赛上仅取得女子100米第四名，只有资格参加4*100米接力比赛。奥蒂希望牙买加奥委会能够让她取得一个参赛名额，但是遭到了许多牙买加运动员的反对，他们甚至在奥运村内组织了一场反对奥蒂的游行。

'''Merlene Joyce Ottey''' (born track athlete. Ottey began her career representing Jamaica, but since 100 meters and third on the 200 meters list. 

Ottey holds the record for being the oldest track medalist ever, for running the fastest Women's Indoor World Championships medals (fourteen) [http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/gwr5/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=45730]. Her career achievements and longevity have led to her being called the "Queen of the Track". 

==Life and sprinting career==
'''Ottey''' was born the fourth of seven children to Hubert and Joan Ottey in Cold Spring, Hanover. She was introduced to the sport by her mother, who bought her a manual on track and field. In her early school years in the 1970s, Ottey attended Gurneys Mount and Pondside Schools before graduating from Ruseas and Vere Technical high schools. There she frequently competed barefooted in local races. 

Ottey's inspiration came from listening to the track and field broadcast from the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, where Donald Quarrie ran in the sprint finals. Her athletics career took off when she emigrated to the U.S., and attended the University of Nebraska in 1979, where she joined the track team. She represented Jamaica in the 1979 Pan American Games, winning a bronze medal in the 200 m. She graduated from university with a Bachelor of Arts Degree, and married fellow athlete Nathaniel Page in 1984. The couple later divorced.

In the 1980 Moscow games, Merlene Ottey became the first female English speaking Olympic medal. Back in Jamaica, she was awarded an Officer of the Order of Nation, and the Order of Distinction for ‘services in the field of sport’. 

In the 1982 Commonwealth Games, Ottey won a gold medal in the 200m, and silver medal in the 100m. Nearly a decade later, in the 1990 Commonwealth Games, she won gold in both events. Ottey was named Ambassador of Jamaica after her gold medal win in the 1993 world championships. She has also been named Jamaican Sportswoman of the year 15 times between 1979 and 1997.

Throughout her career, she has won eight Olympic medals, the most by any woman in track and field history [http://www.olympic.org.nz/Article.aspx?ID=685]. These include three silver and five bronze medals. She has never won an olympic gold medal, but lost by as little as a thousandth of a second to Gail Devers in the 100 m in 1996 and by a hundredth of a second on numerous occasions to different athletes. 

She won 14 World Championship medals between 1983 to 1997 &mdash;more than any other athlete, male or female &mdash; however, her failure to win many golds in major international competitions earned her the nickname "the Bronze Queen" in racing circles. She has won a total of three gold, three silver and eight bronze medals in the 4 x 100 m relay, the 100-m, and 200-m races. Ottey was appointed an Ambassador at Large by the Jamaican government in 1993.

==Controversy==
In 1999, during a meet in Lucerne, Switzerland, a urine sample submitted had returned positive for the banned anabolic steroid nandrolone. Her 'B' sample also contained higher than normal levels of the substance. Ottey was subsequently banned by the IAAF from competing in the upcoming twenty-seventh Olympiad in Sydney, Australia in 2000.  She also pulled out of World Championships in Seville, Spain.

Ottey, however, fought to clear her name, asserting that, that  charge was a "terrible mistake", and that she was totally innocent of knowingly taking steroids. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/519559.stm]. In the summer of 2000, Ottey was cleared of all charges by the IAAF and Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association, and the laboratory who had tested her sample came under severe criticism.

In Jamaica, at the National Senior Trials prior to selection for the Olympics, Ottey placed a disappointing fourth. According to the rules of the Jamaica Amateur Athletics Association (JAAA), only athletes who had finished in the top three at the trials were eligible to run at the Olympics; she was only qualified to run on the Olympian and championship medallist Gregory Haughton lead the notorious "Games Village" protests to oust Ottey, which made international headlines. The protest ended when The International Olympic Committee (IOC) threatened to throw the Jamaicans out of the Games if the team managers were not able to control their charges. [http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/magazines/AllWoman/html/20040822T220000-0500_64978_OBS_MERLENE_OTTEY___NO_LONGER_GOING_FOR_GOLD__.asp]. 

At the 2000 Olympics, Ottey finished fourth in the 100 m she had fought to partake in, beaten from a medal by fellow Jamaican sprinter Tayna Lawrence. The race was won by Marion Jones who registered 10.75 seconds, who was followed by Ekaterini Thanou of Greece in 11.12 seconds. Lawrence posted 11.18 seconds to Ottey 11.19 seconds. In the 4×100 relay, the Jamaican team — bronze medallist Lawrence, teenager and newcomer Veronica Campbell, and Beverly MacDonald — was anchored by Ottey to a silver medal. This medal gave Ottey her eighth medal, the most ever for a female athlete. However, In 2007 when American athlete Marion Jones admitted to steroid use during and after the Sydney Olympics, she was stripped of her medals, and so Ottey may be awarded the bronze medal, which would take her Olympic medal total to nine.

Due to the controversy, Ottey decided that "after Sydney I said I wasn't going to run another race for Jamaica ... because I felt like the Jamaicans were trying to push me out of the sport and I really needed to prove my point, that I might be 40 but I can still run."
