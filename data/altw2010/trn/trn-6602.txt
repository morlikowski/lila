'''Hanss Holbeins Jaunākais''' (* apm. 1497.g. Augsburgā, † 1543.g. Londonā) bija nozīmīgs vācu renesanses gleznotājs, viens no nozīmīgākajiem sava laika portretistiem. Starp Holbeina ievērojamākajiem darbiem jāmin "Sūtņi" (1533), "Henrija VIII portrets" (1540), "Tirgotāja Georga Gīzes portrets" (1532).

Holbeina agrīnajos darbos manāma spēcīga gotikas ietekme, taču tā izzūd pēc saskares ar itāliešu mākslu. Holbeina darbiem raksturīgas sīkas detaļas un liela precizitāte. 

==Biogrāfija==

Sākotnēji Holbeins mācījās pie sava tēva Hansa Holbeina Vecākā, taču pēc tam devās uz Bāzeli, kur 1519.g. tika uzņemts gleznotāju ģildē. Šajā laikā viņam pasūtīja altārgleznas, portretus, grāmatu ilustrācijas. Holbeins apceļoja arī Itāliju. Plašu atpazīstamību mākslinieks ieguva kā ilustrators (Holbeins ilustrējis, piemēram, Mārtiņa Lutera Bībeles tulkojumu vācu valodā, kā arī Roterdamas Erasma darbu "Muļķības slavinājums"). Holbeins personiski pazinis Erasmu un gleznojis vairākus viņa portretus.

Aptuveni 1527. gadā Holbeins pirmoreiz devās uz Londonu, kur apmetās 1532.g. Sākot ar 1536. gadu, Holbeins pievērsās tieši portretglezniecībai. Viņš gleznoja galminiekus un Henrija VIII galma gleznotāju (viņš modelēja arī karaļa tērpus).

Hanss Holbeins Jaunākais nomira Anglijā mēra epidēmijas laikā.

==Mākslinieciskā darbība==

Holbeins pamatā darbojies glezniecībā (īpaši – portretglezniecībā) un grafikā. Pirms portreta gleznošanas Holbeins ar zīmuli, tinti un krāsainu krītu izveidoja detalizētu modeļa zīmējumu, kura kontūras vēlāk pārnesa uz audekla, izmantojot nelielus caurumiņus, kurus noklāja ar ogles pulveri.

'''Hans Holbein the Younger''' (born c. 1497&ndash; died between German Dance of Death'', and is widely considered one of the finest portraitists of the Early Modern Period.
 
==Early life and career==
Holbein was born in Dutch humanist Erasmus.<ref>Wolf, 2004, p. 22</ref> Holbein was introduced to Erasmus, and later painted three portraits of him. 

In 1517 Holbein went to Martin Luther's translation of the Bible. Like his father, he designed stained glass windows and painted a small number of portraits. He married Elsbeth Binzenstock, the widow of a tanner, shortly before he was accepted into the local artists' guild.

==Holbein in England==
The Sir Thomas More. Holbein painted many portraits at the court of Henry VIII. While there he designed state robes for the king. He also designed many of the extravagant monuments and decorations for the coronation of Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn, in the summer of 1533. 

Several extant drawings said to be of Anne Boleyn are attributed to Holbein. One portrays a woman with rather plump features dressed in a plain nightgown and coif. Some have said that this shows the queen during pregnancy, sometime between 1533 and 1535, but recent research shows that the subject is most likely one of Anne's ladies-in-waiting, possibly Lady beheaded on May 19, 1536 on false charges of treason, adultery and incest. 

Holbein painted Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour. He also painted Jane's sister, Elizabeth Seymour, who married the son of Thomas Cromwell. This portrait was incorrectly identified as Henry's fifth wife, Queen Catherine Howard, when it was discovered in the Victorian era. After Seymour's death Holbein painted Christina of Denmark during negotiations for her prospective marriage to Henry VIII. The likeness met with Henry's approval, but Christina declined the offer of matrimony, citing a desire to retain her head.

Holbein also painted jewels is in fact Holbein's painting of Henry's fifth wife, Catherine Howard.

==Later years==
In his later years Holbein worked in both Basel and London. On one of his stays in London he painted German merchant Georg Giese, brother of Tiedemann Giese, at the Hanseatic League outpost in London, called the Steelyard (''Stalhof'').

While Holbein was working on another portrait of Henry, he died in London, apparently a victim of the plague.<ref>Wolf, 2004, p. 91</ref>  He made his will on October 7, 1543, and a document attached to it, dated November 29th, describes him as recently dead.<ref>Michael Levey, ''The German School; National Gallery Catalogues'', 1959, National Gallery, London</ref>

Holbein always made highly detailed scale as the original drawings. Although the drawings were made as studies for paintings, they stand on their own as independent, finely wrought works of art.

He painted a few, superb, portrait miniatures, having been taught the art by Lucas Horenbout, a Flemish illuminator who was also a court artist of Henry.<ref>According to Karel van Mander who refers to a "Lucas", assumed to be Horenbout.</ref> Horenbout painted Holbein in perhaps his best miniature, and the best portrait we have of Holbein, who never made a self-portrait (illustration).
