The '''''Iliad''''' is, together with the ''ancient Greek epic poems traditionally attributed to 9th or to the 8th century BC<ref>Pierre Vidal-Naquet, ''Le monde d'Homère'', Perrin 2000, p19</ref>, and many scholars believe it is the oldest extant work of literature in the ancient Greek language, making it the first work of European literature.  The existence of a single author for the poems is disputed as the poems themselves show evidence of a long oral tradition and hence, possible multiple authors. 

The poem concerns events during the tenth and final year in the siege of the city of ''Ilion'', or Greeks (See Latin, ''Ilium''), the city proper, as opposed to ''Troy'' (in Turkish "Truva", in Greek, Τροία, ''Troía''; in Latin, ''Troia, Troiae, f.''), the state centered around Ilium, over which the names ''Ilium'' and ''Troy'' are used interchangeably.

==Date==
For most of the twentieth century, scholars dated the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' to the late 9th or to the Martin West and 7th or even the 6th century BC.

==The story of the ''Iliad''==

thumb|right|220px|The first verses of the ''Iliad''

The ''Iliad'' begins with these lines:
<blockquote>
{{Polytonic|μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος<br>
οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκεν,}}<br>
Sing, goddess, the rage of Achilles the son of Peleus,<br>
the destructive rage that sent countless ills on the Achaeans...
</blockquote>

The first word of Homer's ''Iliad'' is the ancient Greek word  (''mēnis''), ''fury'', ''rage'', or ''wrath''. This word announces the major theme of the ''Iliad'': the wrath of Myrmidon warriors, the Greeks suffer defeat by the Trojans, almost to the point of losing their will to fight. Achilles re-enters the fighting when Patroclus is killed by the Trojan prince Hector. Achilles slaughters many Trojans and kills Hector. In his rage, he then refuses to return Hector's body and instead defiles it. Priam, the father of Hector, ransoms his son's body, and the ''Iliad'' ends with the funeral of Hector.

Homer devotes long passages to frank, blow-by-blow descriptions of combat. He gives the names of the fighters, recounts their taunts and battle-cries, and gruesomely details the ways in which they kill and wound one another. Often, the death of a hero only escalates the violence, as the two sides battle for his armor and corpse, or his close companions launch a punitive attack on his killer. The lucky ones are sometimes whisked away by friendly charioteers or the intervention of a god, but Homeric warfare is still some of the most bloody and brutal in literature.

The ''Iliad'' has a very strong religious and supernatural element. Both sides in the war are extremely pious, and both have heroes descended from divine beings. They sacrifice to the gods and consult priests and prophets to decide their actions. For their own part, the gods frequently join in battles, both by advising and protecting their favorites and even by participating in combat against humans and other gods. 

The ''Iliad's'' huge cast of characters connects the Trojan War to many ancient myths, such as Jason and the Argonauts, the Seven Against Thebes, and the Labors of Hercules. Many ancient Greek myths exist in multiple versions, so Homer had some freedom to choose among them to suit his story. See Greek mythology for more detail.

The action of the ''Iliad'' covers only a few weeks of the tenth and final year of the Paris' abduction of King Menelaus) nor its end (the death of Achilles and the fall of Troy). Other epic poems, collectively known as the Epic Cycle or cyclic epics, narrated many of these events; these poems only survive in fragments and later descriptions. See Trojan War for a summary of the events of the war.

===Synopsis===
As the poem begins, the Greeks have captured Chryséis, the daughter of Briséis, whom the Achaeans had given to Achilles as a spoil of war. This causes Achilles, widely seen as the best warrior of the war, to withdraw from the fighting.

In counterpoint to Achilles' pride stands the Trojan prince Hector, son of King Priam, a husband and father who fights to defend his city and his family. With Achilles on the sidelines, Hector leads successful counterattacks against the Greeks, who have built a fortified camp around their ships pulled up on the Trojan beach. The best remaining Greek fighters, including Odysseus and Diomedes, are wounded, and the gods favor the Trojans. When the Trojans finally threatened the Greek ships with fire, Achilles allows Patroclus, impersonating him by wearing his armor, to lead the Myrmidons back into battle. The death of Patroclus at the hands of Hector brings Achilles back to the war for revenge, and he slays Hector in single combat. Hector's body is abused for days until his father, King Priam, comes to Achilles alone (but aided by Hermes) to ransom his son's body, and Achilles is moved to pity. The funeral of Hector ends the poem.

===After the ''Iliad''===
Although the ''Iliad'' scatters foreshadowings of certain events subsequent to the funeral of Hector, and there is a general sense that the Trojans are doomed, Homer does not set out a detailed account of the fall of Troy. For the story as developed in later Greek and Roman poetry and drama, see Trojan War.  The other Homeric poem, the Odyssey, is the story of Odysseus' long journey home from Troy; the two poems between them incorporate many references forward and back and overlap very little, so that despite their narrow narrative focus they are a surprisingly complete exploration of the themes of the Troy story.

==Major characters==

:''See also: :Category:Deities in the Iliad''

The ''Iliad'' contains a large number of characters. The latter half of the second book (often called the Catalogue of Ships) is devoted entirely to listing the various commanders and their contingents. Many of the battle scenes in the ''Iliad'' feature minor characters who are quickly slain. See Trojan War for a detailed list of participating armies and warriors.
*The Achaeans () - the word ''Hellenes'', which would today be translated as ''Greeks'', is not used by Homer. Also called Danaans (Δαναοί) and Argives ('Aργεĩοι).
** Agamemnon, King of Mycenae, and leader of the Achaeans
** Achilles, King of the Myrmidions, foremost Achaean warror, he clashes with Agamemnon and sits out much of the combat. After the death of Patrolocus, he returns to battle and slays Hector.
** Odysseus, King of Ithaca, the most clever Achaean commander. The hero of the ''Odyssey''
** Ajax the Greater, a large warrior, second only in fighting prowess to Achilles
**Menelaus, King of Sparta and husband of Helen
**Diomedes, the youngest Achaean king; he is king of Argos.
**Ajax the Lesser, another Achaean leader, frequently partnered with Ajax the greater
*The Trojan men
**Hector, son of the Trojan king Priam and the foremost warrior of Troy, slain by Achilles
**Aeneas, son of Anchises and Aphrodite
**  Paris, son of King Priam, he is the lover who stole Helen and started the Trojan war
**Priam, the aged king of Troy
**Polydamas, a young Trojan commander who sometimes figures as a foil for Hector by proving cool-headed and prudent when Hector charges ahead. Polydamas gives the Trojans sound advice, but Hector seldom acts on it.
**Agenor, a Trojan warrior who attempts to fight Achilles in Book 21
**Dolon (), a Trojan who is sent to spy on the Achaean camp in Book 10.
**Antenor, a Trojan nobleman, advisor to King Priam, and father of many Trojan warriors. Antenor argues that Helen should be returned to Menelaus in order to end the war, but Paris refuses to give her up.
**Polydorus, a Trojan prince and son of Priam and Laothoe

*The Trojan women
**Paris, etc.
**Menelaus, now espoused to Paris
**Andromache (), Hector's wife and mother of their infant son, Astyanax ()
**Cassandra (), daughter of Priam, prophetess, first courted and then cursed by Apollo.  As her punishment for offending him, she accurately foresees the fate of Troy, including her own death and the deaths of her entire family, but does not have the power to do anything about it.

The Olympian deities, principally Eris, Thetis, and Proteus appear in the ''Iliad'' as advisers to and manipulators of the human characters. All except Zeus become personally involved in the fighting at one point or another (See Theomachy).

==Technical features==
The poem is written in dactylic hexameter. The ''Iliad'' comprises 15,693 lines of verse. Later ancient Greeks divided it into twenty-four books, or scrolls, and this convention has lasted to the present day with little change.

==Themes==
===Nostos===
Greek literature, especially in the fortunes of the Atreidae returning from the Agamemnon's will to win at any cost.

===Kleos===
Greek concept of Phoenix, and Ajax about the two fates (διχθαδίας κήρας 9.411) he must choose between.[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0009-837X%28200201%2997%3A1%3C61%3AKAR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-9].  The passage reads:
<blockquote>
{{Unicode|μήτηρ γάρ τέ μέ φησι θεὰ Θέτις ἀργυρόπεζα 	(410)<br>
διχθαδίας κῆρας φερέμεν θανάτοιο τέλος δέ.<br>
εἰ μέν κ’ αὖθι μένων Τρώων πόλιν ἀμφιμάχωμαι,<br> 
ὤλετο μέν μοι νόστος, ἀτὰρ κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται•<br>
εἰ δέ κεν οἴκαδ’ ἵκωμι φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν,<br>
ὤλετό μοι κλέος ἐσθλόν, ἐπὶ δηρὸν δέ μοι αἰὼν  	         (415)<br>
ἔσσεται, οὐδέ κέ μ’ ὦκα τέλος θανάτοιο κιχείη.}}<ref>''Iliad'' IX 410-416</ref><br>
</blockquote>
Richmond Lattimore translates the passage as follows:
<blockquote>
For my mother Thetis the goddess of silver feet tells me<br>
I carry two sorts of destiny toward the day of my death.  Either,<br>
if I stay here and fight beside the city of the Trojans,<br>
my return home is gone, but my glory shall be everlasting;<br>
but if I return home to the beloved land of my fathers,<br>
the excellence of my glory is gone, but there will be a long life<br>
left for me, and my end in death will not come to me quickly.<br><ref>Homer.''The Iliad''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951.</ref>
</blockquote>
Here Agamemnon's sceptre, the wheel of Hebe's chariot, the house of Zeus's throne, and the house of Lattimore translates the word to mean 'immortal forever' or 'imperishable forever.'  Achilles is the only mortal to ever be referred to in this way, which highlights the immense glory that awaits him if he stays and fights at Troy.

===Timê===
Related to kleos is the concept of timê (Greek: тιμή), usually translated as "respect" or "honor". One's timê is properly determined by one's station in life, or one's accomplishments (e.g., on the battlefield). The Greeks' troubles begin when Agamemnon dishonors (Book 1.11) the priest Chryses' attempt to ransom back his captive daughter; this insult prompts Chryses to call a plague down on the Achaeans. Later, Achilles' ruinous anger with Agamemnon stems from the disrespect (1.171) he feels the Argive king has shown him despite Achilles' obvious value to the Greek army.

===The Wrath of Achilles===
thumb|right|250px|''The Wrath of Achilles ''by Michel Drolling, 1819.

As mentioned above, the first word of the ''Iliad'' is the Greek μῆνιν (mēnin), meaning rage or wrath.  In this Achilles' rage and vanity, which sometimes seem almost childlike, drive the plot, from the Greeks' faltering in battle and the death of Patroclus to the slaying of Hector and the eventual fall of Troy, which is not explicitly depicted in the ''Iliad'' but is alluded to numerous times. The wrath of Achilles is first displayed in Book I in a meeting between the Greek kings and the seer Kalchas.  Agamemnon had dishonored Chryses, the Trojan priest of Apollo, by taking his daughter Chryseis and refusing to return her even when offered "gifts beyond count."<ref>Homer.The Iliad. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951. 1.13.</ref>  Chryses then prayed to Apollo for help, who rained arrows upon the Greeks for nine days.  At the meeting Achilles accuses Agamemnon of being "greediest for gain of all men."<ref>Homer.The Iliad. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951. 1.122.</ref>  At this Agamemnon replies:
<blockquote>
"But here is my threat to you.<br>
Even as Phoibos Apollo is taking away my Chryseis.<br>
I shall convey her back in my own ship, with my own<br>
followers; but I shall take the fair-cheeked Briseis,<br>
your prize, I myself going to your shelter, that you may learn well<br>
how much greater I am than you, and another man may shrink back<br>
from likening himself to me and contending against me."<ref>Homer.The Iliad. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951. 1.181-7.</ref><br>
</blockquote>
After this remark Achilles' anger can only be stayed by Achilles' rights.  This dooms the possibility of Greek victory in the near future, and the Trojans under Hector almost push the Greeks back into the sea in Book XII, causing Agamemnon to contemplate a defeated return to Greece.

"The Wrath of Achilles" turns the tide of the war again when his closest friend and possible lover Achilles' armor.  When Nestor informs him, Achilles mourns grievously, tearing out his hair and dirtying his face.  During his mourning, his mother Thetis again comes to comfort him.  Achilles tells her:
<blockquote>
So it was here that the lord of men Agamemnon angered me.<br>
Still, we will let all this be a thing of the past, and for all our<br>
sorrow beat down by force the anger deeply within us.<br>
Now I shall go, to overtake that killer of a dear life,<br>
Hektor; then I will accept my own death, at whatever<br>
time Zeus wishes to bring it about, and the other immortals.<ref>Homer.The Iliad. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951. 18.111-116.</ref><br>
</blockquote>
In his desire for vengeance Greek camp where he mourns for Patroclus.  Achilles later returns the body of Hector to the Trojan king Priam when he secretly infiltrates the Greek camp and begs Achilles for the body of his son.

===Fate===

Fate is shown to be a driving force behind many of the events of the ''Iliad''.  It is obeyed by both gods and men once it is set, and neither seems able (or willing) to change it.  The forming of Fate is unknown, but it is told by fate honorably and cowardly to attempt to avoid it.[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1375344]  However, fate does not predetermine all human action.  Instead, it primarily refers to the outcome or end, such as a man's life or a city such as Troy.[http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/homer.htm]  For instance, before killing him, Hector calls Patroclus a fool for trying to conquer him in battle.  Patroclus retorts:
<blockquote>
No, deadly destiny, with the son of Leto, has killed me,<br>
and of men it was Euphorbos; you are only my third slayer.<br>
And put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.<br>
You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already<br>
death and powerful destiny are standing beside you,<br>
to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus.<ref>Homer.The Iliad. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951. 16.849-54.</ref>
</blockquote>
Here fate as well as Hector's to die at the hands of Achilles.  Upon killing Hector, Achilles is fated to die at Troy as well.  All of these outcomes are predetermined, and although each character has free will in his actions he knows that eventually his end has already been set.

In some places it is ambiguous whether the gods, namely [Zeus], have the ability to alter fate.  This situation first appears in Book XVI when Zeus' mortal son, Sarpedon, is about to be slain in battle by Patroclus.  Zeus says:
<blockquote>
'Ah me, that it is destined that the dearest of men, Sarpedon,<br>
must go down under the hands of Menoitios' son Patroclus.<ref>Homer.The Iliad. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951. 16.433-4.</ref><br>
</blockquote>
When Zeus mentions his dilemma to Hera, she answers him:
<blockquote>
'Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?<br>
Do you wish to bring back a man who is mortal, one long since<br>
doomed by his destiny, from ill-sounding death and release him?<br>
Do it, then; but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you.<ref>Homer.The Iliad. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951. 16.440-3.</ref><br>
</blockquote>
When faced with having to decide between losing his beloved son and abiding by fate, even Zeus, the king of the gods, decides to let the matter pass as it has been already decided.  This same motif is used again when Zeus contemplates whether to spare Hector, whom he  loves and respects.  This time,  grey-eyed Athena answers him:   
<blockquote>
'Father of the shining bold, dark misted, what is this you said?<br>
Do you wish to bring back a man who is mortal, one long since<br>
doomed by his destiny, from ill-sounding death and release him?<br>
Do it, then; but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you.<ref>Homer.The Iliad. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951. 22.178-81.</ref><br>
</blockquote>
Again Zeus seems able to change fate but does not, choosing instead to abide by the outcomes decided long before that day's events.

Fate, working in the other direction, spares Aeneas from death at the hands of Achilles.  Apollo convinced Aeneas to confront Achilles during battle, although Achilles was too strong to be defeated.  Seeing Aeneas outmatched and in peril, Poseidon speaks out among the immortals:
<blockquote>
But come, let us ourselves get him away from death, for fear<br>
the son of Kronos may be angered if now Achilleus<br>
kills this man.  It is destined that he shall be the survivor,<br>
that the generation of Dardanos shall not die...<ref>Homer. ''The Iliad''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951. 20.300-4.</ref><br>
</blockquote>
Aeneas has been fated to survive the Trojan War and because of this is saved in battle from Achilles.  Although it is unclear whether the gods have the power to change fate, they repeatedly make a conscious effort to maintain fate even in opposition to their personal allegiances.  This shows that although its origins are mysterious, fate plays a huge role in the outcome of events in the ''Iliad''.  It is the one power that lies even above the gods and shapes the outcome of events more than any other force in the epic.

The question of fate also hints at the primeval division of the world by the three sons of Fates, deities of obscure and possibly far older origin than the Olympian gods, were often shown as having the only say as to the length of the lives of mortals, a matter over which the gods were unable to intervene.

In the Iliad:
* Greeks killed '''188''' people.
* Trojans killed '''53''' people.

==The ''Iliad'' as oral tradition==
The ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' were considered by Greeks of the classical age, and later, as the most important works in Ancient Greek literature, and were the basis of Greek pedagogy in antiquity. As the center of the rhapsode's repertoire, their recitation was a central part of Greek religious festivals. The book would be spoken or sung all night (modern readings last around 14 hours), with audiences coming and going for parts they particularly enjoyed.

Throughout much of their history, scholars of the ''written'' word treated the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' as literary poems, and oral modes of thought and communication and their evolution under the impact of print by Eric Havelock, Marshall McLuhan, Walter Ong and others. In fact, Parry's student Albert Lord, in his landmark work ''The Singer of Tales'', detects similarities between the tragic story of Patroclus and the death of Enkidu in the Sumerian ''Epic of Gilgamesh''. In the book, Lord refutes the idea that the Patroclus story-line upsets the "established" Homeric pattern of "wrath, bride-stealing, and rescue"<ref>Lord, Albert. ''The Singer of Tales'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1960. p. 190</ref> and says that the structure of the 
''Iliad'' is dictated by "a careful analysis of the repetition of thematic patterns."<ref>Lord, Albert. ''The Singer of Tales'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1960. p. 195</ref>

It should be noted, however, that the use of repetition and stock phrases has not necessarily been interpreted as a restriction on Homer's originality and capacity to rework the story as he saw fit.  Professor James Armstrong, in his paper The Arming Motif in the Iliad, argues that even formulaic sections of Homer's text contain enriched meaning through illustrative word choice.  He points to what he refers to as the “arming motif;” characters such as Paris, Agamemnon, Patroclus, and Achilles are all described while being armed in a formulaic, long-winded fashion.  Armstrong writes that this is needed to “heighten the importance of…an impressive moment” while the repetition “creates an atmosphere of smoothness.”  Yet each time, he modifies elements of the passages – for example, when describing Patroclus<ref>''Iliad'' XVI 130-154</ref>, he changes from a positive to a negative turn of phrase, which Armstrong explains as demonstrating that Patroclus is not Achilles, foreshadowing Patroclus’ death.<ref>Armstrong, James I.  ''The Arming Motif in the Iliad''.  The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 79, No. 4. (1958), pp. 337-354.</ref>

One of the effects that oral tradition has had on the Iliad is that the poem sometimes has inconsistency.  For example, Aphrodite is described as “laughter-loving” even when she is in pain from the wound given to her by Diomedes (5.375).  Oral tradition has also been a reason attributed for the ''Iliad'''s break from the view of the gods the Greeks in Homer's time actually had.  In the ''Iliad'', Mycenaean elements have become mixed up with Dark Age elements.  For example, the most powerful Olympic gods have been compared to the Dark Ages’ hereditary basilees nobles who ruled over lesser social ranks, paralleling lesser gods like Scamander<ref>Toohey, Peter.  Reading Epic: An Introduction to the Ancient Narrative.  New Fetter Lane, London: Routledge, 1992.</ref>.

==The relationship of Achilles and Patroclus==

thumb|right|200px|Achilles and Patroclus.
The precise nature of the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus has been the subject of some dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the ''Iliad'', it is clear that the two heroes have a deep and extremely meaningful friendship, but the evidence of a romantic or sexual element is equivocal. Commentators from the classical period to today have tended to interpret the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. Thus, in fifth-century Athens the relationship was commonly interpreted as pederastic, since pederasty was an accepted part of Athenian society. Present day readers are more likely to interpret the two heroes either as non-sexual ''war buddies'' or as a similarly-aged homosexual couple.

==Warfare in the ''Iliad''==
Even though Mycene was a maritime power that managed to launch over a thousand ships and Troy at the very least had built the fleet with which Paris took Helen,<ref>''Iliad'' 3.45–50</ref> no sea-battle takes place throughout the conflict and Phereclus, the shipbuilder of Troy, fights on foot.<ref>''Iliad'' 5.59–65</ref>

The heroes of the ''Iliad'' are dressed in elaborate and well described armor. They ride to the battle field on a Telamonian Ajax carried a large tower-shaped shield (σάκος) that was used not only to cover him but also his brother:

:Ninth came Teucer, stretching his curved bow. 
:He stood beneath the shield of Ajax, son of Telamon.
:As Ajax cautiously pulled his shield aside,
:Teucer would peer out quickly, shoot off an arrow,
:hit someone in the crowd, dropping that soldier
:right where he stood, ending his life—then he'd duck back, 
:crouching down by Ajax, like a child beside its mother.
:Ajax would then conceal him with his shining shield.
: (''Iliad'' 8.267–272, translated by Ian Johnston)
