'''''Armed and Dangerous''''' (1986) is a movie starring John Candy as Frank Dooley, Eugene Levy as Norman Kane, Robert Loggia as Michael Carlino and Meg Ryan as Maggie Cavanaugh.  The plot involves Dooley, a police officer and Kane, a criminal defense attorney, recently drummed out of their respective professions. Frank Dooley loses his job as a police officer after he catches two corrupt officers stealing a television set. He refuses to join in with them, so they overpower him and fabricate a story which gets Dooley fired. Kane seeks new employment after unsuccessfully defending a Charles Manson-like character, inspiring the presiding judge to pronounce him the worst lawyer he has ever seen after lamely claiming that his obviously insane client "didn't mean" to commit his various crimes. 

The film's premise involves the pair uncovering a scheme formulated by the security guard union's leaders (who collect $15 from each worker's weekly paycheck) to embezzle the money for their own personal gain. The pair are assigned to guard a toxic waste site as punishment after clashing with the union leaders, who refuse to answer questions about the status of the pension's fund.

The main source of the film's comedy comes from the interactions between Dooley and Kane, and the various mishaps and close-calls that befall the pair on their journey. There is also a romantic interest between Kane and Cavanaugh, although there does not seem to be much on-screen chemistry between the two.

The film was released in the United States on August 15 of 1986, and is set in Los Angeles, California during the 1980s.

==Quotes==
The Cowboy: "Slim, I ain't never seen a handgun that big before!"<br>
Frank Dooley: "It's a fifty caliber. They used to use this to hunt buffalo with... up close.  It's only legal in two states... and this isn't one of 'em."

Norman Kane (defending a client, speaking to the judge): "I sincerely feel that the facts are completely irrelevant in this case."

Applicant: Where it says police record, does that mean felonies or misdemeanors?
Clarence Cavanaugh: Both.
Applicant: Oh...can I write on the back here? I'm not gonna have enough room.
Clarence Cavanaugh: We've got lots of extra papers if you need 'em.

Norman Kane: "What I mean is, if I arrest someone who later turns out to be innocent, and he sues me for a million dollars, what happens?" Clarence Cavanaugh: "What happens? You spend the rest of your life paying for it. And you die, miserable and broke. So don't screw up."

Clarence Cavanaugh: The world is a shithole. Full of shitty little scumbags who are scared shitless.

Frank Dooley: (''looks at other applicant'') Do you think he's a little anal?
Applicant: (''dryly'') I think he's right.

Captain O'Connell: "You work ten hours, you make forty-six dollars."
Dooley: "Now... let me get this straight. If I worked say, three billion hours, I could pull in over twelve billion dollars, roughly?" (quickly adding) "I mean, if I was eager enough and I put the time in."

Judge: Mr. Kane, you are without a doubt, one of the worst lawyers I've ever seen.
Norman Kane: Oh, well then, I move for a mistrial.
Judge: SHUT UP!
Norman Kane: Yessir.
