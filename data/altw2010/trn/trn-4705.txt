Originally a quartet, the group eventually became a trio, which includes twin sisters Irish (born June 2, 1980), and Orish Grinstead (born June 2, 1980, died April 20, 2008)<ref name=nsl> </ref>, their sister LeMisha 'Misha' Grinstead (born June 10, 1978) and lead singer Kameelah 'Meelah' Williams (born March 8, 1978) who left the group in 2001 to start her own solo career but returned in 2003.

==History==
===Beginnings===
In Nevada, sisters LeMisha and Irish Grinstead, and their friend Kameelah Williams, were students at Cheyenne High School in North Las Vegas.  Whenever a big boxing match was in town, the Grinstead sisters would hang out in the lobby of Sinbad, happened to walk by. Though not a music producer, he recognized how talented the Grinsteads were and visited their home in order to convince their parents to send the trio to Atlanta for a convention and music competition.  Though the girls missed the deadline for entry, Sinbad used his name to get them in.<ref name=nsl/> "Sweeta than Suga," as they were then called (Sinbad suggested the name), came in second in the competition.  As the convention was nearing a close, the sisters happened to see Michael Bivins (formerly of New Edition and Bell Biv DeVoe) passing by and persuaded him to listen.  He later said that he thought he had found his own version of the Supremes.  With the crowd that had gathered egging him on, Bivins agreed to work with the talented girls.  After 702 made their recorded debut on Subway's hit single "This Lil' Game We Play" in the video Orish is the one standing nest to Irish at the beginning. (Originally, there were 4 members: sisters Irish, LeMisha, Irish's twin sister Orish & their cousin Amelia), Amelia Grinstead dropped out of the group<ref name=nsl/> and was replaced by LeMisha and Irish's & Orish's good friend Kameelah Williams, then after recording a few demos as a quartet even "Steelo", and "Get It Together", Orish decided to leave the group. while Bivins continued to work with different producers and songwriters to get the right feel for their first album.  The new group was christened "702," which is Las Vegas' area code, a name which Bivens suggested. <ref name=nsl/>

===1996–1998: Rise to fame===

Their debut album, ''No Doubt'' shot to #1 on Nickelodeon television show ''Rampage.  "My Friend" was featured on the soundtrack to "Sister, Sister and Moesha.

===1999–2000: Career development===

After going gold with their debut album, they released their self-titled second album, ''702''.  The first single off of the album "Where My Girls At?" was written and produced by WNBA season opener. 702 was also apart of Brandy's Never say Never tour. On June 18th, 702's LeMisha gave birth to her son Tony Lyndon and left in order to take care of her son. Orish took her place during LeMisha's brief absence.  They also made a cameo in the 1999 ABC-TV movie "Brandy and Where My Girls At? did" . In 2000, 702 along with Eric Benét was Brian McKnight's opening act for his tour supporting his album Back at One. On November 4, 2002, 702's second album had finally gone platinum.

===2000-2002: Hiatus and "Pootie Tangin"===
Once the hype for the second album died down, 702 took a hiatus from the spotlight. Kameelah Williams decided to part from the group and go solo.  She briefly became the new protégé of Total but was later denied.

The Grinstead sisters, the remaining members of 702, decided to retake their place in the spotlight and enlisted Cree Lamore to replace Meelah. Under the revamped 702, they recorded the lead single "Pootie Tangin" for the Chris Rock movie, Pootie Tang. In the video you can see Irish and Cree sharing lead vocals. "Pootie Tangin" failed to make any charts but earned them a 2002 Soul Train Lady Of Soul Award nomination.

===2002-2003: Return to music===

Kameelah reunited with 702 once again to record their third album.  However, promotion for this album was poor and resulted in a flop.  After the less-than-successful album, the girls decided to go their separate ways.  Irish made her movie acting debut in the 2004 flim ''The Brewster Project'' as "Alicia".
