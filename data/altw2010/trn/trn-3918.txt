==Reported Apparition of the Virgin Mary==

In 1980, Bernardo Martinez, sacristan, claimed to have a series of visions of the Virgin Mary. According to Bernardo, this began on April 15th when he saw a strange light emanating from a statue of the Virgin Mary in the parish church. In May, when walking through the fields, he claimed that he saw a vision of the Virgin Mary, who encouraged him to pray the rosary and promote peace saying: "Make Peace. Don't ask Our Lord for peace because, if you do not make it, there will be no peace." <ref>Miriam and Stephen Weglian, "Let Heaven and Earth Unite", page 24, Faith Publishing Company, Milford Ohio, 1996</ref>

At this time, Nicaragua was going through a civil war. The Sandinista government was facing armed opposition from the Contras. Bernardo Martinez claimed that the Virgin Mary ordered him to burn bad books, which was interpreted to mean Marxist books. The auxiliary Bishop of Managua complied with this request. Sandinista commentators responded by describing the apparition as 'St. Mary of the Contras' and 'Our Lady of Oliver North'.<ref>[http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/3184 "Nicaragua Church-State Relations A Chronology - Part II"]</ref>

On November 13th 1982, the Bishop of Juigalpa released an official statement as Bishop of the area where the apparitions took place assuring the faithful of the authenticity of the events. The apparitions at San Francisco de Cuapa are thus among the few Marian apparitions approved by the Catholic Church in the twentieth century.<ref>[http://www.miraclehunter.com/marian_apparitions/statements/index.html#cuapa Miracle Hunter web-site]</ref>

In 2005, Silvio Sirias wrote a novel, "Bernardo and the Virgin" based on these events. <ref>Silvio Sirias, Bernardo and the Virgin, Northwestern University Press, 2005 ISBN 978-0810124271</ref>
