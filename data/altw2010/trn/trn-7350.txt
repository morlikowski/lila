Tampa is a part of the metropolitan area most commonly referred to as the "Tampa Bay Area."  For U.S. Census purposes, Tampa is part of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida MSA.  The four-county area is composed of roughly 3 million residents, making it the second largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the state, and the third largest in the Southeastern United States behind Miami and Atlanta. The "Greater Tampa Bay" area has just over 4 million residents and generally includes the Tampa and Sarasota metro areas. The Tampa Bay Partnership and U.S. Census data showed an average annual growth of 2.47 percent, or a gain of approximately 97,000 residents per year. Between 2000 and 2006, the Greater Tampa Bay Market has experienced a combined growth rate of 14.8 percent, growing from 3.4 million to 3.9 million and hitting the 4 million people mark on April 1, 2007.<ref>

==History==

The word "Tampa" is believed to mean "sticks of fire" in the language of the Native American tribe that once lived south of today’s Toponymist George R. Stewart writes that the name was the result of a miscommunication between the Spanish and the Indians, the Indian word being "itimpi", meaning simply "near it" (Stewart, pg. 231).

===Early explorations===
Because they did not leave written records, not much is known about the cultures who called the Tampa Bay area home before European contact. When the first Spanish explorers arrived in the 1520s, they found a ring of Tocobaga villages around the northern half of Tampa Bay from modern-day Pinellas County to Tampa and Calusa villages along the southern portion of the bay in modern-day Manatee County <ref>Milanich, Jerald T. 1995. ''Florida Indians and the Invasion from Europe''. University Press of Florida. ISBN 0-8130-1360-7</ref>.

Expeditions led by  Pánfilo de Narváez and Hernando de Soto landed near Tampa to look for gold and possibly start a colony. But neither Catholicism.

However, the newcomers brought a weapon against which the natives had no defense: infectious disease. Archeological evidence reveals a total collapse of the native cultures of Florida in the years after European contact. Its native villages abandoned and disregarded by its colonial owners, the Tampa area would be depopulated and ignored for more than 200 years.

===Seasonal residents and U.S control===
In the mid-1700s, events in England’s American colonies drove the Seminole Indians into the wilds of north Florida. During this period, the Tampa area began receiving (seasonal) residents: Cuban fishermen. These visitors stayed in temporary settlements on the shore of Tampa Bay along a small freshwater stream near today’s Hyde Park neighborhood. They would spend several weeks catching a large haul of fish from the teeming waters of the bay, then take them back to sell in Spanish Cuba.<ref>

In 1821, the United States purchased Florida from Spain (see Adams-Onís Treaty), mainly to end frontier Indians raids and to stem the tide of escaped slaves fleeing into Florida from neighboring states. In fact, one of the first official U.S. actions in the new territory was a raid which destroyed Angola, a village built by escaped slaves on the eastern shore of Tampa Bay.

===Frontier days===
left|thumb|[[Tampa Convention Center, built at the site of Fort Brooke at the mouth of the Hillsborough River (on the far left) ]]
===Birth of a pioneer town===
The Treaty of Moultrie Creek (1823) created a large Indian reservation in the interior of the peninsular Florida. As part of efforts to establish control over the vast swampy wilderness, the U.S. government built a series of forts and trading posts throughout the new territory. "Cantonment Brooke" was established in 1823 by Colonels George Mercer Brooke and James Gadsden at the mouth of the Hillsborough River on Tampa Bay, at what is now the site of the Tampa Convention Center in Downtown Tampa. In 1824, the post was officially christened Fort Brooke.

Tampa, as the tiny village of settlers near the fort was dubbed, was very much an isolated frontier outpost during its first decades of existence. The sparse civilian population practically abandoned the area when the Second Seminole War flared up in late 1835. After almost seven years of vicious fighting, the Seminoles were forced away from the Tampa region and many settlers returned.

The Territory of census count in 1850 listed Tampa-Fort Brooke as having 974 residents.<ref>[http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1850c-11.pdf 1850 Census of Population]</ref> Tampa was reincorporated as a town on December 15, 1855, and Judge Joseph B. Lancaster became the first Mayor in 1856.<!--<ref>http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Clerk/previous_mayors/index.asp</ref><ref>http://www.tampagov.net/dept_city_clerk/archives/Records/City_of_Tampa_Incorporation_History.asp</ref>-->

===Tampa during the Civil War===
thumb|Barracks and tents at Fort Brooke in Tampa Bay
During the American Civil War, Florida seceded along with the rest of the South to form the Confederate States of America. Fort Brooke was manned by Confederate troops and martial law was declared in Tampa in January of 1862. Tampa's city government ceased to operate for the duration of the war.<ref>

In late 1861, the Union navy set up a blockade around many southern ports to cut off the Confederacy from outside help, and several ships were stationed near the mouth of Tampa Bay. However, blockade runners based in Tampa were able to repeatedly slip through the blockade to trade cattle and citrus for needed supplies, mainly with Spanish Cuba.<ref>

Trying to put a stop to this, Union gunboats sailed up Tampa Bay to bombard Fort Brooke and the surrounding city of Tampa. The Battle of Tampa on June 30-July 1, 1862 was inconclusive, as the shells fell ineffectually and there were no casualties on either side.<ref>

Much more damaging to the Confederate cause was the Battle of Fort Brooke on October 17-18, 1863. Two Union gunboats shelled the fort and surrounding town and landed troops, who found blockade runners hidden up the Hillsborough River and destroyed them.<ref name=historycenter>

The local militia mustered to intercept the Union troops, but they were able to return to their ships after a short skirmish and headed back out to sea.

The war ended in Confederate defeat in April 1865. In May, federal troops arrived in Tampa to occupy the fort and the town as part of Reconstruction. They would remain until August, 1869.<ref name=historycenter/>

===The Lean Years===
The years after the Civil War were difficult ones in Tampa. With little industry and land transportation links limited to bumpy wagon roads from the east coast of Florida, Tampa was a small sleepy fishing village with very few people and poor prospects for development.

Then came yellow fever. Borne by mosquitos from the surrounding swampland, Tampa was hit by wave after wave of yellow fever epidemics and scares throughout the late 1860s and 1870s. The disease was little understood at the time, and many residents simply packed up and left rather than face the mysterious and deadly peril.

A telling moment occurred in 1869, when residents voted to abolish the City of Tampa government.<ref>

</ref> The population of "Tampa Town" was below 800 in the official 1870 census count and had fallen further by 1880. (see demographics, below). The little village was dying.

Another blow was to come. Fort Brooke, the seed from which Tampa had germinated, had served its purpose and was decommissioned in 1883. Except for two cannons displayed on the nearby University of Tampa campus, all traces of the fort are gone. In an odd nod to history, a large downtown parking garage near the old fort site is called the Fort Brooke Parking Garage.<ref>

===Phosphate, Railroads, and Cigars: Tampa Finally Prospers===
Then, out of the blue, Tampa's fortunes took several sudden turns for the better. First, phosphate was discovered in the Bone Valley region southeast of Tampa in 1883. The mineral, which is vital for the production of fertilizers and other products, was soon being shipped out from the Port of Tampa in ever increasing volume. Tampa is still one of the world's leading phosphate exporters.
thumb|left|A plaque dedicated to the founding of the cigar industry in Tampa
Henry B. Plant's railroad line reached Tampa and its port shortly thereafter, connecting the small town to the country's railroad system. Tampa finally had the overland transportation link that had been so sorely lacking. The railroad enabled phosphate and commercial fishing exports to go north <ref>[http://www.baysoundings.com/sum05/phosphate4.html About Bone Valley<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, brought many new products into the Tampa market, and started the first real tourist industry: visitors coming in modest numbers to Henry Plant's first Tampa-area resort built literally on Tampa Bay on stilts. (This was not the still-standing Tampa Bay Hotel, which came a few years later).

The new railroad link enabled another important industry to come to Tampa. In 1885, the Tampa Board of Trade helped broker a land deal with Vicente Martinez Ybor to move his cigar manufacturing operations to Tampa from Key West. Close proximity to Cuba made imports of tobacco easy by sea, and Plant's railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the US market easy by land.

Since Tampa was still a small town at the time (population less than 5000), Ybor built hundreds of small houses around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of mainly Spanish cigar workers. Other cigar factories soon moved in, and Italian and a few eastern European Sicilian towns with which Tampa still maintains strong ties.

thumb|right|Franklin Street, looking North, Tampa c. 1910s-1920s
thumb|left|The [[Moorish Revival Tampa Bay Hotel]]
In 1891, Tampa Bay Hotel among  of manicured gardens along the banks Hillsborough River. The eclectic structure cost $2.5 million to build, a huge sum in those days. Plant filled his expensive playground with exotic art collectables from around the world and installed electric lights and the first elevator in town.

The resort did great business for a few years, especially during the Spanish-American War (see below). But with Plant's death in 1899, the hotel's fortunes began to fade. It closed in 1930. In 1933, however, the stately building reopened as the University of Tampa. 

Mainly because of Henry Plant's connections in the War Department, Tampa was chosen as an embarkation center for American troops in the Spanish-American War. Lieutenant Colonel Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders were among the 30,000 troops who waited in Tampa for the order to ship out to Cuba during the summer of 1898, filling the town to bursting <ref>http://www.tampabayhistorycenter.org/spanam.htm</ref>. Those months, while unpleasant for the troops wearing thick wool uniforms in the oppressive Florida heat, were a great boon to Tampa's growing economy. It was also the only time when Plant's Tampa Bay Hotel was full to capacity.

The founding of Ybor City, the building of Plant's railroad and hotels, and the discovery of phosphate - all within a dozen years in the late 1800s - were crucial to Tampa's development. The town suddenly expanded from sleepy backwater village to bustling town to small city. Except for temporary bumps along the way, this growth has continued unabated.

===The 20th century===
During the first few decades of the 20th century, the cigar making industry continued to be the backbone of Tampa's economy. The factories in Ybor City and West Tampa made an enormous number of cigars -- in the peak year of 1929, over 500,000,000 cigars were hand rolled in the city.<ref>Ybor City: The Making of a Landmark Town by Frank Lastra</ref> As the market for cigars began to wane during the Great Depression, other industries came to the fore, especially shipping and, of course, tourism.

In 1904, a local civic association of local businessmen dubbed themselves Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla (named after local mythical pirate Jose Gaspar), and staged an "invasion" of the city followed by a parade. With a few exceptions, the Gasparilla Pirate Festival has been held every year since.

===Bolita & the Mob===
Beginning in the late 1800s, illegal bolita lotteries were very popular among the Tampa working classes, especially in Ybor City. In the early 1920s, this small-time operation was taken over by Charlie Wall, the rebellious son of a prominent Tampa family, and went big-time.

The era of rampant and open corruption ended in the 1950s, when the Senator Kefauver's traveling organized crime hearings came to town and were followed by the sensational misconduct trials of several local officials. Though many of the worst offenders in government and the mob were not charged, the trials helped to end the sense of lawlessness which had prevailed in Tampa for decades.

There were four attempts to consolidate Tampa with Hillsborough County (1967, 1970, 1971, and 1972), all of which failed at the ballot box; the biggest margin was 33,160 for and 73,568 against the proposed charter in 1972.<ref>http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04152005-170723/unrestricted/05_lsj_CHAPTER_4_b.pdf</ref>

The biggest recent growth in the city was the development of New Tampa, which started in 1988 when the city annexed a 24-square mile (mostly rural) area between I-275 and I-75. Since then, many subdivisions and thousands of homes and businesses have filled in, accounting for much of Tampa's population growth over that time.

East Tampa, which has historically been a mostly black community, was the scene of several riots, mainly due to problems between residents and the Tampa police.

==Geography & Climate==
Tampa is located on the West coast of Florida at  (27.970898, -82.464640).
thumb|left|Tampa Bay Landsat image.
===Topography===
According to the Hillsborough Bay, which both flow to form Hillsborough River flows out into Hillsborough Bay, passing directly in front of Downtown Tampa and supplying Tampa with its main source of water. The Palm River is a smaller river flowing from just east of the city into Hillsborough Bay.

===Climate===

Tampa has a °F (18 and 35 °C) year round. Surprisingly to some, Tampa's official recorded high has never hit 100 °F (38 °C) - the all-time record high temperature is 99 °F (37 °C), recorded on June 5, 1985.<ref>[http://weather.yahoo.com/climo/USFL0481_f.html Tampa Weather Forecasts on Yahoo! Weather<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In the winter, the low rarely drops below freezing (32 °F , 0 °C), an occurrence which happens, on average, once every other year. Since the Tampa area is home to a diverse range of freeze-sensitive agriculture and aquaculture, cold snaps are a major worry. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Tampa was 18 °F (-7.8 °C) on December 13, 1962.<ref>

Temperatures are hot from around mid-May through mid-October, which coincides approximately with the rainy season. Summer days usually have highs in the low 90s °F (32-34 °C) with high humidity. The summer nighttime temperature usually drops into the mid 70s °F (21 - 23 °C).<ref>[http://www.wordtravels.com/Cities/Florida/Tampa/Climate Tampa climate and weather, Florida, Rainfall Temperature Climate and Weather<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Thunderstorms are a common summertime feature in Tampa. These afternoon boomers can sometimes become severe, bringing gusty winds, small hail, and torrential rain. Tornadoes are rare, but not unheard of. The biggest danger they bring is lightning. 

The Tampa Bay area is recognized as the "Lightning Capital of North America". Every year, Florida averages 10 deaths and 30 injuries from lightning strikes, with several of these usually occurring in or around Tampa.<ref>[http://www2.sptimes.com/weather/SW.1.html Lightning capital of the nation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> With each thunderstorm capable of unleashing thousands of individual bolts, weather safety experts recommend staying inside until the weather clears.<ref>

The most common summertime weather pattern is for heat-produced thermals to turn puffy white cumulus clouds into threatening thunderheads over the interior of the Florida peninsula. The typical wind pattern usually pushes these storms slowly westward toward the Tampa area. Sometimes they rain themselves out before making it to the coast; on many summer days in Tampa Bay, a stormy afternoon is followed by a pleasantly clear and cooler (though not exactly cool) evening. But occasionally the storms survive to move out over the Gulf of Mexico at night, where they can be seen from the beaches as spectacular light shows. 

A westerly or southwesterly wind flow, however, will bring even more humidity than usual into the air. On those days, rain and thunder can strike anywhere at any time around Tampa Bay.

Because of these regular summer storms, Tampa has a pronounced wet season, averaging 20.6 inches (524 mm) between July and September, but only 6.2 inches (157 mm) between November and January.  The wettest month is August, which averages 7.6 inches (193 mm). (August and especially September rain totals are augmented by tropical systems, which easily can dump many inches of rain in one day.) November is Tampa's driest month, averaging only 1.6 inches (41 mm). During the winter, most of the area's precipitation is delivered by the occasional cold front. Yearly precipitation averages 44.8 inches (1137 mm).<ref></ref>

Another of Mayor Iorio's initiatives is the Tampa Riverwalk, a plan which intends to make better use of the land along the Hillsborough River in downtown where Tampa began. Several museums are part of the plan, including new homes for the Tampa Bay History Center, the Tampa Children's Museum, and the Tampa Museum of Art.
