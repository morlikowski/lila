'''''Ratchet: Deadlocked''''', titled as '''''Ratchet: Gladiator''''' in platform/shooter video game developed by published by Sony. It is the fourth game in the ''Ratchet & Clank'' series and is the sequel to ''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal''. It was released on October 25, 2005 in North America. Although it was met with generally positive reviews, ''Ratchet: Deadlocked'' received some criticism from fans as it is noticeably darker and more combat oriented in terms of gameplay than previous ''Ratchet & Clank'' games, and Clank was reduced to a non-playable side character.

== Plot ==

The beginning of ''Deadlocked'' contains a cutscene showing a brutal sport in which contestants try to kill each other, that resembles ''Battle Royale''.  Called ''Dreadzone'', it is a very large part of the story.  After saving the galaxy once again, Ratchet and Clank are given the job of running the Starship Phoenix, with Al for back-up if need be. When Sasha, the new mayor of Metropolis, phones in and informs the crew of the death of Captain Starshield and the fact that many heroes are being abducted, robots approach the Phoenix and overrun it, taking Ratchet, Clank, and Al captive. 

They are transported to the Shadow Sector, a lawless region on the fringe of the Solana Galaxy. Here, Ratchet meets Gleeman Vox, the president/creator of Dreadzone which is shown on Vox Entertainment (a massive media empire within the Shadow Sector and parody of Fox Entertainment), who reveals that Ratchet is now being forced to compete in the reality holovision show, ''DreadZone''. Ratchet is now wearing a "DeadLock" collar that will shock him if he strays into restricted areas or detonate if he becomes uncooperative or boring. 

Collectively referred to as "Team DarkStar", Al serves as the mechanic for Ratchet's combat bots, Merc and Green, while Clank serves as his "Mission Control", similar to an Operator from the ''Matrix'' film series. Ratchet and the combat bots (or a second player) compete across a series of Battlecourses, and a series of tournaments in the BattleDome at DreadZone Station, clearing challenge after challenge, while Ratchet, already framed of many disturbing attributes, becomes one of the most infamous contestants in ''DreadZone'' history. However, Ratchet enjoys great popularity with the viewers.

Ratchet's most notable victories are against the DreadZone Exterminators, a group of contestants who no longer compete normally, but serve as bosses during the tournaments and kill competing heroes. He defeats ShellShock on Planet Kronos, then Reactor, The Eviscerator, and Ace Hardlight (the Captain of the Exterminators) in separate BattleDome tournaments earning higher ranks: Marauder, Avenger, Crusader, Vindicator, and Liberator.

Following his defeat by Ratchet, Ace, as he lays dying in the BattleDome, says to Ratchet, "Don't...let Vox do to you...what he did to me."  Ratchet is then taken to see Gleeman Vox. He claims to have been trying to make Ratchet a star; an ironic claim, because Vox's reporters Dallas and Juanita have been slandering Ratchet most of the time. Vox tells Ratchet that it was just "building up his bad boy image", and he offers to make Ratchet the new Captain of the Exterminators, and Ratchet (who is disgusted by the idea of making a living by killing other heroes) refuses, saying, "You actually think I'd kill other heroes to get rich? You're not just corrupt, you're stupid." 

Stating that Ratchet has signed his own death warrant, Vox has him escorted from the room, and requests that they be sent to the "Gauntlet of Doom" located at the Ghost Station battlecourse, despite protests from the testbot whom he gave the order to that "...it was mathematically proven to be. ..unbeatable." This was justified to ''DreadZone'' fans via a hoax news report that Ratchet was using banned performance-enhancing drugs, showing his head on a muscular body.

After Ratchet successfully runs the Gauntlet of Doom and demolishes the Ghost Station, he returns to his ''DreadZone'' containment area, and Clank tells him that he has found a way to shut down the containment fields holding the heroes hostage. Al makes his return as a cyborg (he had previously been shot by Ace Hardlight after the third tournament, when he succeeded in deactivating Clank's DeadLock collar), and tells Ratchet what he needs to do; take a reprogrammed shuttle to the BattleDome's control level and destroy the central computer, but, as Clank puts it, "it is a one-way ride".

After his arrival at the control level, Ratchet finds out that Vox was luring Ratchet into yet another trap. Stating boldly that the BattleDome is wired with "six gigatons of nitroglycerin", Vox says that Ratchet will be responsible for the death of everyone there if he fails.  After Vox announces this atrocity, Ratchet's 'bad boy image' is completely erased, and Ratchet is assured that, as Juanita says, "We're rooting for you, little buddy."

Running a massive gauntlet of enemies and destroying each of three power generators, Ratchet manages to deactivate the containment fields and simultaneously unlocks DreadZone Station's escape shuttles. Ratchet's final battle with Gleeman Vox follows, which as Vox says, "It's a little one-act play I call 'Death of a Lombax'", first against Vox in a hoverpod that represents a Dreadzone Laser Back, then against a giant mech which Vox docks his hoverpod into, giving him more powers.

After his defeat, Vox reactivates the self-destruct sequence via remote control, stating to Ratchet that "The escape shuttles all left long ago. Now we'll die together, on live holovision. It'll be the best ratings I've ever had!"

However, Ratchet is spared a horrible death when the last shuttle (piloted by Al) swoops in to rescue him. He grabs Vox's pet, Slugga, and leaps aboard with Merc and Green, where Clank wastes no time removing his DeadLock collar, which he then tosses out the airlock. The collar explodes, followed shortly by DreadZone Station itself. Other gladiators including Kid Nova, Hydro Girl, Agent Zero(he was never seen but mentioned on the Rank-o-Meter) and many others escaped and call to thank Ratchet for saving them.

After the end credits, Dr. Nefarious and Lawrence (from the previous game) make a cameo appearance still stuck on an asteroid with Dr. Nefarious complaining that they were coming within range of a space station (DreadZone Station), which, as Lawrence questioned, suddenly exploded. Nefarious then breaks out into a raging fit, shortly followed by a soap opera audio (See ''Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal'')

'''Ratchet: Gladiator''', ook bekend als '''Ratchet: Deadlocked''' (in de VS) is een Sony. Het is het vierde spel in de serie van ''Ratchet & Clank''. Het spel werd in de VS uitgebracht op 25 oktober 2005. In Nederland kwam het spel uit op 18 november 2005.

==Verhaal==
Het begin van ''Gladiator'' bevat een scène waarin deelnemers aan een programma elkaar proberen te vermoorden. Het programma heet '''DreadZone'''. Een groot deel van het verhaal speelt zich af alsof het hoofdkarakter Ratchet meedoet aan ''Dreadzone'' en de speler thuis meekijkt op televisie. Ratchet en Clank zijn aan boord van het ''Starship Phoenix'', uit ''Ratchet and Clank 3''. Sasha, de aanvoerder van ''Starship Phoenix'', krijgt bericht over dat ''Captain Starshield'' is vermoord en ze wil dat Ratchet en Clank gaan uitzoeken wat het is.

Ratchet en Clank komen terecht in de ''Shadow Sector'', een regio in het ''Solana Galaxy'' waar geen wetten zijn. Daar ontmoet Ratchet Gleeman Vox, de voorzitter en bedenker van ''DreadZone''. Dreadzone wordt uitgezonden op Vox Entertainment, een televisieomroep. Vox zegt dat Ratchet moet meedoen aan het reality holovisie programma ''DreadZone''.

Clank is in dit spel niet meer dan een karakter wat vertelt hoe Ratchet het best de missies van DreadZone kan winnen. Ratchet krijgt wel twee hulpbots en samen vormen ze ''Team DarkStar''. Ratchet wordt een van de meest gehate deelnemers aan ''DreadZone'' in de geschiedenis voor de presentatoren Juanita en Dallas. De kijkers vinden hem echter geweldig.

De meest geprezen overwinningen van Ratchet zijn die, als hij wint van een ''Exterminator'', een groep deelnemers die niet meer normaal meedoen, maar dienen als eindbazen in de toernooien en die deelnemende helden vermoorden. Ratchet verslaat ''ShellShock'' op planeet Kronos, daarna ''Reactor'', de ''Eviscerator'' en ''Ace Hardlight'', de aanvoerder van de Exterminators. Door het verslaan van Exterminators krijgt Ratchet een betere uitrusting, waardoor hij minder schade oploopt als hij wordt aangevallen door vijanden.
