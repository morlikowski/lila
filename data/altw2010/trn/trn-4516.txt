'''Tucumán''' is a province of Salta, Santiago del Estero and Catamarca. It is nicknamed "El Jardín de la República" (''The Republic's Garden'').

==History==

Before the Spanish colonization, this land was inhabited by the Diaguitas and Calchaquíes, who practiced agriculture.

In 1533 Diego de Almagro explored the malones.

The local aborigines of the region presented a strong resistance to the Spanish, who decided to move the defeated tribes towards Quilmes, who were moved to the city of Quilmes.

Tucumán was a mid-point for shipments of gold and silver from the Viceroyalty of Peru, with important cattle, textile, and wood activities that provided supplies for the convoys on their way to Buenos Aires. Because of its important geographical position, and as head of the civil and Catholic governments it acquired special importance during the 18th century.

The creation of the British imports from the newly opened customs of Buenos Aires, no longer under the monopoly of the Spanish Crown.

In 1783 the Intendency of Tucumán was divided and Tucumán was set under the control of the Intendency of Salta del Tucumán, with its centre in Salta.

San Martín arrived to Tucumán in 1813 and installed the Military School. In 1814 the Intendency of Salta was divided into the present provinces.

On Congreso de Tucumán'', the ''Provincias Unidas del Río de la Plata'' ("United Provinces of the Río de la Plata") declared their independence from Spain, but internal conflicts delayed the final fusion of the provinces into the ''República Argentina''.

The beginning of the 20th century, with the customs restrictions and the arrival of the railway, brought prosperous economic times for the province, and its sugarcane production;but, the sugar price crisis of the 1960s led President Juan Carlos Ongania to have a large state-owned sugar mill closed in 1966, hitting Tucumán's economy hard.  

The next decade saw mounting unrest, in part due to economic hardship, and in 1975, Pres. Gen. Domingo Bussi as governor at the the behest of the dictatorship that deposed Mrs. Peron in 1976.  Efficient as well as ruthless, Bussi oversaw the completion of several stalled public works; but, also presided over some of the worst human rights abuses during that painful 1976-77 period.

Life in Tucuman has since returned to a certain normalcy and, if well its economy languished during much of the 1980s and '90s, it has recovered strongly during the expansive period Argentina has seen since 2002.

==Geography==

In spite of the small size of Tucumán, its necessary to distinguish two different geographical systems. The east is associated to the Gran Chaco flat lands, while the west presents a mixture of the Sierras of the Pampas to the south, and the canyons of the Argentine Northwest to the north, being the highest peak the ''Cerro del Bolsón'' with 5,550 meters.

Warm sub-tropical temperatures rein almost all over the province, but the mountain region receives more than 1,500 mm of precipitations per year, in contrast with the 600 mm of the plains. This is due to the effect of the mountains on the humid winds from the Atlantic Ocean that elevate the wind to higher, and thus colder air, forcing the condensation of the humidity and later rain.
