'''Çöl çit kuşu''' (''Malurus cyaneus''), Maluridae familyasının en genel ve en alışılmış türüdür. Yerleşik ve yerel olarak Avusturalya'nın güneyinden doğusuna doğru bir bölgede görülmektedir.

== Taksonomi ==

Çöl çit kuşu, Malurus cinsine bağlı 12 türden biridir. Avusturalya ve Yeni Gine'nin alçak arazilerinde görülür.<ref name = "Rowley143">Rowley & Russell, p. 143</ref> Cins içinde çöl çit kuşunun en yakın akrabası Avusturalya çalı kuşlarıdır (''Malurus splendens''). Bu iki kuş türü aynı zamanda Avusturalya'nın kuzeybatısında görülen ''Malurus coronatus'' türü ile de yakın alakalıdır.<ref></ref>

The '''Superb Fairy-wren''' (''Malurus cyaneus''), also known as '''Superb Blue-wren''' or colloquially as '''Blue wren''', is a common and familiar territorial, it is found across south-eastern Australia. The species exhibits a high degree of sexual dimorphism; the male in breeding plumage has a striking bright blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle and tail with a black mask and black or dark blue throat. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression that males were polygamous as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. Two subspecies are recognised: the larger and darker Tasmanian form ''cyaneus'' and the smaller and paler mainland form ''cyanochlamys''.

Like other fairy-wrens, the Superb Fairy-wren is notable for several peculiar behavioural characteristics; birds are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display. 

The Superb Fairy-wren can be found in almost any area that has at least a little dense undergrowth for shelter, including grasslands with scattered shrubs, moderately thick forest, woodland, heaths, and domestic gardens. It has adapted well to the urban environment and is common in suburban Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. The Superb Fairy-wren mainly eats insects and supplements its diet with seeds.

==Taxonomy==
The Superb Fairy-wren is one of 12 species of the genus ''Malurus'', commonly known as fairy-wrens, found in Australia and lowland New Guinea.<ref name = "Rowley143">Rowley & Russell, p. 143</ref> Within the genus, the Superb Fairy-wren's closest relative is the Splendid Fairy-wren; these two "Blue wrens" are also related to the Purple-crowned Fairy-wren of northwestern Australia.<ref>

William Anderson, surgeon and naturalist on Captain James Cook's third voyage, collected the first Superb Fairy-wren specimen in 1777 while travelling off the coast of eastern Tasmania, in Bruny Island's Adventure Bay. He named it ''Motacilla cyanea'' because its tail reminded him of the European Wagtails of the genus ''Motacilla''. Anderson did not live to publish his findings, though his assistant William Ellis described the bird in 1782.<ref>Rowley & Russell, p. 8</ref> The genus ''Malurus'' was later described by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816, giving the bird its current scientific name.<ref></ref> 

Shortly after the Coorong regions called it ''Waatji pulyeri'', meaning "little one of the ''waatji'' (lignum) bush",<ref></ref> and the Gunai called it ''Deeydgun'', meaning "little bird with long tail".<ref></ref>

Like other fairy-wrens, the Superb Fairy-wren is unrelated to the true wren. It was previously classified as a member of the old world flycatcher family Muscicapidae<ref></ref><ref></ref> and later as a member of the warbler family Sylviidae<ref></ref> before being placed in the newly-recognised Maluridae in 1975.<ref></ref> More recently, DNA analysis has shown the Maluridae family to be related to the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), the Pardalotidae (pardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills, gerygones and allies), and the Petroicidae (Australian robins) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

===Subspecies===
Two subspecies are currently recognised, though future DNA studies may prompt reclassification.<ref name = "Rowley146">Rowley & Russell, p. 146</ref>

*'''''M. c. cyaneus''''', the nominate subspecies described in 1782,<ref name ="Ellis1782"></ref> is found throughout Tasmania and on the Bass Strait Islands. Birds are larger and darker than the mainland subspecies, with males having a deeper azure blue coloration. Those of King Island were first described as a separate species ''elizabethae'' by A.J. Campbell in 1901,<ref></ref> with a deeper blue colour still. Birds of Flinders Island are of intermediate colour between the King Island and Tasmanian forms.<ref name = "Rowley145">Rowley & Russell, p. 145</ref> Schodde in his 1982 review reclassified ''elizabethae'' under ''cyaneus''.<ref> <!--please check it is the correct ISBN--></ref>

*'''''M. c. cyanochlamys''''', described by Richard Sharpe in 1881,<ref></ref> is found on mainland Australia; in general, birds are smaller and paler than those of Tasmania, with Queensland male birds bearing a pale silvery blue crown, ear tufts and mantle.<ref name = "Rowley145"/>

===Evolutionary history===
In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde proposed a southern origin for the common ancestor of the Superb and Splendid Fairy-wrens. At some time in the past it was split into southwestern (Splendid) and southeastern (Superb) enclaves. As the southwest was dryer than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the Splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. In the east, the Superb Fairy-wren spread into Tasmania during a glacial period when the sea level was low and the island was connected with the rest of the continent via a landbridge. What gave rise to subspecies ''cyaneus'' became isolated as the sea levels rose. The Bass Strait forms were isolated from Tasmania but more recently and so their subspecific status was not maintained. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified.<ref name ="Schodde82">Schodde R (1982) ''The fairy-wrens: a monograph of the Maluridae''. Lansdowne Editions, Melbourne.</ref>

Wider than it is deep, the bill is similar in shape to those of other birds that feed by probing for or picking insects off their environs.<ref></ref>

Like other fairy-wrens, the Superb Fairy-wren is notable for its marked spectrum.<ref></ref>

thumb|right|Male vocalizing<br>subspecies ''cyanochlamys''
Vocal communication among Superb Fairy-wrens is used primarily for communication between birds in a social group and for advertising and defending a territory.<ref name ="Rowley63">Rowley & Russell, p. 63</ref> The basic, or Type I, song is a 1–4 second high-pitched reel consisting of 10–20 short elements per second; it is sung by both males and females.<ref name ="Rowley656">Rowley & Russell, p. 65–66</ref> Males also possess a peculiar song-like Type II vocalization, which is given in response to the calls of predatory birds, commonly Ethology'' 90'''(2)''':143–153.</ref> The purpose of this behavior, which does not elicit a response from other nearby wrens, remains unknown. It is not a warning call, but in fact gives away the location of the vocalizing male to the predator. It may serve to announce male fitness, but this is far from certain.<ref name ="Rowley68">Rowley & Russell, p. 68</ref> Superb Fairy-wrens' alarm call is a series of brief sharp ''chit''s, universally given and understood by small birds in response to predators. Females also emit a ''purr'' while incubating.<ref name ="Rowley146"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
The Superb Fairy-wren is common throughout most of the relatively wet and fertile south-eastern corner of the continent, from the south-east of Victoria, Dawson River and west to Blackall; it is a common bird in the suburbs of Hyde Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney's urbanized centre.<ref></ref> It is not found in dense forest nor in alpine environments.<ref name = "Rowley1478">Rowley & Russell, p. 147–48</ref> Forestry plantations of pine (''Pinus''  spp.) and eucalypts are also unsuitable as they lack undergrowth.<ref name ="Rowley134">Rowley & Russell, p. 134</ref>
