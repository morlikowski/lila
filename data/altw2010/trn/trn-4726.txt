"'''Joe le taxi'''" is a song written by Franck Langolff and French singer Vanessa Paradis' debut album, ''M&J'' (1988).

Paradis recorded the song in 1987, at the age of fourteen. It went on to top the singles chart in France for an unprecedented eleven weeks,<ref name=charts></ref> and, uncommon for a French song at that time, was released in the United Kingdom the following year, where it peaked at number three. The song was taken from her debut album, ''M&J'' (short for "Marilyn & John"), which, although peaking at number thirteen in France, drew no interest in Britain and did not peak.

==Story==
"Joe le taxi" is a song about a taxi driver, Joe, who works in Latin music and his Amazon. Spanish-Cuban bandleader Xavier Cugat and Peruvian exotica singer Yma Súmac are also referenced in the lyrics.

==Music video==
The video was directed by Jean-Sébastien Deligny in 1988, and begins by glimpsing the side of Joe's taxi (taxi rates can be seen in black ink). The shadows of two men playing the saxophone in unison can also be seen. The video then shows Joe in his taxi and afterward, a young Vanessa Paradis gyrating her body to the beat of the song, next to a big yellow taxi similar to Joe's (she is wearing an oversized peach sweater with the words "Gross Stage" and the number twenty-six emblazoned across the front; she is also wearing grey pants.

Joe seems to be driving around town, either looking out for customers or simply enjoying a scenic journey across a bright and beautiful Paris.	

The camera switches between Joe, Vanessa, and the two shadows playing their saxophones in perfect unison (in colour when focussed on Paradis, in black-and-white when on Joe); it ends with a front view of Joe's taxi.

'''Joe le taxi''' est le premier tube de Vanessa Paradis, qui n'avait que 14 ans lors de sa sortie le 27 avril 1987, écrit par Étienne Roda-Gil pour les paroles et Franck Langolff pour la musique.

La chanson parle d'un conducteur de taxi probablement parisien (on y parle de la Seine et de ses ponts, et d'embouteillages), Joe, qui écoute du mambo (Xavier Cugat, Yma Sumac).
