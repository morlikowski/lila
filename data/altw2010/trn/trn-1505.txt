thumb|300px'''Black Mesa Source''' (BMS) — это глобальная модификация для Half-Life, позволяющая пройти игру Half-Life на движке Source. В ней переработаны все модели и текстуры с первой части, а также отработаны сами уровни. Разработчики модификации заявили, что собираются сделать полностью синхронную сюжетную линию, лишь несколько изменив её, но не нарушая баланса. Модификация победила конкурс [http://www.moddb.com/events/2007-mod-of-the-year-awards/ «2007 Mod Of The Year Award Event»]в номинации Best Upcoming Mods & Indie Games of 2007, призовые деньги отправились на содержание проекта.<ref>http://www.blackmesasource.com/</ref>. На данный момент модификация ещё не выпущена, но на сторонних сайтах можно скачать её альфа-версию, в которой ещё много недоработок.

'''''Black Mesa''''' (previously known as '''''Black Mesa: Source''''') is a third-party total conversion mod for ''Half-Life'' from the ground up, using the advanced capabilities of the character AI, to create a new and more engrossing in-game world by introducing more varied, complex environments and more challenging, realistic gameplay. ''Black Mesa'' will be playable by anyone with copies of both ''Half-Life 2'' and ''Counter-Strike: Source''. Though they have since moved to episode two's engine for more up-to-date graphics.

== Overview ==

''Black Mesa'', which began in November 2004, was born of the discontent fans experienced when playing ''port, except for improved water and lighting effects. According to the developers, 

''Black Mesa'' won the Mod DB "Golden Spanner Award" for the most anticipated ''Half-Life 2'' mod of 2005. Most likely due to the amount of publicity given to an unofficial third-party mod, Valve Corporation privately asked the producers of the mod to remove the "Source" part from the title to avoid confusion on whether it is an official Valve product or not. 

Some of the chapters are nearing completion and they have released images of skins for the science personnel, and for some Xen aliens. It is also currently planned to include co-op gameplay, something only the PlayStation2 version of Half-Life offered.<ref>{{cite web
