'''Salyut 1 (DOS-1)''' (; English translation: ''Salute 1'') was the first space station of any kind, and the first Soviet space station.  It was launched on April 19, 1971. Its first crew launched in Soyuz 10 but was unable to board it due to a failure in the docking mechanism; its second crew launched in Soyuz 11 and remained on board for 23 productive days. However, a pressure-equalization valve in the Soyuz 11 reentry capsule opened prematurely when the crew returned to Earth, killing all three. Salyut 1 re-entered Earth's atmosphere on October 11, 1971.

==Structure==
At launch, the announced purpose of Salyut was to test the elements of the systems of a space station and to conduct scientific research and experiments. The craft was described as being 20 m in length, 4 m in maximum diameter, and 99 m³ in interior space with an on-orbit dry mass of 18,425 kg. Of its several compartments, three were pressurized (100 m³ total), and two could be entered by the crew.

===Transfer compartment===
The first, or transfer, compartment was connected directly with Soyuz 11. Its docking cone had a 2 m front end diameter and a 3 m aft end diameter.

===Main compartment===
The second, and main, compartment was about 4 m in diameter. Televised views showed enough space for eight big chairs (seven at work consoles), several control panels, and 20 portholes (some unobstructed by instruments).

===Auxiliary compartment===
The third pressurized compartment contained the control and communications equipment, the power supply, the buffer chemical batteries, reserve supplies of oxygen and water, and regeneration systems. Externally mounted were two double sets of solar cell panels that extended like wings from the smaller compartments at each end, the heat regulation system's radiators, and orientation and control devices.

Salyut 1 was modified from one of the Almaz airframes. The unpressurized service module was the modified service module of a Soyuz craft.

=== Orion 1 Space Observatory ===
The astrophysical Ultraviolet spectrograms of stars were obtained with the help of a mirror telescope of the Mersenne system and a Å/mm (3.2 nm/mm), while the resolution of the spectrograms derived was about 5 Å at 2600 Å (0.5 nm at 260 nm). Slitless spectrograms were obtained of the stars ''Vega'' and ''Beta Centauri'' between 2000 and 3800 Å (200 and 380 nm). The telescope was operated by crew member Viktor Patsayev, who became the first man to operate a telescope outside the Earth’s atmosphere.

==Specifications==
*Length - 15.8 m
*Maximum diameter - 4.15 m
*Habitable volume - 90 m³
*Mass at launch - 18,900 kg
*Launch vehicle - Proton (three-stage)
