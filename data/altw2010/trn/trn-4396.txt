'''''Dynasty Warriors 3''''' (真・三國無双2 (''Shin Sangokumusou 2'') in Japan)<ref name="JapName"></ref> is a Hack and slash video game developed by Omega Force (ω-force) and published by Koei. It is third in the ''Dynasty Warriors'' series in North America and the second in the ''Shin Sangokumusou'' series in Japan. It is a spin-off from the video game ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' and based around a series of books by the same name, written by Luo Guanzhong.<ref name='Joystiq'></ref> It contains a number of fictional and non-fictional elements from the same era in Chinese history that ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is set but follows the main events of part of the story which is to unify China under the single rule of a kingdom.

''Dynasty Warriors 3'' was the first in the series to introduce a two player mode and numerous other improvements over ''Dynasty Warriors 2''. New stages, characters, weapons, attacks and music are introduced providing a completely new experience to a player that has played ''Dynasty Warriors 2'' before. The gameplay engine and the graphics engine have also been updated, providing higher quality environments, textures and general overall graphics. Only one expansion was released for the game, ''Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends'' and it was the first in the ''Xtreme Legends'' series.

==Gameplay==
In ''Dynasty Warriors 3'' the player takes control of an officer and must attempt to defeat the enemy commander. The player must make their way through the stage defeating soldiers and enemy officers while trying to keep their commander alive. As well as hundreds of soldiers in each stage, there are stage specific events to complete that can help the player’s army and raise their morale. A higher morale means allied soldiers will attack more frequently and will be more likely to follow through with their combination attacks. To make this possible, officers and commanders have superhuman abilities and have the capability to kill hundreds of enemy soldiers per stage.<ref name="KoeiInfo"></ref>

The main play mode of the game is Musou mode, the story mode of the ''Dynasty Warriors'' series. Each playable character has their own Musou mode which consists of a number of stages that resemble events in ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms''. The Musou mode for each character is a linear story where the user cannot change the how the story progresses. The story progression for Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Jian and officers from their respective kingdoms have the closest relation to the ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' story but as the unaligned officers all died in RoTK, their Musou mode is complete fiction.

Initially there are 9 available characters to play as and new characters can be unlocked by performing special events during battle or simply meeting them during battle. Each playable character has their own unique weapon that can be upgraded and allows for a maximum of 4 levels of weapon.<ref name="FourthWeapons"></ref> When the next level of weapon is obtained, its strength is greater than the level below it and adds one extra attack to the player’s maximum number of attacks.

Items are also hidden throughout stages and can also be obtained by defeating officers. There are three types of items in game, normal items, red items and weapons which can be equipped before the stage begins and will increase the player’s statistics. Red items are specialised items than cause a special effect, such as starting the stage mounted on a horse or giving the player the ability to shoot fire arrows.<ref name="RedItems"></ref>

''Dynasty Warriors 3'' has an RPG element to it where the player can increase the strength, defence, life bar or Musou bar of the characters.<ref name="IGNReview"></ref> This can be achieved by defeating enemy officers and gate captains who will drop items that will increase the aforementioned statistics. Although it is not necessary to collect these items, it is helpful to the player as in later stages as enemies grow in strength.

The two player mode (new to ''Dynasty Warriors 3'') allows players to either go head-to-head in one-on-one fights or play co-operatively in any of the stages. The screen is split horizontally with player one on top and the second below. In one-on-one fights the characters statistics are reduced to their default to allow for a fair battle, relying more on the player’s skill rather than who has the stronger character. In co-operative play the characters retain their saved statistics, there are no alterations to the stage and the players gain the ability to perform a more powerful version of their Musou attack (''Special Attack''). If the players perform their Musou attack at the same time within range of each other, the attack gains a lightning element and deals extra damage to enemies that are hit.<ref>''When player 1 and player 2 are within a fixed distance from one another, and both perform Musou Attack, it becomes a Double Musou Attack'' (Dynasty Warriors 3 Game Manual, Musou Attacks)</ref>

==Plot==
===Setting===
''Dynasty Warriors 3'' is set across Ancient China<ref name="TripleJ"></ref> in the time of the Three Kingdoms era. The game begins at the fall of the Han Dynasty shortly after the death of the Emperor Ling <ref name="EmperorLing"></ref> when the leader of the Way of Peace, Zhang Jiao,<ref>''Zhang Jiao – Founder of the religious sect known as the Way of Peace. Declaring himself the “General of Heaven,” he led the Yellow Turban Rebellion.'' (Dynasty Warriors 3 Game Manual, Characters, Other Heroes)</ref> led an uprising against the Empire.

The game features a strong mix of fact and fiction from Chinese History and often exaggerates characters and their personalities. Most of the events and stages<ref name="DWStages"></ref> are reported to have occurred in the Three Kingdoms era during the struggle of power. The three kingdoms primarily involved, Shu, Wu and Wei, each sought power enough to overthrow the other two and unify China under their rule. Although the story in ''Dynasty Warriors'' is not perfect in the sense that it does not accurately follow the historical events, it has been changed to make the game more playable and less repetitive. For example, a number of the characters in the game died in the time frame that the game is set but they still appear in later stages. The game features environments resembling that of Ancient China and various items from the era such as Fairy Wine and Dim Sums.

It also touches on Mysticism as some characters (Zhuge Liang, Sima Yi, Pang Tong) have either magical elements in their attacks or completely magical attacks.
