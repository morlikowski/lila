== Historie ==

Det offisielle namnet på byen er ei samantrekking av det nederlandske ''des Hertogen bosch'' - «skogen til hertugen». Hertugen det er snakk om var Aa vart nytta. 

Fram til 1520 blømde byen og var den nest største byen i dagens Nederland etter Utrecht. Han vart òg eit kultursenter og renessansemålaren Hieronymus Bosch var mellom anna fødd her. I tillegg fekk mange komponistar, som Jheronimus Clibano, opplæring i domkyrkja her.

Kalvinistane prøvde seg på eit kupp, men vart hindra. Byen vart fleire gonger omleira av fyrst Maurice av Orange, statthaldar av Holland, for Dei sameinte Nederlanda. På grunn av dei omliggande myrområda viste det seg særs vanskeleg å ta byen, men han vart til slutt erobra av Frederik Hendrik av Orange i 1629 då han nytta vindmøller til å pumpe bort vatnet rundt byen. Etter ei tre månader lang omleiring måtte byen så overgje seg. I 1672 klarte byen å stå i mot hæren til Ludvig XIV av Frankrike. I 1794 gjekk franskmennene til åtak på byen igjen og tok han til slutt etter harde kampar. Byen vart så ein del av Den bataviske republikken. 

Frå 1806 vart byen ein del av Frankrike og vart erobra av Preussen i 1814. Året etter vart Det sameinte kongedømet Nederland oppretta og han vart hovudstad i provinsen Noord-Brabant. Byen var overfylt med innbyggjarar på 1800-talet og på grunn av konservative styresmakter i byen, som ikkje ønska at enno fleire skulle flytte hit, gjekk den industrielle utviklinga tregt. Derfor vart byen etter kvart mindre viktig.

Etter den andre verdskrigen vart det lagt fram planar om å modernisere byen, fylle att kanalane og vollgravene og rekonstruere historiske nabolag. Før planane vart sett i verk erklærte styresmaktene byen for eit verna byområde, og dei fleste historiske elementa er derfor bevart i dag.

''''s-Hertogenbosch''' () (literally "The Duke's Forest"), colloquially known as '''Den Bosch''' () (literally "The Bosh") — translated in French as ''Bois-le-Duc'', in German as ''Herzogenbusch'', in Spanish as ''Bolduque'' and in Italian as ''Boscoducale'' — is a municipality in the Netherlands, and also the capital of the province of North Brabant. It is located in the south of the Netherlands, some 80 km south of Amsterdam.

== The city of 's-Hertogenbosch ==
=== History ===
The city's official name is a contraction of the Dutch ''des Hertogen bosch'' - "the Duke's forest". The duke in question was city rights and the corresponding trade privileges in 1185. This is however the traditional date given by later chroniclers; the first mention in contemporaneous sources is in 1196. The original Aa were diverted.

Until 1520, the city flourished: it then was the second largest population centre at the territory of the present Netherlands, after Utrecht. It was also the birthplace and home of one of the greatest painters of the northern renaissance, Hieronymus Bosch (c. 1450–1516). The city was also a center of music, with many composers, such as Jheronimus Clibano, receiving their training at the cathedrals there.  Others held positions there:  Matthaeus Pipelare was musical director at the Confraternity of Our Lady, and renowned Habsburg copyist and composer Pierre Alamire did much of his work at 's-Hertogenbosch.

The wars of the Maurice of Orange, United Provinces. Afterwards the fortifications were greatly expanded. As the surrounding marshes made a siege of the conventional type impossible, the fortress was deemed impregnable and nicknamed the Marsh Dragon. The town was nevertheless finally conquered by dyke and then pumped out the water by mills. After a siege of three months, the city had to surrender, an enormous blow to Habsburg strategy during the Louis XIV. In 1794, French revolutionary troops under command of Charles Pichegru took the city with hardly a fight: in the Batavian Republic both Catholics and ''Brabanders'' at last gained equal rights.

From 1806, the city was part of France. It was captured by the Prussians in 1814. The next year, when the United Kingdom of the Netherlands was established, it became the capital of North Brabant. Many new more modern fortresses were created in the vicinity of the city. Until 1878 it was forbidden to build outside the ramparts. This led to overcrowding and the highest infant mortality in the kingdom. The very conservative city government prevented industrial investment — they didn't want a growth in the number of workers — and even the establishment of educational institutions — even students being too disorderly. Therefore the relative importance of the city diminished. In World War II it was liberated from 24 to 27 October 1944 by the 53rd (Welsh) Division. After the war, plans were made to modernise the old city, by filling in the canals, slighting some ramparts and reconstructing historic neighbourhoods. Before these plans could come to effect however, the central government declared the city a protected townscape. Most historic elements have thereby been preserved.

=== Places of interest ===
's-Hertogenbosch was founded as a fortified city and that heritage can still be seen today. Because the main ramparts are crucial in keeping out the water, they have never been slighted, their usual fate in The Netherlands. In contrast to cities like Second World War relatively unscathed. Much of its historic heritage remains intact, and today there are always renovations going on in the city to preserve the many old buildings, fortifications, churches and statues for later generations. In 2004 the city was awarded the title ''European Fortress City of the year''. It is planned to restore the city defences to much of their old glory in the coming years. 's-Hertogenbosch also has the oldest remaining brick house in The Netherlands, 'de Moriaan', which was built at the beginning of the 13th century. In the north of the old city, the hexagonal powder arsenal, or ''Kruithuis'', still exists, one of only two of its kind in the country. The Townhall is a 17th century building, erected in the typical style of Dutch classicism. Around the city itself many other fortresses can still be seen. Until recently it was a major garrison town.

The old city of 's-Hertogenbosch is still almost completely surrounded by continuous ramparts. On the south side, this wall still borders on an old polder, kept intact as a nature reserve, that stretches all the way to Vught. These city walls are currently undergoing renovations. Hidden below the old city is a canal network called the Binnendieze that once spanned 22 kilometres. It started out as a regular river, the Dommel, running through the city in medieval times but due to lack of space in the city, people started building their houses and roads over the river. In later times it functioned as a sewer and fell into disrepair. In recent decades, the remaining sixth of the old waterway system has been renovated, and it is possible to take several guided subterranean boat trips through it.

's-Hertogenbosch is also home to Saint John's Cathedral (''Sint Jans kathedraal'' in Dutch) which is said to be one of the most beautiful cathedrals in The Netherlands. The Cathedral dates from ''circa'' 1220 and is best known for its (Brabantian) gothic design and the many sculptures of craftsmen that are sitting on almost every arc and rim along the outside of the cathedral. At the time of writing, the cathedral is being extensively renovated to undo the damage of many years of wear-and-tear and acid rain.

The painter Hieronymus Bosch (c. 1450 - 1516) probably remains the best known citizen of 's-Hertogenbosch.

=== Contemporary 's-Hertogenbosch ===
The city of 's-Hertogenbosch has become a centre of industry, education, administration and culture. It is currently the fourth city of International Vocal Competition and the Ordina Open grass court tennis tournament (in the nearby town of Rosmalen). There are also over 350 restaurants, pubs and cafés to be found in the city.
