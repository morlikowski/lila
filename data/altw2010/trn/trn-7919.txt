'''H&#250; Y&#224;ob&#257;ng''' (kinesisk: 胡耀邦) (20. november 1915 i Linyang i provinsen  Hunan i Kina - 15. april 1989 i provinsen Jiangxi) var en kinesisk politiker, hvis død i foråret 1989 udløste en række begivenheder, som mundede ud i Demonstrationerne på Den Himmelske Freds Plads nogle måneder efter.  

Han var generalsekretær for Det kinesiske kommunistparti fra 1980 til 1987 og partiets formand fra 1981 til 1982.
Hu Yaobang tilhørte anden generation af de kinesiske kommunistledere i Folkerepublikken Kina og var et aktivt medlem af reformfraktionen i 1980'erne.  Hu var længe Deng Xiaopings ønskekandidat som  potentiel efterfølger. Han tabte imidlertid i 1987 politisk troværdighed i ledende partikræfter, fordi mere dogmatisk orienterede politikere mente, at han havde optrådt for eftergivende under studenterdemonstrationerne i 1986-1987. Han tilbagetræden fra posten som generalsekretær annonceredes 16. januar 1987 og fulgtes af en ydmygende ''selvkritik'', som centralkomitéen tvang ham til at udgive.

Han døde i 1989 af et hjerteanfald under et møde i det kinesiske politbureau.

'''Hu Yaobang''' (Chinese: 胡耀邦 Pinyin: Hú Yàobāng, Wade-Giles: Hu Yao-pang; November 20, 1915&ndash;April 15, 1989) was a leader of the People's Republic of China. A prominent reformer, his death in 1989 triggered a series of events which eventually led to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

==Early years==
Hu Yaobang joined the communist revolution at an early age as a young teenager and as a supporter of Mao Zedong. He was persecuted many times by the communist cadres of the faction returning from the former-Soviet Union, who controlled the communist leadership and had the real power.  Once Mao Zedong was removed from power for good shortly before the beginning of the Fourth Encirclement Campaign, his supporters were persecuted once again, and Hu Yaobang was sentenced to death. Just before the beginning of the Long March, he and others were on their way to be beheaded.  However, a powerful local communist commander named Tan Yubao (谭余保, 1899 - January 10, 1980) intervened at the last minute, saving Hu's life, but because of Hu's support of Mao, he was deemed as unreliable and ordered to join the Long March so that he could be placed under surveillance.
Despite distrust from top leadership, Hu remained loyal to the communist cause and attempted to prove himself at every opportunity when fighting their nationalist (KMT) enemy.  Hu Yaobang was seriously wounded at the Campaign of Xiang River, where the Chinese Red Army was disastrously defeated.  However, the communist field medic teams chose not to help Hu and left him in the battlefield to die on the side of the road. Luck was on Hu's side when a childhood friend of his, a Chinese Red Army commander, happened to pass by. Hu called out his friend's nickname to ask for help, and the friend helped him to catch up with the retreating main force of the Chinese Red Army and get treatment for his wounds.

Hu Yaobang's luck seemed to have run out after the Japanese invaders, Ma Bufang decided that instead of using his own troops, he would instead send the 1,500 Chinese Red Army prisoners-of-war as conscripts.  Since the marching route had to pass the border of the communist base in Shaanxi, Hu Yaobang and Qin Jiwei seized this opportunity to return to the communists and organize a planned escape in secrecy.  The escape took place as planned and was a success: out of the total 1,500, more than 1,300 had successfully returned to Yan'an.  Mao Zedong personally welcomed these returning communists and Hu Yaobang was once again back in the communist camp, where he would remain for rest of his life. However, the political persecution continued, and from the very communist leader Hu Yaobang once firmly supported.

==Reformer==
As Deng Xiaoping gradually regained control over the CPC, Deng's rival Hua Guofeng was replaced by Zhao Ziyang as Premier of the State Council in 1980, and by Hu Yaobang as Party Chairman in 1981. Hu was also made General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 1980 but, until the mid-1990s, it was Deng who was calling the shots although his only  official title was that of chairman of the Communist Party's Central Military Commission. 

During his time in office, Hu tried to rehabilitate the people who were persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. Many Chinese people think that this was his most important achievement. He was also in favor of a pragmatic policy in Tibet, ordering the withdrawal of thousands of Chinese Han cadres from the Tibet Autonomous Region following a 1980 visit to the region, believing that Tibetans should be empowered to administer their own affairs.

Although Hu was a dedicated reformer and one of Deng Xiaoping's most important associates, he was later forced to resign in 1987 from his post as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China; leaving officially on January 16. Deng forced Hu to resign on the heels of a series of student demonstrations in late 1986, believed by the hardliners as a consequence of Hu's tolerance of and perhaps his empathetic attitude towards China's liberal intelligentsia, who were pushing for more political freedom and reform. He was also accused of "making mistakes in Sino-Japanese relations".

==Death and the Tiananmen protests==

Hu Yaobang died due to a heart attack two years later at a Party Political Bureau meeting on CPC to accord him a State Funeral attended by party leaders, and a eulogy which praised his work in restoring political norm and promoting economic development after the Cultural Revolution.

However, many people were dissatisfied with the party's slow response and relatively subdued funerary arrangements. Public mourning began on the streets of Beijing and elsewhere. In Beijing this was centred on the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square. The mourning became a public conduit for anger against perceived nepotism in the government, the unfair dismissal and early death of Hu, and the behind-the-scenes role of the "old men", officially retired leaders who nevertheless maintained quasi-legal power, such as Deng Xiaoping. Protests eventually escalated into the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Hu's ideas of freedom of speech and freedom of press in 1986 greatly influenced the students participating in the protests.

After Hu's funeral, his body was cremated. There are reports that initially his widow wanted his ashes to be buried in his home town of Liuyang. However, the local leaders hesitated to accept such a controversial bequest, and he was eventually buried at Gongqing Cheng (literally "Communist Youth City").
