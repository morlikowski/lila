'''Joachim "PimPim" Johansson''' (born July 1 1982) is a former professional male tennis player from Sweden.

==Background==
Johansson was born in Leif Johansson, was also a tennis player and represented Sweden in the Davis Cup in the 1970s. He goes by the nickname "Pim Pim," which is a popular Swedish candy. In 2005, Swedish hurdler Jenny Kallur became his girlfriend.<ref>[http://www.itftennis.com/mens/players/player.asp?player=30017595 ITF Profile]</ref> He dated Lleyton Hewitt's sister, Jaslyn, for four years from 2000 to 2004.<ref></ref>

==Tennis career==
Johansson won his first ATP singles title in 2004 when he overcame Memphis final. In 2005 he won another two titles (Adelaide and Marseille).

He caused a huge upset at the 2004 U.S. Open when he defeated defending champion Andy Roddick in five sets in the quarterfinals. An unusual aspect of the match was that Roddick won 24 points more than Johansson but was defeated nonetheless. Johansson subsequently lost his semifinal against Lleyton Hewitt.

Johansson underwent shoulder surgery in July 2005, forcing him to stop playing the rest of the year.  In 2006 he added physical rehabilitation and development practice with coach Susanna and Jenny Kallur.  In February 2006, he played in the SAP Open in San Jose but sustained another injury. He was then forced to skip tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami until beginning a second comeback in July 2006 by playing Challenger and Futures tournaments.

In October 2006, Johansson made a triumphant return to the ATP Tour in the Stockholm Open. As a wildcard, he defeated Davide Sanguinetti in the first round, and stunned top seed and world number two Rafael Nadal in straight sets in the second round. In that match, Johansson fired 17 aces, and announced his return to the top of the game, calling it his "greatest win ever."  Johansson made it to the semifinals of the tournament before losing to fifth-seeded Jarkko Nieminen in three sets.
In his next tournament, the Madrid Masters, Johansson pulled off another upset in the second round, defeating fifth-seeded Nikolay Davydenko in three sets.  He was forced, however, to withdraw from his next match due to a throat infection.

Johansson retired from professional tennis on February 1 2008 due to his persistent shoulder injury.<ref></ref> Johansson said there was "no other option" than to quit.<ref></ref>
