'''Alessandria''' ('''Lissandria''' in Piedmontese) is a city in Tanaro, c. 90&nbsp;km southeast of Turin. 

Alessandria is also a major railway hub.

==History==
Alessandria was founded in 1168 upon a preexisting urban nucleus, to serve as a stronghold for the communes of northern Italy against the Imperial forces of Frederick Barbarossa.
Alessandria stood in the territories of the marchese of Herculanus’ successful defense of Perugia several centuries earlier) says it was saved by a quick-witted peasant, Gagliaudo: he fed his cow with the last grain remaining within the city, then took it outside the city walls until he reached the Imperial camp. Here he was captured, and his cow cut open to be cooked: when the Imperials found the cow's stomach filled with grain, Gagliaudo was asked the reason to waste such a rich meal. He answered that he was forced to feed his cow with grain because there was such a lot of it, and no room to place it within the city. The Emperor, fearing that the siege would last too long, left Alessandria free. (Malaria was probably the real cause of his departure.) A statue of Gagliaudo can be found on the left corner of the city cathedral. Alessandria was granted a charter as a free commune in 1198, but entered into jealous conflicts with the older communes of the region, in particular with Asti.

In 1348 Alessandria fell into the hands of the Visconti and passed with their possessions to the Sforza, following the career of Milan, until 1707, when it was ceded to the House of Savoy and henceforth formed part of Piedmont.

With Napoleon's success at the Département of Marengo. During this period a substantial fort was built to the north of the city containing impressive and substantial barracks which are still used as a military HQ and stores (2006). The remains of a second fort to the south of the city (Christo quarter) have been sliced in two by a railway.

From 1814 Alessandria was Savoyard territory once more, part of the Kingdom of Sardinia.

During the years of the Risorgimento, Alessandria was an active center of the liberals.

In a suburb, Spinetta Marengo, the Battle of Marengo is reenacted annually, on June 14.

Alessandria was the first capital of an Italian province to be governed by a Socialist: the clockmaker Paolo Sacco was elected ''sindaco''. July 25, 1899.

Alessandria was a tactical military target during Brazilian Expeditionary Force

On November 6, 1994 the Tanaro flooded a good part of the city, causing major damage, especially in the Orti quarter.
