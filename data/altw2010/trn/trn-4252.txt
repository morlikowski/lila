El '''zircó''' és un ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>. Gairebé sempre conté entre un 1 i un 4% d'hafni. L'estructura de cristal·lització del zircó és tetragonal. El color natural del zircó varia entre groc-daurat, vermell, marró, verd o incolor. Els exemplars incolors que presenten qualitat de gemma són un substitut popular del diamant.

'''Zircon''' is a nesosilicates. Its chemical name is ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>. Hafnium is almost always present in quantities ranging from 1 to 4%. The crystal structure of zircon is tetragonal crystal class. The natural color of zircon varies between colorless, yellow-golden, red, brown, and green. Colorless specimens that show gem quality are a popular substitute for diamond; these specimens are also known as "Matura diamond". It is not to be confused with cubic zirconia, a synthetic substance with a completely different chemical composition.

The name either derives from the Arabic word ''zarqun'', meaning Persian ''zargun'', meaning golden-colored. These words are corrupted into "jargoon", a term applied to light-colored zircons. Yellow zircon is called '''hyacinth''', from a word of East Indian origin; in the Middle Ages all yellow stones of East Indian origin were called hyacinth, but today this term is restricted to the yellow zircons.

Zircon is regarded as the traditional birthstone for December.

Zircon is a remarkable mineral, if only for its almost ubiquitous presence in the crust of Earth. It is found in granite rocks, is about 100&ndash;300 µm, but they can also grow to sizes of several centimeters, especially in pegmatites.

Owing to their uranium and thorium content, some zircons may undergo metamictization. This partially disrupts the crystal structure and explains the highly variable properties of zircon.

Zircon is a common accessory mineral and found worldwide. Noted occurrences include: in the Ural Mountains; Trentino, Monte Somma; and Vesuvius, Italy; Arendal, Norway; Sri Lanka, India; Thailand; Ratanakiri, Cambodia; at the Kimberley mines, Republic of South Africa; Madagascar; and in Canada in Renfrew County, Ontario, and Grenville, Quebec.  In the United States: Litchfield, Maine; Chesterfield, Massachusetts; in Essex, Orange, and St. Lawrence Counties, New York; Henderson County, North Carolina; the Pikes Peak district of Colorado; and Llano County, Texas. 

Thorite (ThSiO<sub>4</sub>) is an isostructural related mineral.

Zircon can come in red, brown, yellow, hazel, black, or colorless. The color of zircons below gem quality can be changed by heat treatment. Depending on the amount of heat applied, colorless, blue, and golden-yellow zircons can be made.

Zircons are commercially mined for the metal zirconium, and are used for abrasive and insulating purposes. It is the source of zirconium oxide, one of the most refractory materials known. Crucibles of ZrO are used to fuse platinum at temperatures in excess of 1755 <sup>o</sup>C. Zirconium metal is used in nuclear reactors due to its neutron absorption properties. Large specimens are appreciated as gemstones, owing to their high refractive index (zircon has a refractive index of around 1.95, diamond around 2.4).
