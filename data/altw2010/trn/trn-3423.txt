Een '''paperclip''' is een meervoudig gebogen metalen draadje waarmee enkele velletjes verchroomd maar ook wel geplastificeerd in allerlei kleuren. Naast de metalen uitvoering is ook de kunststof variant in opkomst.

De eerste paperclip was de ''Fay Paperclip'' en werd in gepatenteerd. Deze clip bestond uit een in een driehoek gebogen metalen draadje, waarbij de uiteinden aan de punt van de driehoek nog wat doorlopen. Sinds die tijd zijn er bijzonder veel paperclips gepatenteerd. Om er enkele te noemen: De ''Wright Paperclip'' (1877), de ''Reeve Paper Clip'' (1897). De paperclip zoals wij die kennen is de ''Gem Paper Clip'' en is waarschijnlijk nooit gepatenteerd. Wel is Gem in combinatie met de paperclip als handelsmerk gedeponeerd. De Gem is door Cushman & Denison op de markt gebracht. 

Een andere paperclip is de ''Vaaler Paperclip''. Deze was een driehoek, waarbij de uiteinden parallel liepen langs de Noor Haakon VII door de Duitsers werden verboden. Om Vaaler te eren werd er in Oslo een enorme paperclip gemaakt van meer dan 6 meter hoog en een gewicht van ruim 600 kg.

Als onderdeel van hun studie over de massamoord op de joden in de tweede wereldoorlog probeerden leerlingen van de Middelbare School Whitwell in Tennessee in de Verenigde Staten 6 miljoen paperclips te verzamelen die symbool staan voor de 6 miljoen vermoorde joden. Over de hele wereld kwamen spontane reacties met als gevolg dat een oorspronkelijke wagon, waarmee joden naar de concentratiekampen werden vervoerd, verscheept werd naar Whitwell en werd gevuld met 11 miljoen paperclips ter nagedachtenis aan 6 miljoen vermoorde joden en 5 miljoen vermoorde roma's en homoseksuelen. Een weergave van deze actie is te zien in de film "Paper clips", die op het Palm Springs International Film Festival de hoogste prijs in de wacht sleepte en in de top five documentaries van 2004 van the National Board of Review werd opgenomen. 

Het oorspronkelijke ontwerp (de Fay paperclip) bevatte slechts twee bochten. Het nadeel daarvan was dat het papier bij het loshalen wel eens beschadigde. Modernere uitvoeringen beschikken over één bocht meer, verder is er niets aan het ontwerp veranderd. De metalen uitvoeringen worden tegenwoordig soms van een plastic coating voorzien, vaak in veel verschillende kleuren. Het meestgebruikte formaat paperclip heeft uitgevouwen een lengte van 10 cm.

Omdat de paperclip relatief eenvoudig te verbuigen is, wordt hij vaak gebruikt voor doeleinden waarvoor de paperclip nooit ontworpen is: reset-knopjes van kleine apparaten indrukken en het afreageren van Brits onderzoek uit de jaren zeventig is gebleken dat van de 100.000 paperclips maar 20.000 paperclips gebruikt werden om papier bij elkaar te houden. 24.838 paperclips raakten zoek, 19.143 dienden als nagels schoon te houden en met 3.916 stuks werden pijpen schoongemaakt.

A '''paper clip''' (or sometimes '''paperclip''') is a device which holds several sheets of staple, which will damage the paper unless removed carefully, and will always leave two holes in the paper.

==Shape and composition==
It is usually a thin wire in a looped shape that takes advantage of the elasticity and strength of the materials of its construction (usually torsion and friction.  Some other kinds of clips use a 2 piece clamp system.

==History==
The first patent for the paper clip was awarded to Samuel B. Fay of the United States in 1867.<ref>[http://www.earlyofficemuseum.com/paper_clips.htm History of the Paper Clip], Early Office Museum.</ref> It was designed to fasten labels to garments and textiles, but was also marketed as a paper clip. In 1877 Erlman J. Wright patented the first device explicitly designed as a paper clip, resembling present models. Several new U.S. patents followed during the last decades of the 19th century.

The most common type of Britain as early as 1890 by "The Gem Manufacturing Company". An advertisement for Gem clips in 1899 referred to a patent, but this has never been documented. The American expert on technological innovations, professor Henry J. Petroski, has seen the Gem mentioned as early as 1883, but this could refer to some other product from the same British factory.<ref>Petroski, Henry, "From Pins to Paper Clips", ''The Evolution of Useful Things'', Vintage, New York, 1992.</ref> The earliest known documentation of its existence is an advertisement for "Gem Paper Clips" published in August Swedish the word for any paper clip is "gem".

It has been claimed<ref>A series, episode 8 of ''QI''.</ref><ref>Father Gregory Tillett, [http://www.britishorthodox.org/104e.shtml review of ''The Pharaoh's Shadow: Travels in Ancient and Modern Egypt'' by Anthony Sattin], ''The Glastonbury Review'', Edition 104.</ref><ref>G. W. Trompf, [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0007-1005(196910)17%3A3%3C267%3ARCIHSE%3E2.0.CO%3B2-T "Radical Conservatism in Herbert Spencer's Educational Thought"], ''British Journal of Educational Studies'', Vol. 17, No. 3 (Oct., 1969), pp. 267–280.</ref>, though apparently without evidence, that Herbert Spencer, the originator of the term "survival of the fittest", invented the paper clip.

Definite proof that the modern type of paper clip was well known in 1899 at the latest is the patent granted to Waterbury, Connecticut on April 27 of that year for a "Machine for making wire paper clips". The drawing clearly shows that the product is a perfect clip of the Gem type.<ref>Petroski, Henry, "Paper Clips and Design", ''Invention by Design'', Harvard University Press, 1996, p. 17.</ref> Since then countless variations on the same theme have been patented. Some have pointed instead of rounded ends, some have the end of one loop bent slightly to make it easier to insert sheets of paper, and some have wires with undulations or barbs to get a better grip. In addition, purely aesthetic variants have been patented, clips with triangular or round shapes.<ref>Petroski, Henry, "Polishing the Gem: A First-Year Design Project". Appendix: A selected list of U.S. Patents for paper clips. ''Journal of Engineering Education'', 1998, p. 449.</ref> But the original Gem type has for more than a hundred years proved to be the most practical, and consequently by far the most popular. Its qualities of easy use, gripping without tearing, and storing without tangling have been difficult to improve on.

Recent innovations include multi-colored plastic-coated paper clips and spring-fastened binder clips.

==Norwegian claim==

A Norwegian, Johan Vaaler (1866–1910), has erroneously been identified as the inventor of the paper clip. He was granted patents in Germany<ref>Application dated 12 November 1899, Patentschrift no. 121067, patent granted 6 June 1901</ref> and in the United States<ref>US Patent No. 675,761 June 4, 1901</ref> (1901) for a paper clip of similar design, but less functional and practical, because it lacked the last turn of the wire. Vaaler probably did not know that a better product was already on the market, although not yet in Norway. His version was never manufactured and never marketed because the superior "Gem" was already available. 

Long after Vaaler's death his countrymen created a national myth based on the false assumption that the paper clip was invented by an unrecognised Norwegian genius.  Norwegian dictionaries since the 1950s have mentioned Vaaler as the inventor of the paper clip,<ref>"Binders" ''Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon'', Oslo 1974, vol. 2, p. 695.</ref> and that myth later found its way into international dictionaries and much of the international literature on paper clips.

Vaaler probably succeeded in having his design patented abroad, despite the previous existence of a better product, because patent authorities at that time were quite liberal and rewarded any marginal modification of existing inventions.<ref>Petroski, Henry "The Evolution of Artifacts", ''American Scientist'', Volume 80, 1992, p. 416–20.</ref>  As the employee of a patent office, he could easily have obtained a patent in Norway.<ref>Johan Vaaler began working for ''Bryns Patentkontor'' in Kristiania in 1892 and was later promoted to office manager, a position he held until his death.</ref> His reasons for applying abroad are not known, but it is possible that he had an exaggerated confidence in his own invention and wanted to secure the commercial rights internationally. Also, he may have been aware that Norwegian inventors would meet difficulties on the small home market.

Vaaler's patents expired quietly, while the "Gem" was used worldwide, including his own country. The failure of his design was obvious — it was too impractical. Without the two full loops of the fully developed paper clip, it was difficult to insert sheets of paper into his clip. One could manipulate the end of the inner wire so that it could receive the sheet, but the outer wire was a dead end because it could not exploit the torsion principle. The clip would instead stand out like a keel, perpendicular to the sheet of paper. The impracticality of Vaaler's design may easily be demonstrated by cutting off the last outer loop and one long side from a regular Gem clip.

==National symbol==

The originator of the Norwegian paper clip myth was an engineer of the national patent agency who visited Germany in the 1920s to register Norwegian patents in that country. He came across Vaaler's patent, but failed to detect that it was not the same as the then-common Gem-type clip.<ref>Vaaler's forgotten German patent was found by patent engineer ''Halvard Foss'' of The Norwegian Industrial Property Office (Patenstyret) while looking for patents granted to Norwegians in the German patent office. "I made this discovery known to my colleagues", Foss stated in an interview with the weekly ''A-magasinet'' no. 52, 1988</ref> In the report of the first fifty years of the patent agency, he wrote an article in which he proclaimed Vaaler to be the inventor of the common paper clip.<ref>Foss, Halvard: "Den frittstående oppfinner", ''Styret for det industrielle rettsvern 50 år'', Oslo 1961, p. 190</ref> This piece of information found its way into some Norwegian encyclopedias after World War II. 

Events of that war contributed greatly to the mythical status of the paper clip. Patriots wore them in their lapels as a symbol of resistance to the German occupiers and local Nazi authorities when other signs of resistance were forbidden, such as flag pins or pins showing the cipher of the exiled King Haakon VII of Norway. The clips were meant to denote solidarity and unity ("we are bound together"). The wearing of paper clips was soon prohibited, and people wearing them were severely punished.<ref>Bø, Finn: ''Forbuden frukt'' (First edition 1945), Oslo 1995, ISBN 82-509-3249-8</ref> The leading Norwegian encyclopedia mentioned the role of the paper clip as a symbol of resistance in a supplementary volume in 1952, but did not yet proclaim it a Norwegian invention.<ref>''Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon'', supplementsbind, Oslo 1952</ref> That information was added in later editions. According to the 1974 edition, the idea of using the paper clip to denote resistance originated in Resistance, General Charles de Gaulle.<ref>''Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon'', Oslo 1974, Vol. 2, p. 695.</ref>
