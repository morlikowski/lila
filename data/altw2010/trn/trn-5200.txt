Un '''composé organométallique''' est un composé chimique comportant au moins une liaison carbone-métal. Il est néanmoins courant que l'on désigne sous ce terme l'ensemble des composés combinant un métal et un composé organique. Les composés organométalliques sont désignés par le préfixe « organo- ».

Cette famille comprend principalement:

* les organomagnésiens mixtes, appelés aussi les « réactifs de Grignard », du nom de leur découvreur ;
* les organolithiens ;
* les organocuprates ;
* les organozinciques ;
* les organostannaness ;
* les organoboroniques ;
* les organosilanes ;
* les organoétains ;
* les organouraniens ;
* …

Les composés organométalliques sont, entre autre, utilisés comme catalyseurs dans les réactions chimiques. C'est par exemple le cas de certains dérivés du platine, du palladium, du ruthénium et d'autres métaux rares.

Une partie importante des composés organo-métalliques, sont donc les composés présentant une liaison carbone-métal. Parmi eux, on compte notamment les métallocènes (comme les ferrocènes) de formule 
(C<sub>5</sub>R<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>M Ces derniers sont par exemple utilisés dans certaines synthèses (méthodes CVD) des nanotubes de carbone.

'''Organometallic chemistry''' is the study of bonds between carbon and a metal.<ref name="crabtree"></ref><ref></ref> Since many compounds without such bonds are chemically similar, an alternative may be compounds containing metal-element bonds of a largely covalent character. Organometallic chemistry combines aspects of inorganic chemistry and organic chemistry.

== Organometallic compounds ==
Organometallic compounds are also known as organo-inorganics, metallo-organics and Gilman which contain lithium and copper. Tetracarbonyl nickel, and ferrocene are examples of organometallic compounds containing transition metals. Other examples include organomagnesium compounds like iodo(methyl)magnesium MeMgI, diethylmagnesium (Et<sub>2</sub>Mg), and all Grignard reagents; organolithium compounds such as butyllithium (BuLi), organozinc compounds such as chloro(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)zinc (ClZnCH<sub>2</sub>C(=O)OEt); and organocopper compounds such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Li<sup>+</sup>[CuMe<sub>2</sub>]<sup>–</sup>). 

In addition to the traditional metals and semimetals, elements such as boron, silicon, arsenic, and selenium are considered to form organometallic compounds, e.g. organoborane compounds such as triethylborane (Et<sub>3</sub>B).

===Coordination compounds with organic ligands===
Many complexes feature coordination bonds between a metal and organic ligands. The organic ligands often bind the metal through a heteroatom such as oxygen or nitrogen, in which case such compounds are considered coordination compounds.  However, if any of the ligands form a direct M-C bond, then complex is usually considered to be organometallic, e.g., [(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)Ru(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. Furthermore, many lipophilic compounds such as metal acetylacetonates and metal alkoxides are called "metalorganics."

Many organic coordination compounds occur naturally. For example, Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>), with a MTR enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from a nitrogen on N5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate to the sulfur of homocysteine to produce methionine.

===Structure and properties===
The status of compounds in which the canonical anion has a delocalized structure in which the negative charge is shared with an atom more electronegative than carbon, as in enolates, may vary with the nature of the anionic moiety, the metal ion, and possibly the medium; in the absence of direct structural evidence for a carbon–metal bond, such compounds are not considered to be organometallic.

Depending mostly on the nature of metallic ion and somewhat on the nature of the organic compound, the character of the bond may either be ionic or covalent. Organic compounds bonded to sodium or potassium are primarily ionic. Those bonded to lead, tin, mercury, etc. are considered to have covalent bonds, and those bonded to magnesium or lithium have bonds with intermediate properties.

Organometallic compounds with bonds that have characters in between ionic and covalent are very important in industry, as they are both relatively stable in solutions and relatively ionic to undergo reactions. Two important classes are organolithium and Grignard reagents. In certain organometallic compounds such as ferrocene or dibenzenechromium, the pi orbitals of the organic moiety ligate the metal.

==Applications==
Organometallics find practical uses as catalytically active compounds. Tetraethyl lead previously was combined with gasoline as an antiknock agent. Due to lead's toxicity it is no longer used, its replacements being other organometallic compounds such as ferrocene and methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT). The Monsanto process utilizes a rhodium-carbonyl complex to manufacture acetic acid from methanol and carbon monoxide industrially. Similarly, the Wacker process is used in the oxidation of Olefins.  The Ziegler-Natta catalyst is a titanium-based organometallic compound used in the production of polyethylene and other polymers.

Ryoji Noyori's chiral ruthenium-BINAP complex catalytically reduces beta-ketoesters to secondary alcohols in the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Another common industrial organometallic compound is the Grubbs catalyst, a carbenoid (an organometallic compound of a carbene and a metal).

Organometallic compounds of the reactive metals such as lithium or zinc are extremely basic and may also act as reductants. These superbases are used in organic syntheses. Butyllithium is an example, widely used in synthetic organic chemistry. They are air-sensitive, however, and their flammability severely limits their industrial use.

==Concepts==
Electron counting is key in understanding organometallic chemistry. The 18-electron rule is helpful in predicting the stabilities of organometallic compounds. Organometallic compounds which have 18 electrons (filled s, p, and penultimate d orbitals) are relatively stable. This suggests the compound is isolable, but it can result in the compound being inert.
