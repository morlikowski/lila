De '''Tibetanen''' zijn een volk in China die leven in het gebied van het voormalige Tibet, in de huidige Tibetaanse Autonome Regio en delen van Qinghai, Sichuan en Gansu. Er zijn naar schatting vijf tot zes miljoen Tibetanen. Men leeft op de hooggelegen woestijn, die wordt begrensd door ijskoude kale vlakten en het hoofste gebergte ter wereld: de Himalaya.

In cultureel opzicht is Tibet veel groter dan de Tibetaanse Autonome Regio in China. Dit 'Groot-Tibet' omvat Kasjmir in het noorden van Sherpa's in Nepal, de Drukpa's in Bhutan en de Ladakhi's in Noord-India. De complexiteit van het Tibetaanse cultuurgebied wordt nog vergroot door de tientallen dialecten van kleinere etnische groepen.

De grote natuurlijke barrières en het politieke isolement leidden ertoe dat de Tibetanen tot halverwege de 20<sup>ste</sup> eeuw nog een nagenoeg middeleeuws bestaan leidden. In het uitgestrekte noorden leidden de Tibetanen een nomadisch bestaan: ze woonden in zwarte tenten en hoedden vee, voornamelijk de jak. In de 7<sup>de</sup> eeuw werd vanuit China het boeddhisme geïntroduceerd, korte tijd later gevolgd door de komst van boeddhistische missionarissen uit India. De geestelijke en wereldlijke instituties raakten verweven, wat alle aspecten van het leven beïnvloedde.

Hoewel het Tibetaanse boeddhisme meerdere stromingen kent, voert de Chinezen wordt het percentage inheemse Tibetanen steeds kleiner.

The '''Tibetan people''' are indigenous to Tibet and surrounding areas stretching from Central Asia in the West to Myanmar and China Proper in the East.

The SIL Ethnologue documents an additional 125,000 Tibetan exiles living in India, 60,000 in Nepal, and 4,000 in Bhutan.

Tibetan exile groups estimate the death toll in Tibet since the invasion of the Chinese government indicate a blossoming of ethnic-Tibetan population from 1.2 million in 1952, to 2.6 million by the end of 2000; much of this being supported by the improved quality of health and lifestyle of the average Tibetan since the beginning of democratic reforms under the Chinese governance resulting in an infant mortality rate of 35.3 per 1,000 in the year 2000, as compared to the 430 infant deaths per 1,000 in 1951<ref>[http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/database/chinadata/tibet.htm Tibet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and an average life expectancy of 35 years in 1950's to over 65 years for the average Tibetan in the 2000's.

==Physical adaptation to high altitudes==

The ability of Tibetans to function normally in the oxygen-deficient atmosphere at high altitudes - frequently above 4,400 metres (14,000 ft), has often puzzled observers. Recent research shows that, although Tibetans living at high altitudes have no more oxygen in their blood than other people, they have 10 times more nitric oxide (NO) and double the forearm blood flow of low-altitude dwellers. Nitric oxide causes dilation of blood vessels allowing blood to flow more freely to the extremities and aids the release of oxygen to tissues. This may also help explain the typical rosy cheeks of high-altitude dwellers. What is not yet known is whether the high levels of nitric oxide are due to a genetic mutation or whether people from lower altitudes would gradually adapt similarly after living for prolonged periods at high altitudes.<ref>"Special Blood allows Tibetans to live the high life." ''New Scientist''. 3 November 2007, p. 19.</ref><ref>"Elevated nitric oxide in blood is key to high altitude function for Tibetans."[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-10/cwru-eno103007.php]</ref><ref>"Tibetans Get Their Blood Flowing"[http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2007/1029/2]</ref><ref>"Nitric oxide and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in Tibetan highlanders."[http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/99/5/1796]</ref>

== Origins ==
The Han Chinese and "proto-Tibeto-Burman" may have split sometime before 4000 BC, when the Han began growing millet in the Yellow River valley while the Tibeto-Burmans remained nomads; Tibet split from Burma circa 500 . The Tibetan language is a member of the Tibeto-Burman branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. <ref>*Su, Bing, ''et al.'' [http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/HG_2000_v107_p582.pdf "Y chromosome haplotypes reveal prehistorical migrations to the Himalayas"]. ''Human Genetics'' 107, 2000: 582&ndash;590.

Very little is known about the origins of the Tibetan people. Some argue that Tibetans share a genetic background with Mongols, although it is clear that other main influences do exist. Some anthropologists have suggested a Central Asian or Indo-Scythian component, and others a Southeast Asian component; both are credible given Tibet's geographic location. The romantic claim that American Hopi and Tibetans are close cousins is not likely to find support in genetic studies, although strong cultural similarities may be found between the two groups. Some light has been shed on their origins, however, by one genetic study: Su, Bing, ''et al.'' (2000), in which it was indicated that Tibetan Y-chromosomes had multiple origins, one from Central Asia while the other from East Asia.

=== Traditional explanation ===
Tibetans traditionally explain their own origins as rooted in the marriage of a monkey and a mountain ogress.<ref></ref> Tibetans who display compassion, moderation, intelligence, and wisdom are said to take after their fathers, while Tibetans who are "red-faced, fond of sinful pursuits, and very stubborn" are said to take after their mothers.

== Notable features ==

Tibetans have a legendary ability to survive extremes of altitude and cold, an ability no doubt conditioned by the extreme environment of the Tibetan plateau. Recently, scientists have sought to isolate the cultural and genetic factors behind this adaptability [http://www.cwru.edu/affil/tibet/HAN.html]. Among their findings was a gene which improves oxygen saturation in hemoglobin and the fact that Tibetan children grow faster than other children to the age of five (presumably as a defense against heat loss since larger bodies have a more favorable volume to surface ratio). The [http://paleo.sscnet.ucla.edu/TibetGroupPage.html Tibet Paleolithic Project] is studying the Stone Age colonization of the plateau, hoping to gain insight into human adaptability in general and the cultural strategies the Tibetans developed as they learned to survive in this harsh environment.

== Religion ==

Most Tibetans generally observe Kache.

Legend said that the 28th king of Tibet, Lhatotori Nyentsen, dreamed of a sacred treasure falling from heaven, which contained a Buddhist sutra, mantras, and religious objects. However, because the modern Tibetan script was not introduced to the people, no one knew what was written on the sutra upon the first look. Buddhism did not take root in Tibet until the reign of Songtsen Gampo, who married two Buddhist princesses, Brikhuti and Wencheng. It then gained popularity when Padmasambhava, widely known as Guru Rinpoche, visited Tibet at the invitation of the 38th Tibetan king, Trisong Deutson.

Today, one can see Tibetans placing Mani stones all over. Tibetan lamas, both Buddhist and Bön, play a major role in the lives of the Tibetan people, conducting religious ceremonies and taking care of the monasteries. Pilgrims plant their prayer flags onto the sacred grounds as a symbol of good luck.

The prayer wheel is a means of chanting the mantra by revolving the object several times in a clockwise direction. It is widely seen among Tibetan people. In order not to desecrate religious artifacts such as Stupas, mani stones, and Gompas, Tibetan Buddhists walk around them in a clockwise direction, although the reverse direction is true for Bön. Tibetan Buddhists chant the prayer "Om mani padme hum", while the practitioners of Bön chant "Om matri muye sale du".

== Culture ==

Tibet boasts a rich culture. Tibetan festivals such as Losar, Shoton, Linka (festival), and the Bathing Festival are deeply rooted in indigenous religion and also contain foreign influences. Each person takes part in the Bathing Festival three times: at birth, at marriage, and at death.  It is traditionally believed that people should not bathe casually, but only on the most important occasions.

===Art===
Tibetan art is deeply religious in nature, from the exquisitely detailed statues found in Gompas to wooden carvings and the intricate designs of the Thangka paintings. Tibetan art can be found in almost every object and every aspect of daily life. 

Thangka paintings, a syncretism of Indian scroll-painting with Nepalese and Kashmiri painting, appeared in Tibet around the 8th century. Rectangular and painted on cotton or linen, they usually depict traditional motifs including religious, astrological, and theological subjects, and sometimes the Mandala. To ensure that the image will not fade, organic and mineral pigments are added, and the painting is framed in colorful silk brocades.

===Drama===
The Tibetan folk opera, known as ''Ache lhamo'', which literally means "sister goddess" or "celestial sister," is a combination of dances, chants and songs. The repertoire is drawn from Buddhist stories and Tibetan history.
