Some '''drugs''' have been '''withdrawn''' from the market because of risks to the patients. Usually this has been prompted by unexpected adverse effects that were not detected during Phase III clinical trials and were only apparent from postmarketing surveillance data from the wider patient community.

Certains '''médicaments''' ont été '''retirés du marché''' après y avoir été introduits à cause de risques pour les patients. 

En général, il s'agit d'effets secondaires imprévus qui n'avaient pas été détectés lors des essais cliniques et ne sont apparus qu'à l'occasion de données issues de la pharmacovigilance ou d'études de phase IV (Post-commercialisation).
