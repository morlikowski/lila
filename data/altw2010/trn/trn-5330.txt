'''جدار الفصل العنصري''' ، أ جدار الضم و التوسع العنصري حسب التسمية الفلسطينية (أو جدار الفصل العنصري)، او السياج الأمني الفاصل، حسب التسمية الإسرائيلة هو مشروع قيد التنفيذ حتى الان (الضفة الغربية عن إسرائيل.

==إنشائه==
بدأ إنشائه في عهد حكومة ارئيل شارون في شهر يونيو حزيران عام 2002 ، وصرحت الحكومة الإسرائيلية آنذاك ان "السياج الامني يتم بنائه بهدف انقاذ حياة المواطنين الاسرائيليين الذين يستمر استهدافهم من قبل الحملة الارهابية التي بدأت عام 2000".

==بنائه==
left|200px|
الجدار مبني من الإسمنت بارنفاع يتراوح بين 4.5 و 9 متر في المناطق المأهولة بالسكان الفلسطينيين و سياج الكتروني في المناطق غير المأهولة بالفلسطينيين، ، وبالرغم ان 15% من مقاطع الجدار تمتد على حدود عام بالخط الاخضر الا ان الباقي يبنى/سيبنى في الاراضي التي احتلت عام ارئيل ، ومسار الجدار يمر عبر ارضي مأهولة وزراعية في الضفة الغربية ، كما وصول الفلسطينين إلى الشوارع المحلية وحقول المزارعين الفلسطينيين . كما ان مسار الجدار في المنطقة الشمالية يعزل أكثر من 5 الاف فلسطيني في مناطق "مغلقة" بين الخط الاخضر والجدار ، وقامت السلطات الإسرائيلية بتأسيس شبكة من البوابات في الجدار ونظام تصاريح مرور للتحرك خلال الجدار التي اثبتت عدم جدواها في توفير حياة عادية للسكان ، وفيما تقول الحكومة الإسرائيلية ان الهدف من بناء الجدار هو حماية المواطنين الإسرائيلين من الهجمات الانتحارية الفلسطينة ، يقول الفلسطينيون ان شبكة الجدران ، الاسوار والخنادق هي سرقة لاراضيهم وتقسيم للتجمعات السكانية وتفصل المواطنين عن المدارس واماكن العمل .

وقد بني القسم الأكبر من الجدار في مناطق شمال الضفة الغربية وهو يحيط بمدينة قلقيلية ومناطق شمال الضفة الاخرى ، وسيضم المخطط كبرى المستوطنات الإسرائيلة في المناطق المحتلة عام 1967 إلى منطقة تكون متصلة بإسرائيل ولا يفصلها جدار عنها (كأصبع ارئيل) ، ويؤكد الفلسطينون ان مثل هذا الاجراء هو فرض امر واقع على اي اتفاق يمكن التوصل اليه مستقبلا ، وان مثل هذه الشبكة لن تمنح محاولات بناء دولة فلسطينة قابلة للحياة اي فرصة.

==الخط الزمني لتاريخ الجدار[http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/docs/UN/OCHA/OCHABarRprt-Updt6-En.pdf]==
*نوفمبر تشرين ثاني 2000 : رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي إيهود باراك يقر خطة لإنشاء جدر في القسم الشمالي والأوسط من الضفة الغربية لمنع مرور المركبات.
*يوليو حزيران 2001 : رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي أرئيل شارون يقوم بتشكيل لجنة توجيهية برئاسة عوزي دايان ، مدير مجلس الأمن القومي الإسرائيلي بهدف تطوير خطة أكثر شمولية لمنع المسلحين الفلسطينيين من التسلل إلى المناطق الإسرائيلية. وقد أدت توصيات هذه اللجنة إلى تنفيذ وتوسيع خطة باراك السابقة بحيث يتم بناء جدار يمنع الفلسطينيين من العبور سيرا على الأقدام إلى إسرائيل في مناطق تشكل تهديد كبير على منطقة من الأرض تمتد على جانبي الخط الأخضر.
*أبريل نيسان 2002 :الحكومة الإسرائيلية تقرر الشروع ببناء جدار مكون من مقاطع سياجية وجدران إسمنتية في ثلاثة مناطق من الضفة الغربية، كما تم إنشاء "إدارة منطقة الفصل" برئاسة مدير عام وزارة الدفاع، كما بدأت قوات الجيش الإسرائيلي بمصادرة الأراضي وتجريفها. يأتي هذا القرار بعد موجة من الهجمات الإنتحارية في المدن الإسرئيلية أدت إلى سقوط العشرات من القتلى ومئات الجرحى من الإسرائيليين.
*يونيو حزيران 2002 : إدارة منطقة الفصل تشرع ببناء المرحلة الأولى من الجدار بناء على إقرار الخطة من خلال قرار الحكومة الإسرائيلية رقم 2077 الصادر في اجتماع الحكومة الإسرائيلية بتاريخ 23 يونيو حزيران، وتنص هذه الخطة على بناء مقاطع من الجدار في شمال الضفة الغربية، وعلى الحدود الشمالية والجنوبية من "غلاف القدس".
*14 أغسطس آب 2002 : الحكومة الإسرائيلية تقر مسار المرحلة الأولى من الجدار المكون من 123كم من الجدران والأسيجة في مناطق شمال الضفة بالإضافة إلى 20 كم حول القدس.
*أكتوبر تشرين أول 2003 : الحكومة الإسرئيلية تصدر الخطة الكاملة لمسار الجدار في الضفة الغربية.
*30 يونيو حزيران 2004 : الحكومة الإسرائيلية تصدر تعديلا على مسار الجدار المعلن سابقا.
*30 يونيو حزيران 2004 : محكمة العدل العليا الإسرائيلية تصدر قرارا يوجب أخذ الإعتبارات الإنسانية للمدنيين الفلسطينيين بالحسبان أثناء تخطيط وبناء الجدار.
*9 يوليو تموز 2004 : محكمة العدل الدولية تصدر رأيا إستشاريا ينص على أن الجدار الذي يتم بناؤه في الضفة الغربية يخالف القانون الدولي، وتطالب بتفكيك الجدار وتعويض المتضررين.
*20 يوليو تموز 2004 : أكدت الجمعية العمومية للأمم المتحدة على القرار الإستشاري الصادر عن محكمة العدل الدولية .
*20 فبراير شباط 2005 : الحكومة الإسرائيلية تصدر تعديلا على مسار الجدار المعلن سابقا.
*15 سبتمبر أيلول 2005 : محكمة العدل العليا الإسرائيلية تقول أن الجدار لا يخالف القانون الدولي، وأنها ستواصل فحص تأثير مقاطع من الجدار على السكان الفلسطينيين وذلك بتناقض صارخ مع قرار محكمة العدل الدولية.
*30 ابريل نيسان 2006 : الحكومة الإسرائيلية تقر مسارا معدلا للجدار.

==الوضع القانوني==

*أصدرت محكمة العدل الدولية في لاهاي في 9 يوليو 2004 رأيا استشاريا يقضي بعدم شرعية الجدار الفاصل.
*150 بلدا عضوا في الجمعية العامة للأمم المتحدة، من ضمنهم جميع دول الاتحاد الأوروبي الخمسة والعشرين حينها، صوتوا لصالح القرار الذي تم تبنيه في وقت متأخر من مساء الثلاثاء الولايات المتحدة واستراليا وإسرائيل، وامتنعت عن التصويت 10 دول.

وقرار الجمعية العامة، مثل قرار محكمة العدل الدولية، غير ملزم لإسرائيل. غير أن أهمية القيمة الرمزية والمعنوية للقرارين قد تساعد الفلسطينيين والأطراف المعارضة لبناء الجدار على ممارسة المزيد من الضغط السياسي على إسرائيل لتفكيك الجدار.

Most significant, successful suicide bombings in Israel nearly came to a halt. Last year, only two Palestinian suicide bombers managed to sneak into Israel for attacks that killed 11 people and wounded 30 others. Israel has gone nearly nine months without a suicide bombing inside its borders, the longest period without such an attack since 2000.…An Israeli military spokeswoman said one major factor in that success had been Israel's controversial separation barrier, a still-growing  network of concrete walls, high-tech fencing and other obstacles that cuts through parts of the West Bank. ‘The security fence was put up to stop terror, and that's what it's doing,’ said Capt. Noa Meir, a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces.…Opponents of the wall grudgingly acknowledge that it's been effective in stopping bombers, though they complain that its route should have followed the border between Israel and the Palestinian territories known as the Green Line.</small>

When you finally get through, you have to trudge through a no-man's-land to pick up a bus or taxi.…Until the start of the current round of violence (the second intifada, in September 2000), 85,000 Israelis and Palestinians used to pour into Qalquilya every week to visit the shops and markets. Goods were cheaper than in Israel. No one comes any more, partly out of fear, partly because it's so hard to get in or out. And now the wall threatens to cut the town off from 80 per cent of its agricultural land and 19 of its wells.…Before the construction started, half of Qalquilya's income came from agriculture. Now, 4,000 people - 10 per cent of the population - have left. An additional 2,200 heads of household have gone to find work elsewhere, leaving their families behind.…Unemployment is now 69 per cent. With its bottleneck entrance so often corked, the town is coming close to economic strangulation. More than 600 businesses have closed and many residents have been unable to pay their municipal taxes, with the result that the Qalquilya municipality owes approximately 3.5 m shekels (£490,000) to the Israeli Electric Company, which is threatening to cut off the city's supply.…The story of overcrowding and economic peril will be repeated in other Palestinian cities, according to Jamal Juma, co-ordinator of the Palestinian Environmental Network: ‘In 10 years, there will be no room to expand. Forced off the land, Palestinians will be clustered into already heavily populated urban areas; with no alternative sources of income, they will be a source of cheap labour for Israeli factories.’</small>

It is the whole Arab populace that delights in murder and mayhem, and have done so for the years that they have been here. They can no longer extol those who murder and are suicide bombers, and U.S. President Bush, or anyone else should not have double standards, and have Israel tolerate the hostile positions of the Arabs.

Two similar barriers, the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier and the Israeli-built<ref>http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3072620,00.html</ref>  wall separating Gaza from Egypt (temporarily breached on January 23, 2008 - Breach of the Gaza-Egypt border (2008)), have been much less controversial.<ref name="timesonline_2008"></ref>

== Overview ==
=== Names of the barrier ===
The naming of the barrier is controversial. Israelis most commonly refer to the barrier as the "separation ''(hafrada)'' fence" (, ''gader ha'hafrada'' or ''geder ha'hafrada'') and "security fence" or "anti-terrorist fence", with "seam zone" referring to the land between the fence and the 1949 armistice lines.

Palestinians most commonly refer to the barrier in Arabic as , (racial segregation wall), and  some opponents of the barrier refer to it in English as the "Apartheid Wall", even though less than 10% of the planned total length of the barrier can accurately be described as a "wall".<ref name = "Al-J Wall">{{cite web

The BBC's style guide for journalists states "The BBC uses the terms ''barrier'', ''separation barrier'' or ''West Bank barrier'' as acceptable generic descriptions to avoid the political connotations of "security fence" (preferred by the Israeli government) or "apartheid wall" (preferred by the Palestinians)."<ref name="bbc_Key_terms"></ref>

Sometimes various other names including separation/security and fence/wall/barrier are used.

=== History and stated purpose ===
The idea of creating a physical barrier between the Israeli and Palestinian populations was first proposed by Yitzhak Rabin in 1992, following the murder of an Israeli teenage girl in Jerusalem. Rabin said that Israel must "take Gaza out of Tel Aviv", in order to minimize friction between the peoples.<ref name = "Makovsky">{{cite journal

}}
</ref> Following an outbreak of violent incidents in Gaza in October 1994, Rabin announced his stance that "we have to decide on separation as a philosophy. There has to be a clear border. Without demarcating the lines, whoever wants to swallow 1.8 million Arabs will just bring greater support for Hamas."<ref name = "Makovsky" />

To this end, the government of Yitzhak Rabin built the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier in 1994. Following an attack on HaSharon Junction, near the city of Netanya, Rabin made his goals more specific:

<blockquote>This path must lead to a separation, though not according to the borders prior to 1967. We want to reach a separation between us and them. We do not want a majority of the Jewish residents of the state of Israel, 98% of whom live within the borders of sovereign Israel, including a united Jerusalem, to be subject to terrorism.</blockquote>

In early 1995, the Shahal commission was established by Yitzhak Rabin to discuss how to implement a barrier separating Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, prior to the Camp David 2000 Summit with Yasser Arafat, vowed to build a separation barrier, stating that it is "essential to the Palestinian nation in order to foster its national identity and independence without being dependent on the State of Israel".<ref name = "Makovsky" />

The Israeli Supreme Court made reference to the conditions and history that led to the building of the barrier. In the September 2005 decision,<ref name = "HCF" /> it described the history of violence against Israeli citizens since the breakout of al-Aqsa Intifada and the loss of life that ensued on the Israeli side. The court ruling also cited the attempts Israel had made to defend its citizens, including "military operations" carried out against "terrorist acts", and stated that these actions...
<blockquote>
...did not provide a sufficient answer to the immediate need to stop the severe acts of terrorism. . . . Despite all these measures, the terror did not come to an end. The attacks did not cease. Innocent people paid with both life and limb. This is the background behind the decision to construct the separation fence (Id., at p. 815)</blockquote>

==== Grassroots effort ====
In June 2001, a grass roots organization called "Fence for Life - The Public Movement for The Security Fence"<!--ref>http://www.hagader.com/English/main.asp</ref--> began the grassroots effort for the construction of a continuous security fence. The movement was founded by people from all over Israel following the Dolphinarium discotheque suicide bombing. 

The stated goal of the movement is to encourage the government to construct a security fence along Israel's borders. "Fence for Life" urged the government to build a continuous fence as speedily as possible, and without any connection to the political future of the areas it separates, with a goal of hermetically sealing off the Palestinian territories from Israeli population centers to prevent the terrorist acts by Palestinians against the people living in Israel. 

The "Fence for Life" campaign emphasized that any security fence has no connection whatsoever to the political future of the settlements. The Movement for the Security Fence for Israel included protests, demonstrations, conferences with public figures, media blitzes, lobbying in the Knesset as well as legal battles in the High Court of Justice, both with demands to quickly build the security fence as well as appeals not to cause further delay in construction. The movement does not support any specific path for the barrier, as this is subject to a government decision. "Fence for Life" was of the opinion that "politicization" of the fence by various groups was delaying the completion of the security barrier and is likely to block its construction. At the end of 2002, due to government inaction, several localities who suffered the most from lack of a border barrier had started to build the barrier using their own funds directly on the green-line.<ref name = "Gilboa">{{cite web

==== Government action ====
Although the government of Prime Minister terrorists from entering Israeli cities, a problem which has plagued Israel since the start of the Second Intifada. A secondary purpose of the barrier is to prevent illegal infiltrations by Palestinians, mainly illegal immigrants and car thieves. The Israeli government says that the high concrete portions are to protect cars and people on the Israeli side from gunfire. Many Israelis note the danger of terrorist incursions from the area, such as waves of suicide bombings in early 2002.

According to Natan Sharansky, Minister of Housing and Construction at the time:
<blockquote>When Israel's free society was defending itself against an unprecedented campaign of terror, most of the international community was calling for an end of the "cycle of violence" and a return to the negotiating table. When the Palestinian terrorists struck... Israel was condemned for imposing "collective punishment" on the Palestinian population. When Israel chose to target individual terrorists with precision air strikes, its actions were condemned as illegal extrajudicial assassinations. It seemed that in eyes of many, the Jews had a right to defend themselves in theory but could not exercise that right in practice... our government understood that there were three options to maintain an acceptable level of security for our citizens. The first was to wage a total war against Palestinian terror using weapons that would claim many innocent Palestinian lives. The second was to keep our reserves constantly mobilized to defend the country. The third option was to build the security fence. Had the Palestinian Authority become a partner in fighting terror, as it was obliged to do under all the agreements that it signed, none of these options would have become necessary.<ref>Natan Sharansky: ''The Case for Democracy'' p.214</ref></blockquote>

=== Route and route timeline ===
The barrier generally runs along or near the 1949 Jordanian-Israeli armistice/Green Line, but diverges in many places to include on the Israeli side several of the highly populated areas of Ariel, Gush Etzion, Emmanuel, Karnei Shomron, Givat Ze'ev, Oranit, and Maale Adumim.<ref>{{cite web

As of November 2003, the barrier extends inside most of the northwestern and western edges of the West Bank, sometimes close to the Green Line, and sometimes running further east. In some places there are also secondary barriers, creating a number of completely enclosed enclaves. 

In February 2004, Israel said it would review the route of the barrier in response to U.S. and Palestinian concerns. In particular, Israeli cabinet members said modifications would be made to reduce the number of checkpoints Palestinians had to cross, and especially to reduce Palestinian hardship in areas such as Qalqilyah where the barrier goes very near, and in some cases nearly encircles, populated areas.

On June 30, 2004, the Supreme Court of Israel ruled that a portion of the barrier west of Jerusalem violates the rights of Palestinians, and ordered 30&nbsp;km of existing and planned barrier to be rerouted. However, it did rule that the barrier is legal in essence and accepted the Israeli government's claim that it is a security measure. On July 9, 2004, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion that it is a violation of international law. At the beginning of September 2004, Israel started the southern part of the barrier.

On Samarian highlands of the West Bank, separating them from the Jordan valley.<ref>[http://www.arij.org/paleye/Segregation-Wall/7.5%20The%20full%20extent%20of%20the%20segregation%20Zones%20in%20the%20West%20Bank.pdf]</ref> 

Following a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, the route was again revised by a cabinet decision on Ariel area, the new route corrects an anomaly of the previous route that would have left thousands of Palestinians on the Israeli side. The Alfei Menashe settlement bloc was reduced in size, and the new plan leaves three groups of Palestinian houses on the Palestinian side of the fence. The barrier's route in the Jerusalem area will leave Beit Iksa on the Palestinian side; and Jaba on the Israeli side, but with a crossing to the Palestinian side at Tzurif. Further changes were made to the route around Eshkolot and Metzadot Yehuda, and the route from Metzadot to Har Choled was approved.<ref>[http://www.seamzone.mod.gov.il/Pages/ENG/news.htm#news45 Israel Security Fence - Ministry of Defense<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== Structure ===
Most of the barrier (over 95% of total length) consists of a "multi-layered fence system"<ref name="securityfence"></ref> ideally 50&nbsp;m in width. The IDF's preferred design has three fences, with pyramid-shaped stacks of barbed wire for the two outer fences and a lighter-weight fence with intrusion detection equipment in the middle. Patrol roads are provided on both sides of the middle fence, an anti-vehicle ditch is located on the West Bank side of the fence, and a smooth dirt strip on the Israeli side for "intrusion tracking". 

Some sections (less than 5% of total length) are constructed as a wall made up of concrete slabs up to 8&nbsp;m in height and 3&nbsp;m in width. Occasionally, due to topographic conditions other sections of the barrier will reach up to 100&nbsp;m in width.<ref name="nad-plo"></ref> Wall construction (5%) is more common in urban settings, such as areas near Qalqilyah and Jerusalem, because it is narrower, requires less land, and provides more protection against snipers. In all cases there are regular observation posts, automated sensing devices and other apparatus. Gates at various points are controlled by Israeli soldiers.

== Effects and consequences ==
=== Effects on Israeli security ===
Israeli statistics indicate that the barrier has drastically reduced the number of Palestinian infiltrations and suicide bombings and other attacks on civilians in Israel and in Israeli settlements, and Israeli officials assert that completion of the barrier will make it even more effective in stopping these attacks<ref>[http://securityfence.mfa.gov.il/mfm/Data/48152.doc Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]</ref> since "An absolute halt in terrorist activities has been noticed in the West Bank areas where the fence has been constructed".<ref>[http://www.nclci.org/news/terrorism_news.htm]</ref> 

Israeli officers (including the head of the Islamic Jihad, had confirmed that the barrier made it much harder to conduct attacks inside Israel. Since the completion of the fence in the area of Tulkarem and Qalqilyah in June 2003, there have been no successful attacks from those areas. All attacks were intercepted or the suicide bombers detonated prematurely.<ref name = "Makovsky" />  In a March 23, 2008 interview, Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Ramadan Abdallah Shalah complained to the Qatari newspaper ''Al-Sharq'' that the separation barrier "limits the ability of the resistance to arrive deep within [Israeli territory] to carry out suicide bombing attacks , but the resistance has not surrendered or become helpless, and is looking for other ways to cope with the requirements of every stage" of the intifada.<ref>[http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/html/ct_250308e.htm Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Israel Intelligence Heritage & Commemoration Center (IICC)]</ref>

There is general agreement that effects to date have coincided with improved Israeli security.<ref name = "McClatchy" /><ref name = "Q26">{{cite web

However, there is debate over how effective the barrier has been in preventing terrorist attacks. A report by the Shin Beit, published in early 2006 notes that terror attacks in 2005 have significantly decreased due to increased pursuing of Palestinian militants by the Israeli army and intelligence organizations, Hamas's increased political activity, and a truce among Palestinian militant groups in the Palestinian Territories. According to ''Haaretz'' the report also mentions that "The security fence is no longer mentioned as the major factor in preventing suicide bombings, mainly because the terrorists have found ways to bypass it."<ref name="Shin Bet Truce"></ref>

=== Effects on demography and asset values ===
According to a 2005 report published by the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies, the barrier being built around Jerusalem may have unintended effects on the city. According to the study, many Jerusalem Palestinians who were living in areas outside the barrier are now moving back into the city, creating housing shortages, increased real estate prices, and the phenomena of Palestinians moving into traditionally Jewish neighborhoods of the city.<ref>[http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=632264 Your Financial News Source<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== Effects on Palestinians ===
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: thumb|"The barrier on the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line, separating the Israeli-Palestinian town of Nazlat Issa inside the West Bank (right.)"]] -->
The barrier has many effects on Palestinians including reduced freedoms, reduction of Israeli checkpoint and closures, loss of land, increased difficulty in accessing medical services in Israel, restricted access to water sources, change in political tactics and strategy, and economic effects.

In an interview with ''Al-Sharq'', Palestinian Islamic Jihad, mentioned that the Second Intifada was currently characterized by rocket fire , which had replaced the previous stage of suicide bombing attacks. That, he said, was because Israel had found ways and means to protect itself from such attacks: "For example, they built a separation fence in the West Bank. We do not deny that it limits the ability of the militants to arrive deep within Israeli territory to carry out suicide bombing attacks."<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/html/ct_250308e.htm Palestinian Islamic Jihad<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==== Reduced freedoms ====
In a 2005 report, the UN stated that: 

</ref>|Introduction UN report Pg4}}

An often-quoted example of the effects of the barrier is the Palestinian town of Green Line between the city and the nearby Trans-Israel Highway. The wall in this section, referred to as an "anti-sniper wall," has been claimed to prevent gun attacks against Israeli motorists on the nearby Trans-Israel Highway.<ref name="BBC_Q&A_September_2005"></ref>  The city is accessible through a main road from the east, and an underground tunnel built in September 2004 on the south side connects Qalqilyah with the adjacent village of Habla. Recently, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the government to change the route of the barrier in this area to ease movement of Palestinians between Qalqilyah and 5 surrounding villages. In the same ruling, the court rejected the arguments that the fence must be built only on the Green Line. The ruling cited the topography of the terrain, security considerations, and sections 43 and 52 of The Hague Regulations 1907 and Article 53 of the 4th Geneva Convention as reasons for this rejection.<ref name = "HCF" />

In early October 2003, the IDF OC Central Command declared the area between the separation barrier in the northern section of the West Bank (Stage 1) and the Green Line a closed military area for an indefinite period of time. New directives stated that every Palestinian over the age of twelve living in the enclaves created in the closed area have to obtain a “permanent resident permit” from the Civil Administration to enable them to continue to live in their homes. Other residents of the West Bank have to obtain special permits to enter the area.<ref name = "BTStat" />

==== Decreased checkpoints and closures ====
In June 2004, the Washington Times<ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20040624-112922-9037r.htm Washington Times - Mideast security barrier working<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> reported that the reduced need for Israeli military incursions in Jenin have prompted efforts to rebuild damaged streets and buildings and a gradual return to a semblance of normality, and in a letter<ref>[http://www.israel-un.org/committees/duggardrprt.htm The Israeli Government's Official Website, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> dated October 25, 2004, from the Israeli mission to Kofi Annan, Israel's government pointed out that a number of restrictions east of the barrier have been lifted as a result of the barrier, including a reduction in checkpoints from 71 to 47 and roadblocks from 197 to 111. The Jerusalem Post reports that, for some Palestinians who are Israeli citizens living in the Israeli Arab town of Umm el-Fahm (population 42,000) near Jenin, the barrier has "significantly improved their lives" because, on one hand, it prevents would-be thieves or terrorists from coming to their town and, on the other hand, has increased the flow of customers from other parts of Israel who would normally have patronised Palestinian business in the West Bank, resulting in an economic boom. The report states that the downsides are that the barrier has divided families in half and "damaged Israeli Arabs' solidarity with the Palestinians living on the other side of the Green Line".<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/Printer&cid=1087441302553 Variables.theArticle:headline | Jerusalem Post<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

A UN report released in August 2005 observed that the existence of the barrier "replaced the need for closures: movement within the northern West Bank, for example, is less restrictive where the Barrier has been constructed. Physical obstacles have also been removed in Ramallah and Jerusalem governorates where the Barrier is under construction." The report notes that more freedom of movement in rural areas may ease Palestinian access to hospitals and schools, but also notes that restrictions on movement between urban population centers have not significantly changed.<ref>http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/docs/UN/OCHA/ochaHU0805_En.pdf</ref><!--

====Political impact====
The barrier's political impact is quite substantial and not what one might expect. The mere prospect of the wall already has created a bizarre political situation: "The barrier has united, of all people, the Palestinians and their arch-enemies, the Jewish settlers. The settlers oppose the wall because they are left outside its protection. The Palestinians oppose it because it looks like a unilateral drawing of borders by Israel. On the other side are Israelis who don't live on settlements. [sic] One recent poll shows 68% approval of the wall, which would protect major cities that have been subjected to bombings. If the Palestinians come to their senses, they'll realize that the current terrorism policy, which is producing the wall and economic isolation, will leave them worse off in every way.... Yet the wall also holds the seeds of a peace deal. It would in effect be a secure border for Israel precisely where the Palestinians want it.... It's hardly inevitable, but the wall just might be a surprising start down the road to a Middle East peace deal."<ref>http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jul2002/nf20020718_1722.htm</ref>/ -->

====Loss of land====

Parts of the barrier are built on land confiscated from Palestinians.<ref name="CNN_November_2003"></ref><ref name="BBC_Q&A_September_2005"/> In a recent report, the UN noted that the most recent barrier route allocates more segments to be built on the Green Line itself compared to previous draft routes of the barrier.<ref name="humanitarianinfo_Rprt05"/>

As of May 2004, the fence construction had already uprooted an estimated 102,320 Palestinian olive and citrus trees, demolished 75 acres (0.3&nbsp;km²) of greenhouses and 23&nbsp;miles (37&nbsp;km) of irrigation pipes. At that point, it rested on 15,000 dunums (3,705&nbsp;acres or 15&nbsp;km²) of confiscated land, only meters away from a number of small villages, or hamlets. In early 2003, in order to move a section of the barrier to the Green Line, a ramshackle mall of 63 shops straddling that line into Israel was demolished by the IDF in the village of Nazlat Issa after giving their owners 30 minutes notice.<ref name="humanitarianinfo_2004"></ref><ref name="nytimes_Jan_2003"></ref>  In August 2003, an additional 115 shops and stalls (an important source of income for several communities) and five to seven homes there were also demolished.<ref>[http://www.miftah.org/Display.cfm?DocId=2401&CategoryId=4 MIFTAH-Bad Fences Make Bad Neighbors – Part V: Focus on Zayta<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.palestinemonitor.org/factsheet/wall_fact_sheet.htm</ref> The Israeli government has promised that trees affected by the construction will be replanted.<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Palestinian+terror+since+2000/Saving%20Lives-%20Israel-s%20anti-terrorist%20fence%20-%20Answ Saving Lives- Israel's anti-terrorist fence - FAQ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
