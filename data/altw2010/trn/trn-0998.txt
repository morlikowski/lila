 is a weekly shōnen manga magazine published by Shogakukan.

== History ==
''Shōnen Sunday'' was first published on Tuesday, March 17, 1959, the same day as its rival ''Shōnen Magazine''. The debut issue featured Shigeo Nagashima, the star player of the Yomiuri Giants on the cover, and a congratulatory article by Isoko Hatano, a noted child psychologist.

Despite its name, ''Shōnen Sunday'' is published on Wednesdays of each week. The "Sunday" in the name was the creation of its first editor, Kiichi Toyoda, who wanted the title to be evocative of a relaxing weekend.

thumb|left|''Weekly Shōnen Sunday's mascot'', Issue 1991-#37Shōnen Sunday's distinctive "pointing finger" that appears in the lower corner of every page on the left side of the magazine made its subtle debut in the 4/5 issue from 1969. This understated feature, ever present but easily overlooked, was referenced as a plot element in 20th Century Boys. Sunday's more noticeable mascot, a helmeted fish debuted in the 1980s. 

Prior to the 1990s and 2000s no serial in Shōnen Sunday had run over 40 volumes, but that began to change with series such as MAJOR, InuYasha, and Karakuri Circus, which maintained a high level of popularity. Consequently, another change that has met with mixed feelings is the early discontinuation of series by non-veteran mangaka which has led to newer artists, Kōji Kumeta for example, leaving for other publishers' magazines.

In a rare event due to the closeness of the two magazine's founding dates, Weekly Shōnen Sunday and Weekly Shōnen Magazine released a special combined issue<ref name="Shōnen Sunday's 50th Anniversary">{{cite news |url=http://www.furinkan.com/features/articles/shonensunday50.html |publisher=Rumic World
