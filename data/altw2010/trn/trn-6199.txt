The naval '''Battle of Hansan Island''', also known as the '''Battle of Hansan-do''', took place on Hansan, and was one of the most important battles of the Imjin War. Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin destroyed at least 47 Japanese ships, captured 12 and killed over 8,000 Japanese sailors and marines. Yi's success in this battle became a turning point in the war.

==Prelude==
Admiral Yi Sun Shin, along with the small fleet of seven ships of Admiral Won Kyun, had fought two campaigns across the southern coast of Korea. Admiral Yi Eok Ki joined Admirals Yi and Won for the third campaign. In all, the Koreans sank over 100 Japanese ships and inflicted thousands of casualties. Admiral Yi and the combined Korean fleet did not lose any ships and suffered only 11 killed and 26 wounded up to this point.

Given the importance that the Japanese navy had in supplying the army as it advanced along the Korean peninsula and prepared to invade China, Toyotomi Hideyoshi made it absolutely imperative to his commanders that the naval situation must be brought under control, the Korean fleets destroyed and the supply routes through the Yellow Sea secured. The Japanese commander, Wakizaka Yasuharu, was ordered to wait and combine his fleet with the forces of Katō Yoshiaki and Kuki Yoshitaka to seek out and destroy the Korean fleet. However, it would have taken some time for Katō and Kuki to assemble their ships, so Wakizaka went out alone with 73 ships. Wakizaka's fleet probably had the best war ships fielded by the Japanese up to that point in the war. Out of the 73 ships, 36 were the large multi-decked atakebune, 24 the medium sized seki bune and 13 small kobaya scout ships.

In the meantime, Admiral Yi was planning a third campaign and worked with Admirals Won and Yi Eok Ki in combined operations and practiced arranging their fleets in a "crane's wing" battle formation.  The formation was often used on land, but not normally used at sea. The combined fleets had a total of 54 panokseons and 2 or 3 turtle ships.

==The Battle==
===First phase===
Admiral Yi received intelligence from a local farmer that a large Japanese fleet (Wakizaka's ships) was making its way west towards him and was anchored north of the Gyeonnaeryang Strait, a narrow channel between Geoje Island and the mainland.

On August 14th, the next morning, Admiral Yi sent out six panokson battle ships through the channel to lure out Wakizaka's fleet.  Wakizaka took the bait and his ships chased Yi's six panoksons through the channel and into the broad open sea in front of Hansan Island.  Wakizaka saw Admiral Yi's fleet before him and pressed to engage the Koreans.  At that time, Admiral Yi began to arrange the fleet in the crane wing formation.

====Crane wing formation====
In the two previous campaigns, the Koreans had either met the Japanese ships in a straight battle line or, if space was limited, with a circular or rolling method of attack, where their ships attacked in relays to sustain a continuous bombardment. Although these tactics were effective, considerable numbers of Japanese had escaped and swum ashore. The crane wing formation was designed to not just sink ships, but to annihilate the enemy without losing a lot of men.

The formation itself resembled a "U" shape, with the heaviest battleships in the center and lighter ships on the wings. Reserves were placed behind the central ships and would plug gaps as the formation expanded. Ships at the front of the formation would face broadsides to maximize the number of cannons that would be aimed at the enemy. Furthermore, the "U" shape itself would allow for interlocking fields of fire so that many Japanese ships would be enfiladed and hit from several angles. In this sense the Crane Wing formation shared similarities with the late 19th and early 20th century battleship tactic of 'Crossing the T'.

The Japanese tactic was to put their fastest ships in the vanguard to keep the Korean ships occupied, then move their larger ships rapidly to close in, grapple, and board the Korean ships. However, this tactic played right into Admiral Yi's plan, as the Japanese rowed deeper into the trap. The volume and range of Korean cannon fire prevented the Japanese from employing their favorite tactic and the two wings of the crane formation would envelope, surround and finally have the effect of "crowding in" the Japanese ships, making it difficult to maneuver or retreat and "packing" in the ships and present an easier target for Korean cannons.

'''閑山島海戦'''（かんざんとうかいせん）は、文禄の役における海戦の一つ。
文禄元年(1592年)7月7日に閑山島と巨済島の間の海峡で単独出撃をした脇坂安治の水軍が朝鮮水軍の誘引迎撃戦術により撃破された海戦。

== 海戦の背景 ==
文禄元年(1592年)4月の釜山上陸以来、見るべき抵抗の無かった朝鮮南岸に対し、侵攻作戦こそ無いものの策源地の釜山を中心に番外の所隊が支配領域拡大のために展開をしていた。これらの部隊の海上移動にあたっていた海運部隊が李舜臣を中心とする朝鮮水軍の5月と6月の二度の出撃で大きな被害を出していた。これに対処するために豊臣秀吉は6月23日付けの書状で陸戦や後方輸送に従事していた脇坂安治（動員定数1500人）、九鬼嘉隆（動員定数1500人）、加藤嘉明（動員定数750人）の三大名を招集し朝鮮水軍を討つように命じた。

== 閑山島海戦の経過 ==
6月14日に三大名は釜山浦に集結したが、功名に逸った脇坂安治は抜け駆けをして7月7日に巨済島へ単独出撃をした。

一方、二度の出撃で戦果を上げた朝鮮水軍の全羅左水使・李舜臣（24隻）は7月6日に日本水軍の動きを察知すると直ちに出撃し、慶尚右水使・元均（7隻）と全羅右水使・李億祺（25隻）の水軍と合流した。

7月8日、日本艦隊を発見した李舜臣は出撃を主張する元均を抑え、囮と潮流を使った迎撃作戦を展開した。また、この艦隊には亀船三隻が参加していたという。
囮と海流に乗って出撃した脇坂艦隊は有力な朝鮮水軍の迎撃を受け大きな被害を出し、脇坂安治も窮地に陥るが、座乗船の大きさと櫂の数による機動性を生かして撤退に成功した。

李舜臣は自身の記録である「見乃梁破倭状」で日本艦隊の発見数を大船36隻・中船24隻・小船13隻、撃破数を63隻と記録している。
しかし、脇坂安治への動員定数が1500人であることを考えると発見数と戦果は過大評価の可能性が高い。(翌年5月の晋州城攻撃時の脇坂軍の点呼員数は900人)

この海戦で脇坂安治は部将の脇坂左兵衛と渡辺七衛門を失い、海賊出身の真鍋左馬允は船を失って上陸後に責任感から切腹した。また脇坂艦隊の内、海戦中に船を放棄して閑山島に上陸した者が200人生還している。
