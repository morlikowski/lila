'''Натаниел Хоторн''' (американския ренесанс. Най-известните му произведения са ''„Алената буква“'' (американски писатели, които изследват дълбоките мотиви в поведението на героите си. Централна тема в творчеството му е чувството за вина, породено от конфликта между стремежа към лично щастие и ограниченията на обществените норми за поведение.

Натаниел Хоторн е роден в Салем, 24), където негов състудент е бъдещият 14-ти президент на САЩ – Франклин Пърс.

От списания и вестници. Сред приятелите му е Джон О'Съливан, редактор на „Демократически преглед“. Първият роман на Хоторн, ''„Фаншоу“'' е публикуван анонимно на разноски на автора през 1828. В него се разказва за студентския живот в един колеж. Този роман не се радва на интерес от читателската аудитория и писателят изгаря останалите непродадени бройки. Покрай издаването на „Фаншоу“, обаче, Хоторн завързва приятелство със Самюел Гудрич от Бостън, издател на популярното ''„Американско списание за полезни и забавни знания“''. Хоторн става сътрудник на списанието, като пише предимно разкази и книжки за деца. През 1837 г. са публикувани неговите ''„Приказки, разказани повторно“'' – книга, високо оценена от Едгар Алън По. 

През трансценденталистите от Конкорд – Ралф Уолдо Емерсън и Хенри Дейвид Торо. Но Хоторн изпитва недоверие към интелектуалците и артистите. Той смята, че трансценденталистите гледат прекалено оптимистично на живота и забравят, че човешката природа има и своите тъмни страни. През 1842 Хоторн се жени за София Пибоди – активна участничка в трансценденталисткото движение. Поради растящото семейство и невъзможността да изкарва прехраната си като писател, Хоторн започва работа като чиновник към пристанището на Салем. След три години е уволнен. ''„Мразя този град“'' казва Хоторн за Салем, ''„мразя да излизам по улиците му и да се срещам с хората му“''.

През XVII век, когато пуританизмът в Америка е в разцвета си. Строгото пуританско общество осъжда на изолация съгрешилата Естер. Младата жена е принудена да носи алена буква „П“ (прелюбодейка), пришита върху роклята на гърдите и&#768;. Естер обаче приема унижението си с достойнство. Тя живее скромно, възпитава дъщеря си в християнски добродетели и помага на бедните и болните. С годините значението на позорната буква се заличава от съзнанието на съгражданите и&#768;, дъщерята се омъжва за европейски благородник, а възрастната Естер е уважавана и търсена за съвет от млади и стари. Днес образът на Естер се счита за първия образ на феминистка – класически пример на сексуално независима жена и смела алтернатива на Ана Каренина. Влиянието на ''„Алената буква“'' се усеща в редица по-късни произведения от американски автори, като например ''„Портрет на една дама“'' на Хенри Джеймс, ''„Пробуждането“'' на Кейт Шопен, ''„Както лежах и умирах“ (As I Lay Dying)'' на Уилям Фокнър.

На следващата година след публикуването на ''„Алената буква“'' излиза и ''„Къщата със седемте фронтона“'' (The House of the Seven Gables). В основата на историята, разказана в нея, е легендата за проклятието, отправено към рода на самия Хоторн от една жена, осъдена на смърт като вещица по време на съдебните процеси в Салем от края на 17-ти век. Проклятието носи нещастия на обитателите на голямата къща. Накрая един от потомците на убитата жена се оженва за младо момиче от прокълнатия род и така слага край на наследствения грях.

'''Nathaniel Hawthorne''' (born '''Nathaniel Hathorne'''; American novelist and short story writer.

He was born as Nathaniel Hathorne in 1804 in Fanshawe'', in 1828. He published several short stories in various periodicals which he collected in 1837 as ''Sophia Peabody. He worked at a Transcendentalist Utopian community before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. ''The Scarlet Letter'' was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to The Wayside in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, leaving behind his wife and their three children.

Much of Hawthorne's writing centers around allegories with a Romantic movement and, more specifically, dark romanticism. His themes often center on the inherent evil and sin of humanity and his works often have moral messages and deep psychological complexity. In addition to novels and short stories, he also wrote a biography of his friend Franklin Pierce.

There he became an important member of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and held many political positions including magistrate and judge, becoming infamous for his harsh sentencing.<ref>Miller, 20–21</ref> William's son John Hathorne was one of the judges who oversaw the Salem Witch Trials. Having learned about this, the author may have added the "w" to his surname in his early twenties, shortly after graduating from college, in an effort to dissociate himself from his notorious forebears.<ref>McFarland, 18</ref> Hawthorne's father, Nathaniel Hathorne, Sr., was a sea captain who died in 1808 of yellow fever in Suriname.<ref>Wineapple, Brenda.

In the summer of 1816, the family lived as boarders with farmers<ref>Mellow, 20</ref> before moving to a home recently built by Hawthorne's uncles Richard and Robert Manning in Raymond, Maine near Sebago Lake specifically for the family.<ref>Miller, 50</ref> Years later, Hawthorne looked back at his time in Maine fondly: "Those were delightful days, for that part of the country was wild then, with only scattered clearings, and nine tenths of it primeval woods".<ref>Mellow, 21</ref> In 1819, he was sent back to Salem for school and soon complained of homesickness and being too far from his mother and sisters.<ref>Mellow, 22</ref> For fun, he distributed to his family seven issues of ''The Spectator'' in August and September 1820. The homemade newspaper was written by hand and included essays, poems, and news utilizing the young author's developing adolescent humor.<ref>Miller, 57</ref>

Hawthorne's uncle Robert Manning insisted, despite Hawthorne's protests, that the boy attend college. On the way to Bowdoin College, at the stage stop in Portland, Hawthorne met future president Franklin Pierce. The two became fast friends.<ref>Edwards, Herbert. "[http://www.hawthorneassoc.com/html/downeast_mag.html Nathaniel Hawthorne in Maine]", 'Downeast Magazine', 1962</ref> With the financial support of his uncle Hawthorne attended Bowdoin, partly because of family connections in the area, from 1821 to 1825.<ref>Wineapple, Brenda. "Nathaniel Hawthorne 1804-1864: A Brief Biography", collected in ''A Historical Guide to Nathaniel Hawthorne'', Larry J. Reynolds, editor. Oxford University Press, 2001: 16. ISBN 0195124146.</ref> There, he also met the future poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, future congressman Jonathan Cilley, and future naval reformer Horatio Bridge.<ref>Cheever, 99</ref>  Years after his graduation with the class of 1825, he would describe his college experience to Richard Henry Stoddard: 

===Early career===
Hawthorne was offered an appointment as weigher and gauger at the Boston Custom House at a salary of $1,500 a year, which he accepted on January 17, 1837.<ref>Miller, 169</ref> During his time there, he rented a room from George Stillman Hillard, business partner of Charles Sumner.<ref>Mellow, 169</ref> Hawthorne wrote in the comparative obscurity of what he called his "owl's nest" in the family home. As he looked back on this period of his life, he wrote: "I have not lived, but only dreamed about living".<ref>Letter to Longfellow, June 4, 1837.</ref> He contributed short stories, including "Young Goodman Brown" and "The Minister's Black Veil", to various magazines and annuals, though none drew major attention to the author. Horatio Bridge offered to cover the risk of collecting these stories in the spring of 1837 into one volume, ''Twice-Told Tales'', which made Hawthorne known locally.<ref>McFarland, 22–23</ref>

===Marriage===
thumb|left|Salem Custom-House where Hawthorne worked
While at Bowdoin, Hawthorne had bet his friend Jonathan Cilley a bottle of transcendentalist Sophia Peabody. Seeking a possible home for himself and Sophia, he joined the transcendentalist Utopian community at Brook Farm in 1841 not because he agreed with the experiment but because it helped him save money to marry Sophia.<ref>McFarland, 83</ref> He paid a $1,000 deposit and was put in charge of shoveling the hill of manure referred to as "the Gold Mine".<ref>Cheever, 104</ref> He left later that year, though his Brook Farm adventure would prove an inspiration for his novel ''The Blithedale Romance''.<ref>McFarland, 149</ref> After three years of engagement, Hawthorne married Sophia Peabody on July 9, 1842,<ref>Wineapple, Brenda. "Nathaniel Hawthorne 1804-1864: A Brief Biography", ''A Historical Guide to Nathaniel Hawthorne'', Larry J. Reynolds, ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001: 24. ISBN 0195124146.</ref> at a ceremony in the Peabody parlor.<ref>Cheever, 108</ref> The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts,<ref>McFarland, 25</ref> where they lived for three years. There he wrote most of the tales collected in ''Mosses from an Old Manse''.<ref>Miller, 246–247</ref>

Like Hawthorne, Sophia was a reclusive person. Throughout her early life, she had frequent migraines and underwent several experimental medical treatments.<ref>Mellow, 6–7</ref> She was mostly bedridden until her sister introduced her to Hawthorne, after which her headaches seem to have abated. The Hawthornes enjoyed a long marriage, often taking walks in the park. Of his wife, who he referred to as his "Dove", Hawthorne wrote that she "is, in the strictest sense, my sole companion; and I need no other—there is no vacancy in my mind, any more than in my heart... Thank God that I suffice for her boundless heart!"<ref>McFarland, 87</ref> Sophia greatly admired her husband's work. In one of her journals, she writes: "I am always so dazzled and bewildered with the richness, the depth, the... jewels of beauty in his productions that I am always looking forward to a second reading where I can ponder and muse and fully take in the miraculous wealth of thoughts".<ref>January 14, 1851, Journal of Sophia Hawthorne. Berg Collection NY Public Library.</ref>

Nathaniel and Sophia Hawthorne had three children. Their first, a daughter, was born Julian was born. Hawthorne wrote to his sister Louisa on Rose, was born in May 1851. Hawthorne called her "my autumnal flower".<ref>Miller, 343–344</ref>

===Middle years===
In April 1846, Hawthorne was officially appointed as the "Surveyor for the District of Salem and Beverly and Inspector of the Revenue for the Port of Salem" at an annual salary of $1,200.<ref>Miller, 242</ref> He had difficulty writing during this period, as he admitted to Longfellow: "I am trying to resume my pen... Whenever I sit alone, or walk alone, I find myself dreaming about stories, as of old; but these forenoons in the Custom House undo all that the afternoons and evenings have done. I should be happier if I could write".<ref>Miller, 265</ref> Like his earlier appointment to the custom house in Boston, this employment was vulnerable to the politics of the spoils system. A Democrat, Hawthorne lost this job due to the change of administration in Washington after the presidential election of 1848. Hawthorne wrote a letter of protest to the ''Boston Daily Advertiser'' which was attacked by the Whigs and supported by the Democrats, making Hawthorne's dismissal a much-talked about event in New England.<ref>Cheever, 179</ref> Hawthorne was deeply affected by the death of his mother shortly thereafter in late July, calling it, "the darkest hour I ever lived".<ref>Cheever, 180</ref> Hawthorne was appointed the corresponding secretary of the Salem Lyceum in 1848. Guests that came to speak that season included Emerson, Thoreau, Louis Agassiz and Theodore Parker.<ref>Miller, 264–265</ref>

Hawthorne returned to writing and published ''The House of the Seven Gables'' (1851), which poet and critic James Russell Lowell said was better than ''The Scarlet Letter'' and called "the most valuable contribution to New England history that has been made"<ref>Mellow, 368–369</ref> and ''The Blithedale Romance'' (1852), his only work written in the first person,<ref>McFarland, 149</ref> followed in quick succession. He also published in 1851 a collection of short stories retelling myths, ''A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys'', a book he had been thinking about writing since 1846.<ref>Miller, 345</ref>

Hawthorne and his family moved to a small red farmhouse near Lenox, Massachusetts at the end of March 1850.<ref>Miller, 274</ref> Hawthorne became friends with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. and Herman Melville beginning on August 5, 1850, when the authors met at a picnic hosted by a mutual friend.<ref>Cheever, 174</ref></blockquote> Melville had just read Hawthorne's short story collection ''Mosses from an Old Manse'', and his unsigned review of the collection, titled "Hawthorne and His Mosses", was printed in the ''Literary World'' on August 17 and August 24.<ref>Miller, 312</ref> Melville, who was composing ''Moby-Dick'' at the time, wrote that these stories revealed a dark side to Hawthorne, "shrouded in blackness, ten times black".<ref>Mellow, 335</ref> Melville dedicated ''Moby-Dick'' (1851) to Hawthorne: "In token of my admiration for his genius, this book is inscribed to Nathaniel Hawthorne."<ref>Mellow, 382</ref>

===Later years===

In 1852, the Hawthornes returned to Concord. In February, they bought The Hillside, a home previously inhabited by consul in Liverpool shortly after the publication of ''Tanglewood Tales''.<ref>McFarland, 186</ref> The role, considered the most lucrative foreign service position at the time, was described by Hawthorne's wife as "second in dignity to the Embassy in London".<ref>Mellow, 415</ref> In 1857, his appointment ended and the Hawthorne family toured France and Italy. During his time in Italy, the previously clean-shaven Hawthorne grew a bushy mustache.<ref>McFarland, 210</ref>

The family returned to The Wayside in 1860,<ref>McFarland, 206</ref> and that year saw the publication of ''White Mountains with Pierce. Pierce sent a The Bells of Lynn".<ref>Wagenknecht, Edward. ''Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: Portrait of an American Humanist''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1966: 9.</ref> Hawthorne was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord, Massachusetts. After their respective deaths, wife Sophia and daughter Una were originally buried in England. However, in June 2006, they were re-interred in plots adjacent to Hawthorne.<ref>Mishra, Raja and Sally Heaney.

===Literary style and themes===
Hawthorne is best known today for his many short stories (he called them "tales") and his four major romances written between 1850 and 1860: ''The House of the Seven Gables'' (1851), ''Fanshawe'' was published anonymously in 1828. Hawthorne defined a romance as being radically different from a novel by not being concerned with the possible or probable course of ordinary experience.<ref>Porte, 95</ref> Many of his works are inspired by Puritan New England.<ref>Bell, Michael Davitt.
