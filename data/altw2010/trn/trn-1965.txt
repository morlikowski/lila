'''The Pretenders''' sind eine britische Rockband, welche nach dem Song ''The Great Pretender'' von The Platters benannt wurde.

== Geschichte ==
The Pretenders wurden 1978 von Chrissie Hynde gegründet. Die Anfangsbesetzung bestand aus Hynde, James Honeyman-Scott, Pete Farndon und Gerry Mackleduff. Letzterer wurde sehr bald durch Martin Chambers ersetzt.

Die erste veröffentlichte Single, ''Stop Your Sobbing'', war ein Cover. Sie wurde von Nick Lowe produziert und erreichte, ebenso wie die zweite Single ''Kid'', Platz 33 der britischen Charts vor.<ref name="everyhit"/> Die dritte Single ''Brass In Pocket'' schaffte es 1979 bis auf Platz 1.<ref name="everyhit"/> Ende 1979 spielten die Pretenders bei den ''Concerts for the People of Kampuchea''.

Im Januar 1980 erschien das USA gut verkaufte und von der Kritik sehr gelobt wurde:

Das namenlose zweite Album von 1981 sowie die Singles ''Talk Of The Town'', ''Message Of Love'' und ''I Go To Sleep'' hatten ähnliche Erfolge. Auf einer USA-Tournee im selben Jahr verletzte sich Chambers eine Hand, im Dezember die andere, weshalb viele Konzerte abgesagt werden mussten.

Am 14. Juli 1982 wurde Farndon von der Band gefeuert, zwei Tage später starb Honeyman-Scott an einer Überdosis Robbie McIntosh. Farndon starb im April 1983.

Anfang 1983 kam die Single ''Back On The Chain Gang'' auf den Markt, die Honeyman-Scott gewidmet ist<ref name="swr3"/> und den Sprung auf Platz 17 in Großbritannien schaffte.<ref name="everyhit"/> Ende des Jahres wurde ''2000 Miles'' veröffentlicht, das auf der LP ''Learning To Crawl'' (1984) zu hören war. Auch dieser Song wurde zu Ehren von Honeyman-Scott geschrieben<ref name="swr3"/> und schaffte es ebenfalls in die Top 20.<ref name="everyhit"/> Als Singles wurden weiterhin ''Middle Of The Road'' und ''Show Me'' ausgekoppelt. 1985 wirkten die Pretenders bei Live Aid mit.

Auf der von Jimmy Iovine produzierten 1986er LP ''Get Close'' spielten außer Hynde und McIntosh T.M. Stevens (Bass) und Blair Cunningham (Schlagzeug). Als Singles erschienen ''Don’t Get Me Wrong'', ''Hymn To Her'' und ''If There Was A Man'' (nicht aus dem Album, sondern dem 1987er James Bond-Film ''Der Hauch des Todes'').

'''The Pretenders''' are an Anglo-American rock band.  The original band consisted of group founder and main lead vocals, backing vocals, keyboards), backing vocals), and drums, backing vocals, percussion). The band was fractured by drug-related deaths and numerous subsequent personnel changes have taken place over the years, with Hynde as the sole constant member.

==History==
===Early years===

Hynde, originally from Akron, Ohio, United States, attended Firestone High School and later Kent State University at the time of the Kent State shootings in 1970. Hynde moved to London in 1973, dated the English rock critic Nick Kent, and from there began writing for the weekly music paper, ''New Musical Express''. After several years of false starts, including the bands Masters of the Backside and The Moors Murderers, she moved definitively from writing to performing. 

The Pretenders formed during the tail end of the original British punk movement, in 1978. Hynde's eventual band comprised a set of acquaintances from Welsh border — young players with a pop aesthetic who had missed out on the punk explosion of 1976, but were eager to catch up. 

Farndon (who was romantically linked with Hynde) was the first to join Hynde's band, following a medium-noteworthy run with the Bushwackers, an Australian folk-rock ensemble. Farndon then recruited guitarist Honeyman-Scott, at the time working in the guitar room at Buzz Music in Hereford.  However, the Pretenders had no official drummer even as late as the recording session for their first single ("Stop Your Sobbing"), which featured drumming by session player Gerry Mackleduff. Finally, Honeyman-Scott recruited Chambers, who was at the time working as a driving instructor only a few blocks from where Hynde was living.

===Original band (1978–1982)===

Following their 1978 signing to Real Records on the basis of a demo of the song "The Phone Call", the band quickly rose to critical attention with the January 1979 single, "Stop Your Sobbing", written in 1964 by Ray Davies and produced by Nick Lowe. It was followed in quick succession that year by the popular singles "Kid" in June and "Brass in Pocket" in November, which cracked the American market for the band (reaching #14 on the Billboard Hot 100). 

thumb|left|300px|The Pretenders (original line-up), Dominion Theatre, London, December 1981The debut album ''Pretenders'' was released in January 1980, and was a great success in both the United Kingdom and the United States, both critically and with chart-topping sales. (''Pretenders'' was subsequently named one of the best albums of all time by Heatwave festival in August 1980 near Toronto.

That the Pretenders were led by a hard-rocking woman was no small factor in their early breakthrough. With her trademark dark bangs, dark eyeliner, and dark jeans, Hynde appealed to both genders. And due to, as the 1983 ''Rolling Stone Record Guide'' would say, "her sheer authenticity as a three-dimensional woman whose sexuality is completely in sync with a superb rock sensibility," she was able to escape many of the clichéd roles of women in rock music.

Hynde's Chris Thomas (famed, with engineer Bill Price, for the sound achieved on the Sex Pistols' album, ''Never Mind the Bollocks''). Fans familiar with the band's U.S. chart singles are often unaware of how loud and aggressive the early Pretenders could be, and how loose and experimental some of their early recordings were.    

In March 1981 the EP ''Extended Play'' was released, a holding action containing the UK and U.S. hits "Message of Love" and "Talk of the Town" and a live version of "Precious," recorded in Central Park. 

The second full-length album, ''album-radio tracks "The Adultress," "Birds of Paradise," and "The English Roses."  According to Hynde from the Songwriters Circle, "Talk of the Town" is a song about a fan who just hung around during the sound checks and never said a word.  Chrissie never initiated any conversation, but thought about him later in the tour.   

At this early peak of the band's success and potential, Hynde kicked ex-lover Pete Farndon out of the group for ongoing drug problems.  Two days later, 16 June 1982, Honeyman-Scott was dead of a cocaine overdose.  While the band tried to regroup in the following year, Farndon overdosed on heroin and died on 14 April 1983.  Honeyman-Scott is now regarded as an important rock guitarist, while Farndon is widely admired as a rock bassist.

===Pretenders carry on (1983–1987)===

Hynde subsequently decided to continue with the band.  In July of 1983, a caretaker line-up of Hynde, Chambers, Billy Bremner and Tony Butler, was assembled to record a comeback single, the death-haunted "Back on the Chain Gang."  The song was released in October and marked a new level of musical sophistication for the band.  The single's flip-side, "My City Was Gone," in which Hynde expressed dismay at industrial pollution and rampant commercial development in her home state, was equally strong though; it's now perhaps best known as the theme music of ''The Rush Limbaugh Show''.  

Hynde then reformed The Pretenders, keeping Chambers and adding professional musicians Robbie McIntosh on guitar and Malcolm Foster on bass. The band's first album with this lineup, ''Learning to Crawl'', was released to respectful critical acclaim in January 1984. 

"Middle of the Road" was this lineup's first single, released in December, 1983.  Recapturing some of the group's earlier hard-edged sound, the song dealt with, among other things, Hynde's new motherhood (Hynde had a daughter with The Persuaders' "Thin Line Between Love and Hate."  The subsequent tour (with an added keyboard player) successfully showcased a tight band centered around Martin Chambers's forceful drumming. The 1985 Live Aid charity concert was the last gig for this lineup.

Shortly after recording sessions for the next album began and one track had been completed, Hynde declared that Chambers was no longer playing well and dismissed him — allegedly by booking new recording time without telling Chambers about it.  Foster was also let go, and after an appropriate interval, the newly-revised Pretenders lineup was officially announced as Hynde, McIntosh, bassist T.M. Stevens, and drummer Blair Cunningham.  In reality, though, the ''Get Close'' album was largely the work of Hynde, McIntosh, and a bevy of session musicians.

''Get Close'' was released in 1986; the disc included the singles "Don't Get Me Wrong" (helped by a popular video homage to the television series ''The Avengers'') and "Hymn to Her" (a #8 hit in the UK).  The song "John Barry in several fight scenes.

The lineup for the ''Get Close'' tour was then expanded to include keyboardist Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr joined for a final brief period in 1987. By this time, it was evident that the Pretenders were a band in name only, the name merely serving as a vehicle for Chrissie Hynde.
