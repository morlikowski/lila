La '''République d’Ossétie-du-Sud''' [en République de Géorgie. Cette république n'est pas reconnue par l'ONU. Sa capitale est Tskhinvali et son président est Edouard Kokoïty (depuis le 18 décembre 2001). L'Ossétie-du-Sud est située à la frontière avec la Russie qui ne la reconnait pas mais qui continue à maintenir des relations et récemment, à reforcer ses liens.<ref>[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/100/article_65137.asp Moscou reforce ses liens avec l'Abkhazie et l'Ossétie du Sud]</ref> 

== Histoire ==
L'URSS créa la ''région autonome d'Ossétie-du-Sud'' le , territoire d'une superficie de 3900 km², qui  était alors peuplée de 99&nbsp;400 habitants, et qui fut inclus au sein de la ''République socialiste soviétique de Géorgie''. 

Depuis l'indépendance de la Géorgie vis-à-vis de l'URSS le 9 avril 1991, l'autonomie accordée aux Ossètes a été supprimée par l'État géorgien, provoquant l'exode de la population vers la république d'Ossétie du Nord. L'essentiel de son territoire constituant désormais la partie nord de la région de Shida Kartli.

En 1994, les nationalistes ont proclamé l'indépendance de l'Ossétie du Sud, profitant de la faiblesse du nouvel État géorgien. Ce nouvel État s'est rapproché de la République d'Ossétie du Nord, une des Républiques de la Fédération de Russie, avec laquelle elle a une frontière, une culture et des relations économiques communes.

Depuis le retour d'un pouvoir nationaliste à président géorgien OTAN. Les indépendantistes d'Ossétie du Sud souhaitent également une réunification avec l'Ossétie du Nord, mais ni la Fédération de Russie, ni l'OSCE et encore moins la Géorgie ne soutiennent cette solution.

La République d'Ossétie-du-Sud a tenu un deuxième référendum sur son indépendance le 12 novembre 2006 (le premier référendum de 1992 n'a pas été reconnu au niveau international). Une très large majorité des votants semblent s'être prononcés pour cette indépendance. Le gouvernement géorgien, les États-Unis et l'Union européenne considèrent ce référendum comme illégal alors que la Russie le reconnait.

In 2007, Dmitri Sanakoev became the head of the Provisional Administration of South Ossetia.

On July 13, 2007, Georgia set up a state commission, chaired by the Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli, to develop South Ossetia's autonomous status within the Georgian state. According to the Georgian officials, the status will be elaborated within the framework of "an all-inclusive dialogue" with all the forces and communities within the Ossetian society.<ref>[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=15431 Commission to Work on S.Ossetia Status].

==History==
===Medieval and early modern period===
The Don river in present-day Russia and part migrated towards and over the Caucasus mountains, to Georgia<ref> David Marshall Lang, The Georgians, New York, p. 239 </ref> where they formed three distinct territorial entities. Digor in the west came under the influence of the neighboring Kabard people, who introduced Islam. Tualläg in the south became what is now South Ossetia, part of the historical Georgian principality of Samachablo<ref>Roger Rosen, History of Caucasus Nations, London, 2006 </ref> where Ossetians found refuge from Mongol invaders. Iron in the north became what is now North Ossetia, under Russian rule from 1767. Most Ossetians are now Christian (approximately 61%); there is also a significant Muslim minority.

===South Ossetia under Russia and the Soviet Union===
The modern-day South Ossetia was annexed by Russia in 1801, along with Georgia proper, and absorbed into the series of Ossetian rebellions during which claims for independence were made. Georgian government accused Ossetians of cooperating with Bolsheviks. According to Ossetian sources about 5,000 Ossetians were killed and more than 13,000 subsequently died from hunger and epidemics.<ref name=icg>International Crisis Group, [http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=3128&l=1 Georgia: Avoiding War in South Ossetia], 26.11.2006</ref>

===Georgian-Ossetian conflict===

250px|thumb|left|South Ossetia detailed map
The tensions in the region began to rise amid the rising nationalism among both Georgians and Ossetians in 1989. Prior to this, the two communities of the 1918-1920 events. Both ethnicities have had a high level of interaction and high rates of intermarriages.

Influential South Ossetian Popular Front (''Ademon Nykhas'') was created in 1988. On 10 November 1989 South Ossetian regional council asked the Georgian Supreme Soviet for the region to be upgraded to autonomous republic. In 1989 the Georgian Supreme Soviet established Georgian as the principal language countrywide.<ref name=icg/>

The Georgian Supreme Soviet adopted a law barring regional parties in summer 1990. This was interpreted by Ossetians as a move against Ademon Nykhas and led to Ossetians proclaiming South Ossetia a Soviet Democratic Republic<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972214,00.html Hastening The End of the Empire], ''TIME Magazine'', January 28, 1991</ref>, fully sovereign within the USSR. Ossetians boycotted subsequent Georgian parliamentary elections and held their own contest in December. The Georgian government headed by Zviad Gamsakhurdia declared this election illegitimate and abolished South Ossetia's autonomous status altogether on 11 December, 1990.<ref name=icg/>

Violent conflict broke out towards the end of 1991 during which many South Ossetian villages were attacked and burned down as well as Georgian houses and schools in Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia. As a result, approximately 1,000 died and about 100,000 ethnic Ossetians fled the territory and Georgia proper, most across the border into North Ossetia. A further 23,000 ethnic Georgians fled South Ossetia and settled in other parts of Georgia.<ref> Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, [http://hrw.org/reports/1996/Russia.htm RUSSIA. THE INGUSH-OSSETIAN CONFLICT IN THE PRIGORODNYI REGION], May 1996.</ref> Many South Ossetians were resettled in uninhabited areas of North Ossetia from which the Ingush had been expelled by Stalin in 1944, leading to conflicts between Ossetians and Ingush over the right of residence in former Ingush territory.

At the time of the recognized as legitimate the pre-Baltic SSRs, but regarded the questions related to the independence and territorial conflicts of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and the rest of the Transcaucasus — which were integral part of the USSR with international borders unaltered since the 1920s — as internal Soviet affairs.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973116,00.html America Abroad], ''TIME Magazine'', June 10, 1991</ref>

In 1992, Georgia was forced to accept a ceasefire to avoid a large scale confrontation with Russia. The government of Georgia and South Ossetian separatists reached an agreement to avoid the use of force against one another, and Georgia pledged not to impose sanctions against South Ossetia. However, the Georgian government still retains control over substantial portions of South Ossetia, including the town of Georgia spy row have damaged its credibility as a neutral peacekeeper in the EU's Black Sea neighbourhood."<ref>[http://euobserver.com/24/22622 ''Russia 'not neutral' in Black Sea conflict, EU says''], EUobserver, October 10 2006.</ref>

==Politics==
The Republic of South Ossetia consists of a checkerboard of Georgian-inhabited and Ossetian-inhabited towns and villages. The largely Ossetian capital city of Tskhinvali and most of the other Ossetian-inhabited communities are governed by the separatist government, while the Georgian-inhabited villages and towns are administered by the Georgian government. This close proximity and the intermixing of the two communities has made the conflict in South Ossetia particularly dangerous, since any attempt to create an ethnically pure territory would involve population transfers on a large scale.

The political dispute has yet to be resolved and the South Ossetian separatist authorities govern the region with effective independence from Tbilisi. Although talks have been held periodically between the two sides, little progress was made under the government of Eduard Shevardnadze (1993–2003). His successor Mikheil Saakashvili (elected 2004) made the reassertion of Georgian governmental authority a political priority. Having successfully put an end to the ''de facto'' independence of the southwestern province of Ajaria in May 2004, he pledged to seek a similar solution in South Ossetia. After the 2004 clashes, the Georgian government has intensified its efforts to bring the problem to international attention. On January 25 2005, President Saakashvili presented a Georgian vision for resolving the South Ossetian conflict at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) session in Strasbourg. Late in October, the U.S. Government and the OSCE expressed their support to the Georgian action plan presented by Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli at the OSCE Permanent Council at Vienna on October 27, 2005. On December 6, the OSCE Ministerial Council in Ljubljana adopted a resolution supporting the Georgian peace plan <ref>OSCE, 13th Meeting of the Ministerial Council (5 and 6 December 2005).

The People of South Ossetia for Peace was founded in October of 2006 by the ethnic Ossetians who were outspoken critics and presented a serious opposition to secessionist authorities of Eduard Kokoity. 

The group headed by the former defence minister and then prime minister of secessionist government Dmitri Sanakoev organized the so-called alternative presidential election, on November 12 2006– parallel to those held by the secessionist authorities in Tskhinvali.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> High voter turnout was reported by the alternative electoral commission, which estimated over 42,000 voters from both Ossetian (Java district and Tskhinvali) and Georgian (Eredvi, Tamarasheni, etc) communities of South Ossetia and Sanakoev reportedly received 96% of the votes. Another referendum was organised shortly after asking for the start of negotiations with Georgia on a federal arrangement for South Ossetia received 94% support. However the Salvation Union of South Ossetia turned down a request from a Georgian NGO, “Multinational Georgia”, to monitor it and the released results were very likely to be inflated.<ref name=icg2007>[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=4887&l=1 Georgia’s South Ossetia Conflict: Make Haste Slowly], Europe Report N°183, 7 June 2007 (free registration needed to view full report)</ref>

According to International Crisis Group "Georgian government’s steps are non-violent and development-oriented but their implementation is unilateral and so assertive that they are contributing to a perceptible and dangerous rise in tensions". <ref name=icg2007/>   

Initially the entity of Sanakoev was known as "the Alternative Government of South Ossetia", but during the course of 2007 the central authorities of Georgia decided to give it official status and on April 13 the formation of "Provisional Administration of South Ossetia" was announced. <ref>[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=14944 Online Magazine - Civil Georgia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On May 10, 2007 Dmitry Sanakoev was appointed head of the provisional administrative entity in South Ossetia. <ref name="autogenerated3" />
