'''夏洛特堡宫'''（德文：Schloss Charlottenburg）是德国柏林现存最大的宫殿。它座落于夏洛特堡和威尔默斯多夫大区下辖的夏洛特堡区。

<!--==历史==
Initially, under the name of ''Lietzenburg'', the palace was constructed in the Italian Baroque style by the architect Friedrich III, Elector of Brandenburg. After Friedrich's coronation in 1701 as King Friedrich I of Prussia and Charlotte his Queen,  the palace, which was initially conceived as a summer retreat from Berlin (''Sommerhaus'') was expanded by the architect Eosander von Göthe into a magnificent building. After the death of his wife in 1705, Friedrich named the Schloss and the accompanying estate ''Charlottenburg'' in her memory. From 1709 to 1712 further building expansion was carried out, during which the characteristic turrets and the orangery appeared.

Inside the Charlottenburg Palace used to be what was described as "the eighth wonder of the world" — the ''Bernsteinzimmer'', a room with its walls surfaced in decorative Königsberg, where Gottfried Wolffram, Ernst Schacht and Gottfried Turau prepared the plans in 1701-09. The room was executed under the suprevision of Andreas Schlüter.

After the death of Friedrich I in 1713 Charlottenburg entered a new existence under its next owner, King Friedrich Wilhelm I. He gave the Amber Room in 1716 to Peter the Great as a present. Yet right after his death in 1740, the newly crowned King Friedrich II allowed Charlottenburg to be expanded by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, whereupon east of the palace rose the New Wing. Subsequently, Friedrich's interest in Charlottenburg was extinguished in favour of the Schloss Sanssouci at Potsdam (completed by 1747).

The palace was in its best finished form under Friedrich Wilhelm II with the completion of the western palace theatre and the small orangery of Carl Gotthard Langhans.

The grounds were laid out at the end of the 17th century by Simeon Godeau in the French style of André Le Notre, and at the end of the 18th century part of the parterre was transformed partly into an English landscape garden. In the palace grounds can be found the 1788 ''Belvedere teahouse'' by Carl Gotthard Langhans, the 1824/25 Neapolitan villa styled ''New Pavillion'' and the 1810 mausoleum built for Queen Luise.

==History== 
===Palace===
The original palace was commissioned by Friedrich III, baroque style.  It consisted of one wing and was built in 2½ storeys with a central Corinthian pilasters.  On the top was a cornice on which were statues.  At the rear in the centre of the palace were two oval halls, the upper one being a ceremonial hall and the lower giving access to the gardens. Nering died during the construction of the palace and the work was completed by Martin Grünberg and Andreas Schlüter.  The inauguration of the palace was celebrated on 11 July 1699, Frederick's 42nd birthday.<ref>Hertzsch, pp. 7–8.</ref>

Friedrich crowned himself as King Freidrich I of Prussia in 1701.  Two years previously he had appointed Fortune designed by Andreas Heidt.  In 1704 a free-standing stairway was built, a novelty in the country at that time, which was described by Friedrich as "the finest ornament in the entire house".<ref>Hertzsch, pp. 8–12.</ref>

Inside the palace was a room described as "the eighth wonder of the world", the Peter the Great as a present in 1716.<ref></ref>

When Friedrich I died in 1713 he was succeeded by his son, Friedrich Wilhelm I whose building plans were less ambitious, although he did ensure that the building was properly maintained. building was resumed after his son, Friedrich II (Frederick the Great), came to the throne in 1740. During that year stables for his personal guard regiment were completed to the south of the Orangery wing and work was started on the east wing.  The building of the new wing was supervised by Elisabeth Christine, who, preferring Schönhausen Palace, was only an occasional visitor.  The decoration of the upper floor, which included the White Hall, the Banqueting Hall, the Throne Room and the Golden Gallery, was lavish and was designed mainly by Johann August Nahl.  In 1747 a second apartment for the king was prepared in the distant eastern part of the wing.  During this time Sanssouci was being built at Potsdam and once this was completed Frederick was only an occasional visitor to Charlottenburg.<ref>Hertzsch. pp. 19–21.</ref>

In 1786 Frederick was succeeded by his nephew Friedrich Wilhelm II who transformed five rooms on the ground floor of the east wing into his summer quarters and part of the upper floor into Winter Chambers, although he did not live long enough to use them.  His son, Friedrich Wilhelm III came to the throne in 1797 and reigned with his wife, Queen Luise for 43 years.  They spent much of this time living in the east wing of Charlottenburg.  Their eldest son, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, who reigned from 1840 to 1861, lived in the upper storey of the central palace building.  After Friedrich Wilhelm IV died, the only other royal resident of the palace was Friedrich III who reigned for 99 days in 1888.<ref>Hertzsch, pp. 22–26.</ref>

The palace was badly damaged in 1943 during the Second World War.<ref></ref>  In 1951 the war-damaged Stadtschloss in East Berlin was demolished and, as the damage to Charlottenburg was at least as serious, it was feared that it would also be demolished.  However following the efforts of Margarete Kühn, the Director of the State Palaces and Gardens, it was rebuilt to its former condition.<ref>Hertzsch, p. 26.</ref> From 2004 until early 2006, Charlottenburg Palace was the seat of the President of Germany, whilst Schloss Bellevue was being renovated.

The garden was designed in 1697 in baroque style by Simeon Godeau who had been influenced by English landscape style for Friedrich Wilhelm II, the work being directed by Peter Joseph Lenné.  After the Second World War the garden was restored to its previous baroque style.<ref>Hertzsch, pp. 13–17.</ref>
