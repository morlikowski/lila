== Overview ==
thumb|NSDAP election poster from 1932

The July 31 elections of 1932 in Germany are arguably some of the most pivotal in history. In the July 31 election the Nazi party gained great strength by winning a large number of seats in the Reichstag (Congress) and became the largest political party in Germany. These elections, like all of history, are a product of previous events. Therefore, in order to understand the July 31, 1932 German elections the preceding months and years must first be examined.

== Background ==
In the nineteen twenties and thirties the world was in the midst of the Great Depression and Germany was no different.  Between 1929 and 1932 unemployment went from eight and a half percent to nearly thirty percent <ref>The Holocaust Chronicle PROLOGUE: Roots of the Holocaust. 2002.</ref> In the same period industrial production inside Germany dropped roughly forty two percent <ref>The Holocaust Chronicle PROLOGUE: Roots of the Holocaust. 2002.</ref> This was the economic backdrop that allowed the Nazi party to double its membership between 1928 and 1930 <ref>The Holocaust Chronicle PROLOGUE: Roots of the Holocaust. 2002.</ref> In this period the Weimar Republic (the pre-Nazi government) was increasingly weakened and more power was exponentially bestowed upon the offices of the President and the Chancellor. The economic crisis and the failures of the Weimar Republic conspired to allow the Nazi party to rise to power.

==1932 March & April Presidential Elections ==

The July, 1932 elections could be said to have begun as early as February of that year.  February is the month that Adolf Hitler became a German citizen in order to run for the presidency in the March election <ref>The Holocaust Chronicle PROLOGUE: Roots of the Holocaust. 2002.</ref>. Of the four candidates in that election Hitler managed to place second behind the incumbent President Hindenburg. The election system in place required a candidate to win a majority of the vote and due to Hindenburg's failure to do so a runoff election was held one month later <ref>The Holocaust Chronicle PROLOGUE: Roots of the Holocaust. 2002.</ref>.  The resulting April election saw Hindenburg successfully elected <ref>The Holocaust Chronicle PROLOGUE: Roots of the Holocaust. 2002.</ref>. The average German citizen had already lost much confidence in the government and two presidential elections in two months only added to frustration. Flaws in the Weimar Republic's system such as its presidential election process added to the Nazi Party’s goal of becoming the only party in Germany.

== Two Chancellors and four elections ==

After Adolf Hitler’s loss in the presidential election the successful domination of the Nazi party seemed far less likely to some. However, those at the seat of German power still feared a Nazi controlled Germany. It was these fears that lead German Chancellor Bruening to order President Hindenberg to ban the Nazi SA and SS wings of the party only four days after the runoff election of mid-April 1932 <ref>Trotsky, Leon. The Rise of Hitler and Destruction of the German Left. 12 February 2008.</ref>. This ban was intended to further injure the Nazi party. Chancellor Bruening would come to realize his decision to ban the SA and SS would have the opposite of the desired effect. Instead of injuring the Nazi party the ban solidified its core. The Nazi party continued its rise to power despite the efforts of Chancellor Bruening. At the end of May 1932 due to continuing political upheaval President Hindenberg demanded the resignation of Chancellor Bruening <ref>Trotsky, Leon. The Rise of Hitler and Destruction of the German Left. 12 February 2008.</ref> The flaws of the Weimar Republic again became obvious to the German people do to Bruenings resignation. Between March thirteenth and May thirty-first of 1932 Germany had two presidential elections and a forced resignation of the chancellor. The failure of the government inspired a near total lack of confidence in the government and left people seeking other alternatives. The Nazi party was banking on this lack of confidence to come to power.
