The '''36th Spanish island of Mallorca.

==Chess competition==
Both tournament sections were officiated by international arbiter Swiss system; the open division was played over four boards per round, whilst the women's was played over three.  The time control for each game permitted each player 90 minutes to make all of his or her moves, with an additional 30 seconds devolving on each player after each move, beginning with the first.  

===Open tournament===
The open division was contested by 129 teams representing 125 nations and territories; International Braille Chess Association and the International Physically Disabled Chess Association each provided one squad.

Led by first board Grandmaster (''GM'') rated player at the tournament, who recorded nine-and-one-half points over 13 rounds, and second reserve ''GM'' draw only to American ''GM'' seed, having brought four of the tournament's nine highest-rated players, and as defending champions.

Georgia, tied Russia's 36.5 points; Armenia were placed after Russia, though, on the Buchholz tiebreak system employed by the Olympiad, and finished, as in the 35th Chess Olympiad, with the bronze medal.  

Cuba, seeded 18th, and Bulgaria, seeded 20th, each finished in the top ten, led respectively by second board ''GM'' Lazaro Bruzon (eight points over 11 games) and first board ''GM'' Kiril Georgiev (eight points in 13 games, including a final round defeat of the tournament's top rated player, Indian ''GM'' Viswanathan Anand), while France, seeded 12th, and England, seeded eighth, performed below expectations, finishing in 23rd and 30th, respectively.

====Team results====
The teams finishing first through third overall receive medals, as do those finishing in the top three amongst teams organized by seed; overall medal winners are not eligible to receive group prizes.

====Individual results====
Individual medals are awarded to the three players to achieve the best [http://www.fide.com/ratings/calculator_rp.phtml rating performance] having played at least eight games.  Medals are also awarded to the top three finishers, by percentage of points won from total points possible, from amongst those to have played primarily on each of boards one through four (having played at least eight games) as well as to those reserves who have otherwise played at least seven games across all boards, who are classified as playing on boards five and six.  Teams typically feature their better players on the lower-numbered boards, but illness, fatigue, and absence often affect playing rotations.  Ties are resolved in favor of the player who played more games; where ties remain, the player with a better rating performance is awarded the superior placing.

===Women's tournament===
The women's division was contested by 87 teams representing 84 nations and territories; International Braille Chess Association and the International Physically Disabled Chess Association each entered one squad.

''GM'' Georgia, whilst the United States defeated Slovakia and then scored a 2½-½ victory of Hungary, drawing, along with Georgia, to within three points of China with two rounds remaining.  China, though, defeated sixth-seeded Vera Menchik Trophy.  

Second-seeded tiebreaks. 

Thirteenth-seeded Hungary, paced by second board ''IM'' Szidonia Vajda, who recorded two wins and a draw against three players ranked in the top seven of those participating, and 27th-seeded England, for whom ''IM'' Harriet Hunt scored nine-and-one-half points in 13 games, finished a surprising sixth and eighth respectively, while Ukraine, the fifth-seeded team, tallied only eight points in 19 games played by first board ''WGM'' Natalia Zhukova and fourth board ''IM'' Olga Alexandrova, ultimately finishing in 18th place.   

====Team results====
