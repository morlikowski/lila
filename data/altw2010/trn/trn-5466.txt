==Inventions, discoveries, introductions==
*Maya inscriptions; some other Yucatán generally used an abbreviated form known as the Short Count. See Miller and Taube (1993, p.50); Voss (2006, p.138).</ref> &mdash;the ''b'ak'tun''-cycle consisting of thirteen b'ak'tuns of 144,000 days each&mdash; was projected back to an earlier, mythical date. This date is equivalent to 11 August 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar (or 6 September in the proleptic Julian calendar), using the correlation known as the "Goodman-Martinéz-Thompson (GMT) correlation". The GMT-correlation is worked out with the Long Count starting date equivalent to the Julian Day Number (JDN) equal to 584283, and is accepted by most Mayanist scholars as providing the best fit with the ethnohistorical data.<ref name="autogenerated1">See survey by Finley (2002).</ref> Two succeeding dates, the 12th and 13th of August (Gregorian) have also been supported, with the 13th (JDN = 584285, the "astronomical" or "Lounsbury" correlation) attracting significant support as according better with astronomical observational data.<ref> After a modified proposal championed by Floyd Lounsbury; sources which have used this 584285 correlation include Houston (1989, p.51), and in particular Schele and Freidel (1990, pp.430 ''et seq.''). See also commentary by Finley (2002), who although making an assessment that the "[584285 correlation] is now more popular with Mayanists", expresses a personal preference for the 584283 correlation.</ref> Although it is still contended which of these three dates forms the actual starting base of the Long Count, the correlation to one of this triad of dates is definitively accepted by almost all contemporary Mayanists. All other earlier or later correlation proposals are now discounted.<ref name="autogenerated1" />
