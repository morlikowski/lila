'''Supervulkan''' (''Supervolcano'') ist eine Mischung aus 2005 produziert wurde.

== Handlung ==

Geologen des Magmakammer befindet, die tausende Male größer ist, als jene des Mount St. Helens bei dessen Ausbruch im Jahr 1980.

Alle Szenarien deuten daraufhin, dass ein Ausbruch des Yellowstone bevorsteht, der die Welt binnen weniger Tage zerstören und alles Leben darauf ausradieren wird.

Doch niemand glaubt Rick Lieberman und seinem Team, selbst die Heimatschutzministerin Wendy Reiss nicht. Eines Tages - im Film ist es gerade Juni - bricht der Supervulkan aus.

Die Folgen sind verheerend, als man registriert, dass das Magma nicht an einer sondern gleich an mehreren Stellen ausbricht. Die USA befinden sich am Rande ihrer Vernichtung.

== Hintergrundinformationen == 

Gedreht wurde in London, am „Originalschauplatz“ im Yellowstone-Nationalpark (Wyoming) und im kanadischen Vancouver.

'''''Supervolcano''''' is a 2005 BBC/Discovery Channel docudrama centered on the fictional eruption of the volcanic caldera of Yellowstone National Park.

==Plot==
The film begins with a group of hooded people in caribou parkas riding through the snow on Yamaha snowmobiles. Arriving at a nearly buried building, inside they find a video recorded journal of a man who appears to be dying. The man in the video reports that the Yellowstone caldera eruption has affected nearly everything in the United States, burying much of the country under several feet of volcanic ash.

The film then goes back five years to before the incident, where tourists are seen viewing hydrovolcanic features of the Yellowstone National Park. Inside the visitor's centre, the same man from the video journal, Rick Lieberman, a USGS scientist in charge of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (Y.V.O), is seen presenting to a crowd on Yellowstone's seismic activity. He states during the presentation, using a fictional holographic projector known as ''Virgil'', that Yellowstone is on the verge of an eruption, though neither major nor hazardous.

Later throughout the film, more and more signs of seismic activity occur, all indicating towards the imminent eruption of Yellowstone (such as geyser explosions, earthquakes, tsunamis and Old Faithful going silent), though Rick and most of his colleagues try not to cause public panic by saying that these seismic activities do not necessarily indicate an imminent volcanic eruption. However, media speculation raises public alarm, helped in part by Rick Lieberman's brother-in-law, who is selling a book on supervolcanoes called 'Super Bangs'. As seismic activity increases, a leaked government e-mail acknowledging a possible eruption causes widespread panic.

Rick's team is caught by surprise while researching at the USGS field office next to Yellowstone when the volcano violently erupts, spewing tonnes of rock and pyroclastic material into the sky. Two of his colleagues, Nancy and Matt are killed as a result of attempting to outrun the pyroclastic flow, and only an injured Jock survives the eruption, escaping via helicopter. Rick is away at a conference and is caught in the ash cloud as he returns.

Tension begins to rise at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (F.E.M.A.) as more and more vents open above the underlying magma chamber throughout the week long eruption. On Day 3 the ash destroys the second Y.V.O. base in Bozeman, killing another colleague, Dave. People are literally being drowned in the volcanic ash and the death toll rises to hundreds of thousands. Slowly, thermal images begin to reveal a contour of the new caldera produced by the vents and authorities begin to realise the seriousness of this problem. Very soon, the authorities become desperate, trying to find a way to save the trapped Americans in the central and western half of the country. At F.E.M.A. Jock raises tension by saying that even after 2,500 cubic km of magma had come out, that it could still go on because Yellowstone has a maximum capacity of 25,000 cubic kilometers, ten times the amount already ejected. And Rick, while in contact with F.E.M.A. mentions that the entire caldera could explode after the collapse. Luckily, things take a better turn just as all hope is nearly lost; the caldera collapses upon itself, indicating the decrease in pressure within the magma chamber, and it doesn't explode.
