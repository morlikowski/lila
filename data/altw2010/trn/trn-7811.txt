'''Andrew Hill''' (American jazz pianist and composer. 

==Life and career==
Born in Haitian-born parents<ref>"Sam Rivers Trio + Andrew Hill Quartet at the Iridium Jazz Club Oct. 8-13" Oct. 10, 2002 http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=1879</ref>, although early biographical information incorrectly identified his birthplace as Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
<ref name ="NYTIMES">Ratliff, Ben. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/arts/21hill.html "Andrew Hill, 75, Jazz Artist Known for His Daring Style, Dies"], Bill Russo to Paul Hindemith, with whom he studied informally until 1952. While a teenager he performed in rhythm and blues bands and with touring jazz musicians, including Charlie Parker and Miles Davis. 

Hill first recorded as a sideman in 1954, but his reputation was made by his Blue Note recordings as leader from 1963 to 1970, which featured several other important John Gilmore.  Hill also played on albums by Henderson, Hutcherson, and Dialogue'' album.

Hill rarely worked as a sideman after the 1960s, preferring to play his own compositions. This may have limited his public exposure.  He obtained a doctorate in music from Hamilton and served as the university's composer in residence from 1970 to 1972. He later taught in California and at Portland State University before returning to New York City in 1990.

In May 2007, he became the first person to receive a posthumous honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music.

==Style==
Hill created a unique idiom that utilized chromatic, modal, and occasionally "free" improvisation. Although usually categorized as "avant-garde", Hill's music bears little resemblance to the free atonality and extended improvisations of Cecil Taylor and others. Like his contemporaries Joe Henderson, Wayne Shorter, and Eric Dolphy, Hill was considered to be a cusp figure: too "out" to be "in," but too "in" to be "out." His earlier work, particularly the album ''Point of Departure'', featuring fellow innovator Eric Dolphy, exhibits Hill's desire to advance while remaining grounded in the traditions of his predecessors. Throughout, his skill as both composer and leader can be sensed as the band ventures into unknown territory while still remaining precise and controlled. Hill's compositions sometimes have a contemplative mood. He was known for the rhythmic and harmonic complexity of his performances and compositions.

As a pianist, Hill's style was marked by extreme chromaticism, complex, dense chords, flowing, legato phrasing, and frequent rubato. He would often play against the rhythmic pulse, or move into different time signatures.
