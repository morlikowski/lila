'''Xe tăng T&nbsp;&ndash; 34''' là Tiger của Đức. Thiết kế của T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 đã phối hợp được những phát triển từ cả của người Mỹ và cả người Đức. Năm 1931, người Nga mua hai chiếc xe tăng Christie của Mỹ. Hệ thống treo của chiếc Christie được hợp nhất vào xe T&nbsp;&ndash; 34. Thông thường, nó được lắp động cơ diesel kiểu chữ V 500 sức ngựa được phát triển từ động cơ diesel của BMW.

Nguyên mẫu đầu tiên của T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 được hoàn thành vào đầu năm 1939. Tháng 9 năm 1940, T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 được đưa vào sản xuất và được trang bị pháo 76 mm. T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 được đưa vào sử dụng trước khi những thử nghiệm chính thức được hoàn thành. Nó được chế tạo tại nhiều nhà máy khác nhau và số lượng T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 được sản xuất là lớn nhất so với tất cả các loại tăng khác trong Chiến tranh thế giới thứ hai.

T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 là loại tăng rất tù túng, nó bị đánh giá kém về mức độ tiện nghi cho kíp chiến đấu bốn người. T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 cũng bị coi là quá ồn và có thể bị phát hiện từ khoảng cách 450 đến 500m, vì vậy lính Đức có được những cảnh báo sớm về vị trí của  xe. Giá trị cao nhất của T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 là sự thiết kế đơn giản giúp việc chế tạo rất dễ dàng và dễ sửa chữa. Trong chiến tranh thế giới thứ hai đã ghi nhận nhiều trường hợp xe tăng T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 bị bắn bay mất tháp pháo đã dễ đàng được sửa chữa trong điều kiện dã chiến, lắp tháp pháo mới và lại tham gia chiến đấu. Xe cũng khá nhẹ và động cơ làm mát bằng nước làm tăng độ tin cậy của động cơ cũng như tăng khoảng cách hoạt động của xe. Tốc độ của T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 cũng là một lợi thế chính yếu so với các xe tăng Đức: Tốc độ tối đa trung bình của các xe tăng Đức là 25 dặm (khảng 40 km)/giờ trong khi tốc độ tối đa của T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 là 32 dặm (khoảng 50 km)/giờ. Vỏ thép nghiêng cũng giúp cho T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 có được sự bảo vệ tốt chống lại đạn pháo Đức.

Ưu điểm lớn nhất của xe T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 chính là tính rất dễ sản xuất của nó: Liên Xô có thể chịu đựng được mức tổn thất lớn của T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 trên chiến trường vì hệ thống nhà máy của họ cho phép sản xuất ra rất nhanh hàng nghìn chiếc khác. Trong khi các nhà máy của Đức bị quân đồng minh ném bom, các nhà máy T&nbsp;&ndash; 34 nằm sâu sau dãy Ural nơi không bị ảnh hưởng của các cuộc ném bom của không quân Đức và có thể tăng công suất sản xuất hỗ trợ cho nhau để bù cho số bị thiếu hụt khi một nhà máy gặp vấn đề. Do không quân Đồng Minh ném bom phá hủy rất nhiều nhà máy quân sự của Đức từ năm 1942 nên số thời gian phía Đức cần để sản xuất 1 xe tăng Tiger thì phía Liên Xô có thể sản xuất 7-8 xe T&nbsp;&ndash; 34. Dó đó trong chiến trận phía Đức phải tiêu diệt được 7-8 xe tăng Nga với mức tổn thất 1 xe tăng Tiger của mình thì mới có cơ hội thay đổi được so sánh lực lượng có lợi về phía mình, tỷ lệ này phía Đức không thể nào có thể đạt được. Thành phố Cheliabinsk (''Челябинск'') tại vùng núi Ural Nga là nơi sản xuất chính loại xe tăng này nhiều đến nỗi thành phố này được gọi là Tankograd (''танкоград'')&nbsp;&ndash; thành phố xe tăng.

The '''T-34''' was a Soviet medium tank produced from 1941 to 1958. It is widely regarded to have been the world's best armour and armament were surpassed by later tanks of the era, it is credited as the war's most effective, efficient and influential design.<ref>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/t34.htm Achtung Panzer! - T-34 !<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> First produced at the KhPZ factory in Kharkov (Ukraine), it was the mainstay of Soviet armoured forces throughout World War II, and widely exported afterwards. It was the most-produced tank of the war, and the second most-produced tank of all time, after its successor, the T-54/55 series.<ref>Harrison 2002.</ref> A 1996 publication showed that the T-34 was still in service with twenty-seven countries.

The T-34 was developed from the BT series of fast tanks, and was intended to replace both the BT-5 and BT-7 tanks and the Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:66, 111). At its introduction, it was the tank with the best balanced attributes of firepower, mobility, and protection in existence, although initially its battlefield effectiveness suffered from the unsatisfactory ergonomic layout of its crew compartment, lack of radios and poor tactical employment. The two-man turret crew arrangement required the commander to also serve as the gunner, an arrangement common to most Soviet tanks of the day; this proved to be inferior to the German arrangement of three men (commander, gunner and loader).

The design and construction of the tank were continuously refined during the war to improve effectiveness and decrease costs, allowing steadily greater numbers of tanks to be fielded. In early 1944, the improved T-34-85 was introduced, with a more powerful 85&nbsp;mm gun and a three-man turret design. By the war's end in 1945, the versatile and cost-effective T-34 had replaced many light and Soviet tank production. Its evolutionary development would lead directly to the T-54/55 series of tanks, built until 1981 and still operated today.

==Production history ==
===Revolutionary design===
: ''"We had nothing comparable."'' —(1956)
Before 1939, the most numerous Soviet tanks were the BT series of fast tanks. The T-26 was a slow-moving 37&nbsp;mm anti-tank guns, and their gasoline-fueled engines (commonly used in tank designs in the world at these times) were liable to burst into flames "at the slightest provocation" (Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:111). Both were Soviet developments of foreign designs from the early 1930s: the T-26 based on the British Vickers 6-Ton, and the BT tanks based on a design from American engineer Walter Christie.

In 1937, engineer armour, a 45&nbsp;mm (1.8&nbsp;in) gun, and the new model V-2 engine, using less-flammable Zheltov 1999). This feature had greatly saved on maintenance and repair of the unreliable tank track of the early 1930s, and allowed tanks to travel over 85 km/h (53&nbsp;mph) on roads, but gave no advantage in combat. By then, the designers considered it a needless waste of space and weight (Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:66, 111). The A-20 also incorporated previous research (BT-IS and BT-SW-2 projects) into sloped armour: its all-round sloped armour plates would be more likely to deflect anti-armour rounds than perpendicular armour.<ref>Yaziv, D.; Chocron, S.; Anderson, Jr., C.E.; Grosch, D.J.. "Oblique Penetration in Ceramic Targets". Proceedings of the 19th International Symposium on Ballistics IBS 2001, Interlaken, Switzerland, 1257–1264</ref>

Koshkin convinced Soviet leader Leningrad team, but the project was plagued by technical problems and political shake-ups. About 69 Zaloga 1984:114)</ref> The second prototype Koshkin named A-32, after its  of frontal armour. It also had a 76.2&nbsp;mm (3&nbsp;in) gun, and the same model V-2 diesel engine (Zaloga 1994:5). Both were tested in field trials at Zaloga 1994:6).

Two prototype T-34s were completed in January 1940, and underwent a gruelling 2,000-kilometre (1,250&nbsp;mi) drive from Kremlin leaders, to the Zaloga 1994:6). Some drivetrain shortcomings were identified and corrected (Zaloga & Grandsen 1983:6). Resistance from the military command and concerns about high production cost were finally overridden by anxieties about the poor performance of Soviet tanks in Finland and the effectiveness of Germany's Blitzkrieg in France, and the first production tanks were completed in September 1940, completely replacing the production of the T-26, BT, and the multi-turreted Alexander Morozov, was appointed Chief Designer.

The T-34 had the coil-spring Christie suspension of the BT, but dispensed with the weighty but ineffective convertible drive. It had well-sloped armour, a relatively powerful engine, and wide tracks. The initial version had a 76.2&nbsp;mm gun, and is often called T-34/76 (originally a World War II German designation). In 1944 a second major version began production, the T-34-85 (or T-34/85), with a larger turret mounting a larger 85&nbsp;mm gun.

===Establishing and maintaining production===

The T-34 posed new challenges for Soviet industry. It was the most heavily armoured medium tank produced to that point, and subassemblies originated at several plants: Gorky. There were problems with defective armour plates, however (Zaloga 1983:6). Due to a shortage of new V-2 diesel engines, the initial production run from the Gorky factory were equipped with the BT tank's transmission and Zheltov 2001:40–42). Only company commanders' tanks could be fitted with radios; such radios were expensive and in short supply. The L-11 gun did not live up to expectations, so the Grabin design bureau at F-34 76.2&nbsp;mm gun. No bureaucrat would approve production, so Gorky and KhPZ started producing the gun anyway; official permission only came from Stalin's State Defence Committee after troops in the field sent back praise for the gun's performance (Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:130).

There was political pressure from conservative elements in the army to redirect resources into building the older T-26 and BT tanks, or to cancel T-34 production pending completion of the more advanced T-34M design. This political pressure was brought to bear by the developer of the KV-1 and IS-2 tanks which were in competition with the T-34. Political pressure between designers and factories producing different tanks to meet the same requirements continued much later post war, including a period when the T-55, T-64 and T-72 were all in production at different factories with differing political patrons on the supreme council of the USSR (Armour Magazine, "Why Three Tanks" July-August 1998).  Germany's surprise attack against the Soviet Union in June 22 1941 (Operation Barbarossa) forced the Soviet Union to freeze further development, and shift into full production of tanks.

Germany's fast advances forced the monumental evacuation of tank factories to the Ordzhonikidze Ural Heavy Machine Tool Works (UZTM) in Sverdlovsk absorbed several small factories. While these factories were relocating at record speed, the industrial complex surrounding the Stalingrad Tractor Factory produced forty percent of all T-34s (Zaloga & Grandsen 1983:13). As the factory became surrounded by heavy fighting in the Zaloga & Sarson 1994:23). Stalingrad kept up production until September 1942.

thumb|The T-34's 12-cylinder Model V-2 [[diesel engine, at the Finnish Tank Museum in Parola]]
Barring this interruption, the only changes allowed on the production lines were to make the tanks simpler and cheaper to produce. New methods were developed for automated hardening the plate, including innovations by Prof. (Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:131). Over two years, the production cost of the tank was reduced from 269,500 rubles in 1941, to 193,000, and then to 135,000 (Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:131). Production time was cut in half by the end of 1942, even though most experienced factory workers had been sent to the field and replaced by a workforce consisting of 50% women, 15% boys, and 15% invalids and old men. At the same time T-34s, which had been "beautifully crafted machines with excellent exterior finish comparable or superior to those in Western Europe or America", were much more roughly finished, although mechanical reliability was not compromised (Zaloga & Grandsen 1983:17).

===Development===
: ''"The technological pace-setter of World War II tank design"'' —(1997:3)

In 1942, a new hexagonal turret design derived from the abandoned T-34M project entered production, improving the cramped conditions, and eventually adding a commander's cupola for all-round vision. Limited rubber supplies led to the adoption of steel-rimmed road wheels, and a new clutch was added to the improved five-speed transmission and engine.

After German tanks with the superior long 75&nbsp;mm (2.95&nbsp;in) gun were fielded in 1942, Morozov's design bureau began a project to design an advanced T-43, aimed at increasing armour protection, while adding modern features like Zaloga et al 1997:5)

In 1943 the Soviets encountered the new German Tiger and Panther tanks. Experience at the 85 mm (3.3&nbsp;in) antiaircraft gun was identified which was effective against the new German tanks, and could be adapted to tank use (Russian Battlefield 1998b). Unfortunately, the T-43 prototype's heavier armour was still not proof against the Tiger's 88&nbsp;mm gun, and its mobility was found to be inferior to the T-34's, even before installing a heavier 85&nbsp;mm gun. Although it shared over 70% of its components with the T-34, a commitment to manufacturing it would have required a significant slow-down in production. (Zaloga et al 1997:5) thumb|left|The [[T-43 (tank)|T-43 (right), next to a T-34 Model 1943]] In consequence the T-43 was cancelled, and the Soviet command made the difficult decision to retool the factories to produce a new model of T-34 with a turret ring enlarged from 1,425 mm (56 in) to 1,600 mm (63 in), allowing a larger turret to be fitted. The T-43's turret design was hurriedly adapted by V. Kerichev at the Zaloga 1984:166). The resulting new T-34-85 tank had a much superior gun and finally, a three-man turret with radio (which had previously been in the hull). Now the commander needed only to command the tank, leaving the operation of the gun to the gunner and loader.

Overall production slowed down somewhat while the new tank started its production run. Although a T-34-85 was still not a match for a Panther, the improved firepower made it much more effective than before. The decision to improve on the existing design instead of tooling up for a new one allowed the Soviets to manufacture tanks in such numbers that the difference in capabilities could be considered insignificant. In May 1944, the Wehrmacht had only 304 Panthers operating on the Eastern Front, while the Soviets had increased T-34-85 production to 1,200 tanks per month (Zaloga et al 1997:6).

===Cost-effectiveness===
The cost to produce a T-34-85 tank was initially about thirty percent higher than a Model 1943, at 164,000 (Harrison 2002:181). During the course of the war, the cost of a T-34 tank had been reduced by almost half, while in the meantime its mobility remained nearly the same, and its main gun's armour penetration and turret frontal armour thickness nearly doubled.

===Production figures===
thumb|T-34-85 with Polish Army markings
By the end of 1945, over 57,000 T-34s had been built: 34,780 original T-34 tanks in 1940–44, and another 22,559 T-34-85s in 1944–45 (''The Russian Battlefield'' 1998a, 1998b). In 1946, after the war, 2,701 T-34s were built, and large-scale production ceased. Production was restarted under license in 1951 in Poland and Czechoslovakia, where 1,380 and 3,185 T-34-85s were made, respectively, by 1956. Later, T-54/55 and T-72 tanks were also built outside the Soviet Union. In the late 1960s, Soviet T-34-85s underwent a modernisation program (T-34-85M) for export and reserve service, being retrofitted with drivetrain components from the T-54/55 series tanks—a testament to the level of standardisation in Soviet tank design.

As many as 84,070 T-34s are estimated to have been built, plus 13,170 self-propelled guns built on the T-34's chassis (Zaloga & Grandsen 1996:18). Some of these ended up in various Cold War conflicts around the world.

====Model designations====
German intelligence in World War II referred to the two main production models as ''T-34/76'' and ''T-34/85'', with minor models receiving letter designations such as ''T-34/76A''—this nomenclature has been widely used in the West, especially in popular literature.

The Red Army never had a consistent policy for naming the production models (Zaloga 1994:19). Since at least the 1980s however, many academic sources (notably, AFV expert Steven Zaloga) have been using Soviet-style nomenclature: ''T-34'' and ''T-34-85'', with minor models distinguished by year, as ''T-34 Model 1940''. This system is used here.

Some Russian historians use different names: they refer to the first T-34 as the ''T-34 Model 1939'' instead of 1940, all T-34s with the original turret and F-34 gun as ''Model 1941'' instead of Models 1941 and 1942, and Zheltov 2001, passim).

Captured T-34s in German service were designated ''Panzerkampfwagen T-34(r)'', for ''Russland'' ('Russia'). 

The Finns called the T-34 ''Sotka'' after the Common Goldeneye, a sea duck, because the side silhouette of the tank resembles a swimming waterfowl (as related in the memoirs of Finnish tank ace Lauri Heino). The T-34-85 was called ''pitkäputkinen Sotka'', 'long-barreled Sotka'.

The '''T-34''' (German designation: T-34/76) was the original tank with 76.2 mm gun.

* '''Model 1940''' (T-34/76A) — Early production run with interim L-11 76.2 mm tank gun in a two-man turret
* '''Model 1941''' (T-34/76B) — Main production with heavier armour and the superior F-34 76.2 mm gun
* '''Model 1942''' (T-34/76C) — Many minor manufacturing improvements
* '''Model 1943''' (T-34/76D, E, and F) — New cast hexagonal turret, nicknamed "Mickey Mouse" by the Germans because of its appearance with the twin, round turret-roof hatches open. Main production had a new commander's cupola
* '''T-34/57''' — Fewer than 324 T-34s in 1941 and 1943–44 were fitted with the ZiS-4 or the ZIS-4M high-velocity 57 mm gun to be used as tank hunters (Wachowski 2004). Some of them took part in the Battle of Moscow

The '''T-34-85''' (T-34/85) was a major improvement with a three-man turret and long 85 mm gun.

* '''Model 1943''' — Short production run of February–March 1944 with D-5T 85 mm gun
* '''Model 1944''' — Main production, with simpler ZiS-S-53 85 mm gun, radio moved from the hull into a turret with improved layout and new gunner's sight

Various technical improvements continued to be made to the T-34-85, including major refurbishing programs in 1960 and 1969. All T-34-85 models are externally very similar.

Pre-war development of a more advanced T-34 tank was resumed in 1944, leading to the torsion-bar suspension and transversely-mounted engine. It had a lower profile than the T-34-85 and was simpler to manufacture. Between 150 to 200 of these tanks were built before the end of the war. With some drivetrain modifications and a new turret and gun, it became the T-54, starting production in 1947.

Czechoslovakian-built T-34-85s can be recognised by a semi-conical armoured fairing (like a rear-facing scoop) on the left rear slanting side panel of the engine compartment sponson. These were widely exported.

====Variants====

Identification of T-34 variants can be complicated. Turret castings, superficial details, and equipment differed between factories. New features were added in the middle of production runs or retrofitted to older tanks. Knocked-out tanks were rebuilt, sometimes with the addition of newer-model equipment and even new turrets. Some tanks also had Russian.

====Other T-34-based AFVs====
* '''Flame-thrower tanks''' — OT-34 and OT-34-85 were fitted with an internally mounted flame-thrower replacing the hull machine gun
* '''PT-34''' — Mine roller tank, mostly built on T-34 Model 1943 or T-34-85 chassis
* '''Self-propelled guns''' — The T-34 chassis was used as the basis for a series of self-propelled guns
** SU-122
** SU-85
** SU-100

After World War II, some T-34s were fitted with 122 mm howitzers as self-propelled artillery by Syria and Egypt.

====T-34-based support vehicles====
There were many support vehicles and even civilian tractors and cranes built on the T-34 chassis starting during the war and continuing at least into the 1990s. The vast majority of these were conversions of old or damaged tanks and self-propelled guns.

* '''Bridging tanks''' — Old tanks rebuilt in the field or at repair facilities. These were simply driven into water two abreast for special river-crossing operations, to be recovered later.
* '''Armoured recovery vehicles''' — During World War II, some old tanks were rebuilt as armoured recovery vehicles (ARVs), by plating over the turret ring or adding a superstructure. After the war, this repurposing program was formalized in successively more elaborate models.

The T-34 is often used as a symbol for the effectiveness of the Soviet (Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:127). The T-34 could take on all 1941 German tanks effectively. However, the new tank suffered from severe mechanical problems, especially with its transmission and clutch—at least fifty percent of the first summer's total tank losses were due to breakdowns rather than German fire, although this also included old tanks in disrepair (Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:127). There was a shortage of repair equipment, and it was not uncommon for early T-34s to go into combat carrying a spare transmission on the engine deck. The mechanical troubles were eventually sorted out.

During the winter of 1941–42, the T-34 again dominated German tanks through its ability to move over deep mud or snow without bogging down. German tanks could not move over the same terrain the T-34 could handle. The Panzer IV used an inferior leaf spring suspension and narrow track with a tendency to sink in deep mud and snow.<ref>Perrett 1999.</ref> The German infantry, at that time armed mostly with the PaK 36 37&nbsp;mm (1.46&nbsp;in) towed antitank gun, and had no effective means of stopping T-34s. During the Battle of France the Pak 36 had even earned the lovable nickname "Door Knocker" due to its inability to penetrate anything but the lightest tank armour, yet it worked very well at announcing the presence of the gun crew. Needless to say, crews of these weapons fighting on the Eastern front also found it severely underpowered for engaging enemy tanks, often having to rely on heavier towed firepower, such as the relatively rare but effective Pak 38 or newer and much heavier Pak 40 and especially the 88 mm Flak guns which could not be moved into location as easily. Only the poor level of Soviet crew training, the ineptitude of Soviet commanders, and the early distribution prevented the T-34 from achieving greater success.

The emphasis in the Red Army in 1942–43 was on rebuilding the losses of 1941 and improving tactical proficiency. T-34 production increased rapidly, but the design was "frozen"—generally, only improvements that sped production were adopted. Soviet designers were well aware of the need to correct certain deficiencies in the design, but these improvements would have cost production time and could not be adopted. By mid-1943 T-34 production was running at about 1,000 tanks per month, much higher than the German rate.<ref>[http://www.onwar.com/tanks/ussr/data/t3476m43.htm T-34-76 Model 1943<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Soviet losses greatly exceeded German losses due to continued tactical inferiority.
