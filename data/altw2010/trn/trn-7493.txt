Il '''piano di Fano''' (dal matematico italiano Gino Fano) è il piano proiettivo costruito sullo spazio lineare '''Z'''<sub>''2''</sub><sup>2</sup>, vale a dire il più piccolo piano proiettivo non banale costruibile.
È composto dai 7 punti di coordinate omogenee:
:(0,0,1)
:(0,1,0)
:(1,0,0)
:(0,1,1)
:(1,0,1)
:(1,1,0)
:(1,1,1)
e da sette rette ed è pertanto una geometria finita.

Un modo diverso per descrivere il piano di Fano è partire dai seguenti assiomi:
# ogni retta del piano ha almeno tre punti
# per ogni punto del piano passano almeno tre rette
# per ogni coppia di punti passa una e una sola retta
# ogni coppia di rette si incontra in uno e un solo punto
# ogni retta del piano ha al massimo tre punti
# per ogni punto del piano passano al massimo tre rette
Gli ultimi due sono quelli che veramente determinano il piano di Fano.

Esiste una spazi proiettivi. In tale contesto si hanno i seguenti nomi per i punti: 

:P, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11

In finite geometry, the '''Fano plane''' (after Gino Fano) is the projective plane with the least number of points and lines: 7 each. 

==Geometry==

Perhaps the best way to view the plane is via linear algebra.  Using the standard construction via homogeneous coordinates, we can identify the points with the non-zero ordered triples of binary digits, i.e., excluding 000. This can be done in such a way that for every two points we can find the third point on the line through the two by adding modulo 2 in each position. In other words, the points of the Fano plane correspond to the non-zero points of the finite vector space ''F''<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> of dimension 3 over ''F''<sub>2</sub> , the finite field of order 2. 
A line in the Fano plane corresponds to a 2-dimensional subspace of ''F''<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>: the points ''a, b, c'' are collinear if and only if ''a + b = c'' (equivalently, ''b + c = a'', or ''c + a = b'').

This might be a bit simpler if we ignore the field structure of ''F''<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>.  Then the 7 points of the plane correspond to the 7 non-identity elements of the group (''Z''<sub>2</sub>)<sup>3</sup> = ''Z''<sub>2</sub> &times; ''Z''<sub>2</sub> &times; ''Z''<sub>2</sub>. The lines, i.e. the collinear triples, correspond to the subgroups of order 4, i.e., those isomorphic to ''Z''<sub>2</sub> &times; ''Z''<sub>2</sub>.  The automorphism group of the group (''Z''<sub>2</sub>)<sup>3</sup> is that of the Fano plane (see below), and has order 168.

According to the general construction (Method 2) explained in the article on projective planes we have (with a slightly more compact notation) points ''P'', 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11 and the following lines:

:One line ''L'' = { ''P'', 0, 1}
:2 lines ''L''0 = {''P'', 00, 10}, ''L''1 = {''P'', 01, 11}
:4 lines ''L''00 = {0, 00, 01}, ''L''01 = {1, 00, 11}, ''L''10 = {0, 10, 11}, ''L''11 = {1, 10, 01}

An alternative naming is:
*points: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
*lines: {1,2,4},{2,3,5},{3,4,6},{4,5,7},{5,6,1},{6,7,2},{7,1,3}

The lines can be classified into four types.  On 3 lines the codes for the points have the 0 in a constant position (001 010 011, 001 100 101, 010 100 110).  On 3 lines the vectors have equal bits in two specific positions (001 110 111, 010 101 111, 100 011 111), and on one line the codes for the points all have exactly two bits equal to 1 (011 101 110).  (This classification does not correspond to interesting geometry but it can be interesting for coding theory.)

==Automorphism group and configurations== 
 
A permutation of the seven points that carries collinear points (points on the same line) to collinear points (in other words, it "preserves collinearity") is called a "collineation group (or automorphism group, or symmetry group) is of order 168: any ordered pair is automorphic to any other one, and in addition to choosing to which ordered pair one ordered pair is mapped, we can choose the image of one more point, not on the same line, so we get 7 &times; 6 &times; 4 = 168 possibilities. In other words, there are 168 ordered triples forming a triangle (28 triangles, with for each 6 permutations of the vertices), all isomorphic, and the image of one determines the images of the other 4 points. 

The collineation group is isomorphic to the projective special linear group PSL(2,7) = PSL(3,2), and the general linear group GL(3,2) (which are equal because the field has only one nonzero element). 

One out of every 30 permutations of the 7 points is an automorphism, so if we consider colorings of the 7 points of the Fano plane in 7 different given colors, up to isomorphism 30 different ones exist. 

The automorphism group is made up of 6 conjugacy classes, which we describe in terms of their permutations of the points:
*the identity,
*21 point permutations of type (12)(34) that keep all 3 points on one line fixed, and for one of these points, the other 2 lines through it; they interchange the other 4 points pairwise, and the other 4 lines ditto,
*56 point permutations of type (123)(456) that rotate one triangle (a cyclic permutation of the 3 vertices, and a corresponding cyclic permutation of the 3 other points on the sides, keeping the 7th point fixed; hence "rotations about a point"); in other words: keep one point fixed, and choose 3 other points on a line, carry out a cyclic permutation of the 3 points on the line, and a corresponding cyclic permutation of the 3 other points.
*42 point permutations of type (12)(3456) that keep one point fixed, interchange the other two points on one line through the fixed point, and perform a cyclic permutation of the remaining 4.
*two classes of point permutations of type (1234567) :
**24 with ''A'' mapped to ''B'', ''B'' to ''C'', ''C'' to the 3rd point on ''AB, ''D'' to 3rd point on ''BC'', etc. 
**24 with ''A'' mapped to ''B'', ''B'' to ''C'', ''C'' to the 3rd point on ''AC'', ''D'' to 3rd point on ''BD'', etc.
