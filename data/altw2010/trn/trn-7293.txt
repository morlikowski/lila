The current line-up including guitarist Steve Morse has been much more stable, though Lord's retirement in 2002 has left Paice as the only original member.<ref>[http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Ian_Paice2.html Drummerworld: Ian Paice<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==History==
===(1964&ndash;1968) Pre-Deep Purple years===
In 1967, former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis contacted London businessman Tony Edwards in the hope that he would manage a new group he was putting together, to be called '''Roundabout''': so-called because the members would get on and off the band, like a musical roundabout. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance the venture with two business partners: John Coletta and Ron Hire (Hire-Edwards-Coletta - HEC Enterprises).

The first recruit was the classically-trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord, who had most notably played with The Artwoods (led by Art Wood, brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and featuring Keef Hartley). He was followed by session guitarist Ritchie Blackmore who was persuaded to return from Hamburg to audition for the new group. Curtis soon dropped out, but HEC Enterprises, as well as Lord and Blackmore, were keen to carry on. 

For the bass guitar, Lord suggested his old friend The Flower Pot Men and their Garden (formerly known as '''The Ivy League''') back in 1967. Simper's claims to fame (apart from Purple) were that he had been in Johnny Kidd & The Pirates and had been in the car crash that killed Kidd. He was also in Screaming Lord Sutch's '''The Savages''', where he played with Blackmore.

The line-up was completed by singer Deep Purple, which was his grandmother's favourite song.

=== (1968&ndash;1970) Breakthrough ===

In October 1968, the group had success with a cover of Hush", which reached #4 on the US Billboard chart. The song was taken from their debut album ''Cream on their ''Goodbye'' tour. 

The band's second album, ''Deep Purple'', which contained strings and woodwind on one track ("April"). Several influences were in evidence, notably Bach and Rimsky-Korsakov.

After these three albums and extensive touring in the States, their American record company, Tetragrammaton, went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future. (Tetragrammaton's assets were assumed by Hair'', whom Rod Evans was trying to seduce, before Evans and Simper were fired.

The band hunted down singer Ian Gillan from Episode Six, a band that had released several singles in the UK without achieving their big break for commercial success. Six's drummer Mick Underwood - an old comrade of Blackmore's from his Savages days - made the introductions, and bassist Roger Glover tagged along for the initial sessions. Purple persuaded Glover to join full-time; an act that effectively killed Episode Six and gave Underwood a guilt complex that lasted nearly a decade - until Gillan recruited him for his new post-Purple band in the late 1970s.

This created the quintessential Deep Purple "Mark II" lineup, whose first, inauspicious release was a Greenaway-Cook tune titled "Hallelujah," which flopped. 

The band gained some much-needed publicity with the ''Gemini Suite'', another orchestra/group collaboration in the same vein, in late 1970.

=== (1970&ndash;1976) Popularity and breakup ===

Shortly after the orchestral release, the band began a hectic touring and recording schedule that was to see little respite for the next three years. Their first studio album of this period, released in mid-1970, was ''Deep Purple in Rock'' (a name deliberately chosen to distance the rock album from the concerto) and contained the then-concert staples "Speed King," "Into The Fire," and "Child in Time." The band also issued the UK Top Ten single "Black Night." The interplay between Blackmore's guitar and Lord's distorted organ, coupled with Ian Gillan's howling vocals and the rhythm section of Glover and Paice, now started to take on a unique identity and become instantly recognisable to rock fans throughout Europe.

A second album, the more mellow and creatively progressive ''Fireball'' (a favourite of Gillan but not of the rest of the band), was issued in the summer of 1971. The title track "Fireball" was released as a single, as was "Strange Kind of Woman" - not from the album but recorded during the same sessions (although it was included on the US version of the album in lieu of the UK version's song "Demon's Eye.")

Within weeks of ''Fireball'''s release, the band was already performing songs planned for the next album. One song (which later became "Machine Head''. The album was due to be recorded at a casino in Arthur Brown in person!" 

Continuing from where both previous albums left off, ''Machine Head'' has since become one of the band's most famous albums, including tracks that became live classics such as "Lazy," and "Made in Japan''. Originally intended as a Japan-only record, its world-wide release saw the double LP become an instant hit. It remains one of rock music's most popular and highest selling live-concert recordings (although at the time it was perhaps seen as less important, as only Glover and Paice turned up to mix it).

The classic Purple Mk. II line-up continued to work and released the album ''Trapeze. According to the liner notes for the 30th anniversary edition of Burn, after first acquiring Glenn Hughes, they debated continuing as a four piece with Hughes as both bassist and vocalist. This new line-up continued into 1974 with the heavier blues-rock album ''Burn'', another highly successful release and world tour. Hughes and Coverdale added both vocal harmonies and a more funky element to the band's music, a sound that was even more apparent on the late 1974 release ''Stormbringer.'' Besides the title track, the album had a number of songs that received much radio play, such as "Lady Double Dealer," "The Gypsy," and "Soldier Of Fortune." Yet Blackmore voiced unhappiness with the album and the direction Deep Purple had taken. As a result, he left the band in the spring of 1975 to form his own band with Elf, called Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, later shortened after one album to Rainbow.

With Blackmore's departure, Deep Purple was left to fill one of the biggest bandmember vacancies in rock music. In spite of this, the rest of the band refused to stop, and to the surprise of many long-time fans, actually announced a replacement for the "irreplaceable" Man in Black; American Tommy Bolin.
 
There are at least two versions about the recruitment of Bolin: according to the liner notes in the ''Deep Purple'' 4-CD boxed set it was Coverdale who had suggested auditioning Bolin. "He walked in, thin as a rake, his hair coloured green, yellow, and blue with feathers in it. Slinking along beside him was this stunning Hawaiian girl in a crochet dress with nothing on underneath. He plugged into four Marshall 100-watt stacks and...the job was his." But in an interview originally published by Melody Maker in June 1975 and available at the Deep Purple Appreciation Society's (DPAS) website, Bolin himself claimed that he came to the audition following a recommendation from Ritchie Blackmore [http://www.deep-purple.net/interviews/tommy-bolin.htm].  Bolin had been a member of many now-forgotten mid-60s bands - Denny & The Triumphs, American Standard, and Zephyr, which released three albums from '69-72. Before Purple, Bolin's best-known recordings were made as a session musician on Spectrum'', and on The Bang'' (1973) and ''Miami'' (1974). He had also jammed with such luminaries as Dr. John, Albert King, Teaser'' when he accepted the invitation to join Deep Purple.

The resulting album, ''Come Taste the Band'', was released in October 1975. Despite mixed reviews, the collection revitalised the band once again, bringing a new, extreme funk edge to their hard rock sound. Bolin's influence was crucial, and with encouragement from Glenn Hughes and David Coverdale, the guitarist developed much of the material. Later, Bolin's personal problems with drugs began to manifest themselves, and after cancelled shows and below-par concert performances, the band was in danger.

=== (1976&ndash;1984) Band split, side projects ===
The end came on tour in Britain in March 1976 at the Liverpool Empire Theatre. David Coverdale reportedly walked off in tears and handed in his resignation, to which he was allegedly told there was no band left to quit. The decision to disband Purple had been made some time before the last show by Lord and Paice (the last remaining original members), who hadn't told anyone else. The break-up was finally made public in July 1976. 

Later, Bolin had just finished recording his second solo album, ''Private Eyes'', when, on December 4, 1976, tragedy struck. In Miami, during a tour supporting Jeff Beck, Bolin was found unconscious by his girlfriend. Unable to wake him, she hurriedly called paramedics, but it was too late. The official cause of death: multiple-drug intoxication. He was 25 years old.

After the break-up most of the past and present members of Deep Purple went on to have considerable success in a number of other bands, including Rainbow, Whitesnake, Black Sabbath and Gillan. There were, however, a number of promoter-led attempts to get the band to reform, especially with the revival of the hard rock market in the late 70s/early 80s. By 1980, an unauthorised version of the band surfaced with Rod Evans as the only member who had ever been in Deep Purple, eventually ending in successful legal action from the legitimate Deep Purple camp over unauthorised use of the name. Evans was ordered to pay damages of $672,000 for using the band name without permission.<ref>[http://www.thehighwaystar.com/specials/1980/darkside.html Bogus Deep Purple]</ref>

===(1984&ndash;1994) Reunions and breakups ===
In April 1984, eight years after the demise of Deep Purple, a full-scale (and legal) reunion took place with the "classic" early 70s line-up of Blackmore, Gillan, Glover, Lord and Paice. The album ''Perfect Strangers'' was released in October 1984. A solid release, it sold extremely well and included  the singles and concert staples "Knockin' At Your Back Door" and "Perfect Strangers." The reunion tour followed, starting in Scorpions). The weather was bad, but 80,000 turned up anyway.
