'''Betfair''' er verdens desidert største veddemålsbørs.<ref>[http://www.racingtraders.com/How_Does_It_Work/What_Is_Betfair/ racingtraders.com: Betfair is the world's largest betting exchange]</ref> Selskapet holder til i Hammersmith i London, England.

==Bakgrunn==
Etter at Betfair ble lansert i juni 2000 har selskapet blitt den største internettbaserte bookmakeren i Storbritannia<ref>[http://www.na24.no/naeringsliv/article1552491.ece na24.no: Dette vedder vi mest på]</ref>, og verdens største veddemålsbørs. Betfair har (per desember 2007) 800,000 kunder, og en markedsverdi (i 2005) på 5.2 milliarder pund, omlag 55 milliarder norske kroner.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7109494.stm bbc.co.uk, 2007: How does a betting exchange work?].</ref>

En veddemålsbørs (gamblere mulighet til å tippe på odds gitt av andre gamblere istedenfor fra en bookmaker. En kan både kjøpe et resultat (back), og selge et resultat (lay). Når du «kjøper» et resultat (være seg en enkeltperson, et lag, en hest, en hund eller noe annet), vedder du på at resultatet slår til. Dette er akkurat som å spille hos en vanlig bookmaker. Når du selger et resultat (lay), vedder du på at det ikke slår til.<br /> Hvis du for eksempel spiller om hvilket fotballag som skal vinne toppserien i England, og du selger Tottenham, så tilbyr du odds til spillere som ønsker å vedde på at Tottenham vinner. Hvis Tottenham ikke vinner, innkasserer du kjøperens innsats. Hvis Tottenham vinner, må du derimot betale motparten gevinsten (akkurat som en bookmaker ville gjort).<ref>[http://content.betfair.com/aboutus/?product=exchange&region=GBR&locale=no&brand=betfair Betfair.com: Kjøp eller selg]</ref>
derivathandel, hvor 'back' og 'lay' tilsvarer kjøp og salg av derivater på børsen.

Betfair har fått en rekke utmerkelser, med ''Queen's Awards for Enterprise'' innenfor innovasjon som den mest prestisjetunge.<ref>[http://www.queensawards.org.uk/business/Winners/2003.html#innovation 2003 Innovation award winners]</ref> Queen's Awards er Storbritannias høyeste offisielle utmerkelse innenfor forretningslivet.

==Kontroverser==
Det faktum at gamblere kan selge (lay) et utfall har skapt storstilt kritikk fra tradisjonelle bookmakere, som Ladbrokes og William Hill,<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/racing-ladbrokes-chiefs-news-for-punters-at-least-one-race-every-day-is-fixed-565082.html independent.co.uk: Racing: Ladbrokes chief's news for punters: 'At least one race every day is fixed']</ref> som vektlegger at når anonyme personer kan vedde på at et resultat ikke slår til, kan det lett føre til svindel/korrupsjon, da det er mye lettere for eksempel å sørge for at en hest ''ikke'' vinner enn at en ''bestemt hest'' vinner. Betfair har forsvart seg med at konkurrentene argumenterer mer ut i fra egne kommersielle hensyn enn en generell bekymring for sportens integritet. Et annet argument Betfair har brukt er at til forskjell fra tradisjonelle bookmakere, som aksepterer anonyme veddemål, er Betfair kjent med sine kunders identitet på grunn av en omfattende registreringsprosess, samt at selskapet har tegnet avtaler med en del impliserte parter.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3767683.stm news.bbc.co.uk: Betfair signed an agreement with the Jockey Club, the racing regulator]</ref>

I 2007 suspenderte Betfair alle veddemål på en tenniskamp mellom Martin Arguello og Nikolaj Davydenko.<ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/other/article.html?in_article_id=59875 Sunday Metro: Betfair suspends betting on tennis clash]</ref>. Årsaken var mistenkelig store innsatser på at Nikolaj Davydenko skulle tape denne kampen, noe han forøvrig gjorde.

==Betfair utenfor Storbritannia==
Mesteparten av kundene til Betfair befinner seg på USA hvor online tipping i 2006 ble forbudt av Kongressen.<ref>[http://www.revenuesource.com/independent-programs/802-american-congress-approves-internet-gambling-ban-bill.html revenuesource: American congress approves internet gambling ban bill]</ref> Siden selskapet ikke har noen reelle konkurrenter innenfor sin nisje, har de hatt en føre-var holdning for å unngå å komme opp i trøbbel, ved å ikke etablere seg i land hvor Betfairs tjenester mest sannsynleg er forbudt. Til forskjell fra en del andre bookmakere med mye kunder i USA ble derfor ikke Betfair hardt rammet av dette forbudet.

'''Betfair''' is the world's largest betting exchange. The company is based in Hammersmith in West London, England.

Since Betfair was launched in UK and the largest clients and a turnover in excess of £50m/week.

A bet exchange allows punters (gamblers) to bet at odds set and requested by other punters rather than by a bookmaker. Members can make both 'Back' bets (normal bets on a selection to win) and 'Lay' bets (bets on the opposite side of the Back, against the selection), thereby eliminating the traditional bookmaker.

Betfair uses decimal odds, which are easier to calculate with than fractional odds. Its commission on all winning bets, which is set at 5% of the net winnings for most markets, although according to how much a client wagers on the site, it is possible to reduce the amount of commission paid to as low as 2%.

The Betfair interface can be seen as bearing a strong similarity to that of the derivatives.  Indeed there are many professionals who play the Betfair market for profit, using purpose-designed software, in much the same way as a trader.

The company has attracted much comment in the British and press.

==History==

Betfair's co-founders, Andrew Black and Edward Wray, won the Ernst and Young Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year award. In 2003, the company was one of about 50 recipients of the Queen's Awards for Enterprise in the ''Innovation'' category.<ref>
[http://www.queensawards.org.uk/business/Winners/2003.html#innovation 2003 Innovation award winners], retrieved on Oct 30, 2007.</ref>  The Queen's Awards are the UKs highest official awards for business.

In October 2005 chief executive Stephen Hill announced his resignation when the board decided not to proceed with plans for a stock market flotation, the investors holding out for a higher valuation.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2005/oct/15/gambling.uknews The Guardian: Chief of Betfair steps down as float is cancelled]</ref>

In Tasmanian government announced a deal to licence Betfair in the state. The deal will see Tasmania receive AU$5 million up front and is projected to pay Tasmania about $40 million per year. Now that it has been approved by the Tasmanian Parliament, it will be the second licence Betfair has received outside the UK - the first being in decision, found that two provisions of the legislation, purporting to ban Western Australians from using a betting exchange and prohibiting an unauthorised business from using Western Australian race lists, were invalid as they applied to Betfair because the provisions were characterised as imposing a burden on interstate trade that was protectionist in nature, and therefore contravened section 92 of the constitution.

On 28 February 2006 Betfair launched a new interface, including current live scores of in-play soccer matches, jockey silks and horse form, and an 'express view' in which only the currently available back odds are viewable. The changes were criticised on the Betfair forums by many members who disliked the smaller fonts and the right-aligned columns, which displayed a large amount of whitespace. On March 1 these display issues were addressed, although many users still felt the site had been dumbed down in order to attract new punters to the exchanges. The gambit worked, however, with a significant increase in membership and deposits during the Cheltenham Festival.

£1.5 billion. In December 2006, Betfair completed the purchase of the horseracing publishing company Timeform (which traded under the name Portway Press Ltd).

Betfair launched its own radio service, Betfair Radio, in March 2007 available via its website and on the telephone. Betfair Radio broadcasts horse racing commentary, results and sports news seven days a week from the studios at their headquarters in Hammersmith.

==Controversy ==
The fact that gamblers can now lay outcomes on the exchanges has caused tremendous criticism from traditional bookmakers with much of the anger coming from the UK's "Big Three" - Gala Coral Group, William Hill. These firms argue that granting who they consider to be anonymous punters the ability to bet that an outcome will not happen is causing corruption in ensure a horse will lose a race, the bookmakers reason). 

Betfair has led their defence by countering that while corruption is possible on any gambling platform, the bookies' arguments are motivated not by concern for the commercial interests. Betfair also asserts that unlike the high street brokers, who all accept anonymous cash bets, Betfair is well aware of who their customers are. Customers are required to create personal accounts, and Betfair keeps records of each customer's betting history. Betfair in particular has noted that they have signed numerous agreements with governing bodies of sport including the Jockey Club, with whom they insist they will co-operate fully if the latter suspects corruption to have taken place.

Betfair embroiled itself in further controversy after suspending payments following a tennis match between Martin Arguello and Nikolay Davydenko, quoting: 'Betfair has suspended settlement of the match-odds market on this afternoon's second-round match of the ATP Orange Prokom Open in Poland between Martin Arguello and Nikolay Davydenko, pending consultation with relevant regulatory authorities.'<ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/other/article.html?in_article_id=59875 Sunday Metro: Betfair suspends betting on tennis clash]</ref> This is believed to be the first time Betfair has suspended payouts in an event after the conclusion of the event.  As of this time, investigations are still pending.
