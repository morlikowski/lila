'''Jigme Singye Wangchuck''' (born Dragon King (Druk Gyalpo)    of Bhutan from 1972 to 2006. He acceded to the throne at the age of 17, in 1972, after the sudden death of his father, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck. When he was formally crowned on June 2, 1974 he was the youngest monarch in the world and the coronation was noted for inviting foreign dignitaries, thus signalling the end of the long isolation of the country. He is also called "Druk Gyalpo," meaning "Dragon King". He was educated in Bhutan and the United Kingdom. 

The fourth king continued his father's policies of slow modernization and socio-economic development for the country while still trying to preserve Bhutanese culture.  In 1988 he instituted the policy of '' Driglam Namzha'' (Etiquette and Manners) which required all citizens to wear traditional clothing while in public, and established the requirement of teaching  Dzongkha (the national language) in schools.  In 1998, he voluntarily reduced the scope of his absolute powers, and began to formally rule with the advice of his government. He is the man behind Bhutan's constitution and the country's first democratic elections in 2008.

In late separatists who were using Bhutanese territory to launch raids against targets in India (see History of Bhutan). Singye also coined the term Gross National Happiness, a concept which is used to help guide the economic and development plans of Bhutan.
