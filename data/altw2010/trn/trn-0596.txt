'''Bari''' ('''''Barium''''' in Greek, '''''Bare''''' in Barese Dialect) is the capital city of the Italian, ''Puglia'') region, on the Adriatic sea, in Italy. It is the second economic centre of mainland Southern Italy and is well known as a port and university city, as well as the city of Saint Nicholas. The city itself has a decreasing population of 328,458 over 116&nbsp;km², while the fast-growing urban area counts 653,028 inhabitants over 203&nbsp;km². Another 500,000 people live in the metropolitan area.

Bari is made up of four different urban sections. To the north, the closely built old town on the peninsula between two modern harbours, with the splendid San Nicola (Saint Nicholas), the Frederick II, is now also one of the major Karol Wojtyla Airport, with connections to several European cities.
==History==
===Ancient===
'''Barion''' (Latin '''Barium'''), does not seem to have been a place of great importance in Roman rule in the third century BC, it developed strategic significance as the point of junction between the coast road and the Tarentum led from Barium. Its harbour, mentioned as early as 181 BC, was probably the principal one of the district in ancient times, as it is at present, and was the centre of a fishery. The first historical Bishop of Bari was Gervasius who was noted at the Council of Sardica in 347. The bishops were dependent on the Patriarch of Constantinople until the 10th century.

===Middle Ages===
After the devastations of the Lombard rule a set of written regulations was established, the ''Consuetudines Barenses'', which influenced similar written constitutions in other southern cities.

For a brief period of 20 years, Bari was captured by Byzantines in 870. In 885, it became the residence of the local Byzantine ''Norman adventurer allies a first foothold in the region. In 1025, under the Archbishop Byzantius, Bari became attached to the see of Rome and was granted "provincial" status. 

In 1071, Bari was captured by three-year siege. Basilica di San Nicola was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were surreptitiously brought from Saint Nicolas of Bari and began to attract pilgrims, whose encouragement and care became central to the Anselm ably defended, seated at the pope's side. The Greeks were not brought over to the Latin way of thinking, and the Great Schism was inevitable.

A civil war broke out in Bari in 1117 with the murder of the archbishop, Riso. Control of Bari was seized by Grimoald Alferanites, a native Lombard, and he was elected lord in opposition to the Normans. By 1123, he had increased ties with Byzantium and Venice and taken the title ''gratia Dei et beati Nikolai barensis princeps''. Grimoald increased the cult of St Nicholas in his city. He later did homage to Roger II of Sicily, but rebelled and was defeated in 1132. 

Bari was occupied by Manuel I Komnenos between 1155-1158. In 1246, Bari was sacked and razed to the ground; Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, repaired the fortress of Baris but it was subsequently destroyed several times. Bari recovered each time.

====The 1943 chemical warfare disaster====

Through a tragic coincidence intended by neither of the opposing sides in World War II, Bari gained the unwelcome distinction of being the only European city to experience chemical warfare in the course of that war. 

On the night of Allied forces fighting their way up the Italian peninsula. Several Allied ships were sunk in the overcrowded harbor, including the U.S. John Harvey'', which was carrying mustard gas, mustard gas was also reported to have been stacked on the quayside awaiting transport. The chemical agent was intended for use if German forces initiated chemical warfare. The presence of the gas was highly classified, and authorities ashore had no knowledge of it. This increased the number of fatalities, since physicians &mdash; who had no idea that they were dealing with the effects of mustard gas &mdash; prescribed treatment proper for those suffering from exposure and immersion, which proved fatal in many cases. Because rescuers were unaware they were dealing with gas casualties many additional casulalties were caused among the rescuers by contact with the contaminated skin and clothing of those more directly exposed to the gas.

On the orders of allied leaders: Italian civilians" [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1889901210]. Part of the confusion and controversy derives from the fact that the German attack, which became nicknamed "The Little Pearl Harbor", was highly destructive and lethal in itself, apart from the effects of the gas. Attribution of the causes of death to the gas, as distinct from the direct effects of the German attack, have proved far from easy. 

The affair is the subject of two books: ''Disaster at Bari'' by Glenn B. Infield and ''Nightmare in Bari: The World War II Liberty Ship Poison Gas Disaster and Coverup'' by Gerald Reminick.

==Bari today==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: thumb|right|400px|Views of the [[Basilica of San Nicola.]] -->

Bari is now mostly a modern industrial city. Nevertheless, some of Italy's most interesting and undiscovered areas lie within the province of Bari, and the region of Puglia. Bari itself is a proud and hard-working port city with strong traditions based on its Saint Nicholas. Bari is known throughout Italy for its strong, often crude, spoken dialect, particularly in the Old Town, parts of which originated from a pidgin between Italian and Greek fishermen in the past, and which fishermen in Greece can still understand today. Bari is also known for its culinary traditions, in particular ''Orecchiette'' with ''Cime di rape'', little ear-shaped pasta with turnip tops, and its common Sunday dish "pasta al forno", which varies from family to family including anything from eggs to Octopus.

==Main sights==
===Basilica di San Nicola===
The ''Basilica di San Nicola'' (Saint Nicholas) was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were brought from Altamura, and the church of Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano.

===Cathedral of St. Sabinus===
thumb|240px|Façade of ''San Sabino'' cathedral.

The church of St. Sabinus (the current Duomo of the city) was begun in Byzantine style in 1034, but was destroyed in the sack of the city of 1156. A new building was thus built between 1170-1178, partially inspired by that of San Nicola. Of the original edifice, only traces of the pavement are today visible in the transept.

An important example of Apulian Romanesque façade with three portals; in the upper part is a rose window decorated with monstruous and fantasy figures. The interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by sixteen columns with arcades. The crypt houses the relics of St. Sabinus and the icon of the ''Madonna Odigitria''. 

The interior and the façade were redecorated in Baroque style during the 18th century, but these additions were deleted in the 1950s restoration.

===Petruzzelli Theatre===
Fire-bombed in the early 1990s, the Petruzzelli theatre had been one of the grandest opera houses in Italy after La Scala in Milan and the San Carlo Theatre in Naples. Host to many famous opera and ballet greats throughout the last century, the shell of the Petruzzelli in Corso Cavour is subject to an ongoing restructuing project. Although seemingly slow, the theatre should re-open its doors before 2010

===Castello Normanno Svevo===

The Norman-Hohenstaufen Castle, widely known as the ''Castello Svevo'', was built by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. The castle now serves as a gallery for a variety of temporary exhibitions in the city.

===The Russian Church===

The Russian Church, in the Carrassi district of Bari was built in the early 20th century to welcome Russian pilgrims who came to the city to visit the church of Saint Nichlas in the old city where the relics of the saint remain.

Built on a large area of council-owned land, the city council and Italian national government were recently involved in a trade-off with the Putin government in Moscow, exchanging the piece of land on which the church stands, for, albeit indirectly, a military barracks near Bari's central station. The hand over was seen as building bridges between the Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches.
