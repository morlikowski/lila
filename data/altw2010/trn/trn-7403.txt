'''Çeksekinandin''' (bi şerê navbera aliyên şrker û pevçûyî (pir caran elata) e.

Çeksekinandin ne hema agirbes e. Agirbes sekinandineka demkurt a şerî li tevaya eniyên şerî an li hindek deverên diyarkirî ye. Lê  çeksekinandin bi awayekî "Modus Vivendi" ye anko aliyên pevçûyî hebûn û mana hevdu dipejirînin û biryarê didin ko jiyan wekî xwe dewam bikit. Bi vî awayî kifş e ko çeksekinandin ne peymana aştiyê ye. Carina jibo peymaneka aştiyê salên dirêj yên danûstandinan divên.

Bi giştî, Rêkxistiya Neteweyên Yekgirtî tenê serperiştiya lihevhatina aliyên pevçûyî jibo agirbesan dikit û pevçûyî bi xwe dibê jibo peymana aştiyê di navbera xwe da danûstandinan bikin. Lewma di qanûna navneteweyî da agirbesên NY aliyan jibo domandina agirbesê neçar nakin.

Mînakên herî berçav yên çeksekinandinê di dîroka nûdem a cîhanê da çeksekinandina Şerê Koreyê li sala 1953ê ye ko heta niha jî çi peymanên aştiyê bi dû ra nehatine.

An '''armistice''' is when the warring parties agree to stop fighting. It is not necessarily the end of a war, but can instead be just a cease fire. It is derived from the Latin ''arma'', meaning weapons  and ''statium'', meaning a stopping. 

A truce or ceasefire usually refers to a temporary cessation of hostilities for an agreed limited time or within a limited area. A truce may be needed in order to negotiate an armistice. 
An armistice is a ''modus vivendi'' and is not the same as a peace treaty, which may take months or even years to agree on.  The 1953 Korean War armistice <ref>{{cite web

The United Nations Security Council often imposes or tries to impose cease-fire resolutions on parties in modern conflicts. Armistices are always negotiated between the parties themselves and are thus generally seen as more binding than non-mandatory UN cease-fire resolutions in modern international law. 

The key aspect in an armistice is the fact that "all fighting ends with no one surrendering". 
This is in contrast to an unconditional surrender, which is a surrender without conditions, except for those provided by international law. 
 
==Notable armistices in history==
The most notable armistice, and the one which is still meant when people say simply "The Armistice", is the armistice at the end of World War I, on Compiègne, France, and effective at the "eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month." <ref>{{cite web

Armistice Day is still celebrated in some places on the anniversary of that armistice; alternatively November 11, or a Sunday near to it, may still be observed as a Remembrance Day.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-01-04
