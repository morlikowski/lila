'''Full moon''' is a opposition with the Sun.<ref></ref> At this time, as seen by viewers on Earth, the hemisphere of the Moon that is facing the earth (the near side) is fully illuminated by the Sun and appears round. Only during a full moon is the opposite hemisphere of the Moon, which is not visible from Earth (the far side), completely unilluminated.

As a lunar month is about 29.531 days long, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th of the lunar month in those calendars that start the month on the new moon. In any event, the period between full moons can be either 29 or 30 days.

== Characteristics ==

Although it takes only 27.322 days on average for the Moon to complete one phases (''e.g.'', between one full moon and the next full moon) is about 29.531 days.  This period is referred to as a lunation, lunar month, or synodic month. The actual number of days in a lunation can vary from about 29.272 to 29.833 because the velocities of the Moon and of the Earth are not constant in their elliptic orbits, and because of gravitational interactions with other bodies in the solar system.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Because the month of February has only 28 days (or 29 in a leap year), there have been a few occasions during which this month has been without a full moon.  In particular, there was no full moon in February of 1866, 1885, 1915, 1934, 1961 or 1999.<ref>MadSci Network: Astronomy — [http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/apr2001/987551549.As.r.html Re: Why didn't February 1865 have a full moon?]</ref> There will be no full moon during February of 2018.<ref>[http://www.moon-phases.net/calendar/index.php?month=2&year=2018 Calendar showing phases of the moon for February 2018, moon-phases.net]</ref> In these years, there were instead either two full moons in January, March, or both (as in 1999).  In the leap year of 1972, there was a full moon on February 29. The previous February 29 full moon occurred in 1820 and before that in 1752.

A full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration. This is somewhat misleading, as the Moon seen from Earth is continuously becoming larger or smaller (though much too slowly to notice with the graphed, its tangent slope is zero.  For any given location, about half of these absolute maximum full moons will be potentially visible, as the other half occur during the day, when the full moon is below the horizon.  Many almanacs list full moons not just by date, but by their exact time as well (usually in GMT). Typical monthly calendars which include phases of the moon may be off by one day if intended for use in a different time zone.   

The date and time of a specific full moon (assuming a circular orbit) can be calculated from the equation:<ref></ref>
:<math> D = 20.362954 + 29.5305888531 \times N + 102.19 \times 10^{-12} \times N^2</math>
where ''D'' is the number of days since UTC, and ''N'' is an integer number of full moons, starting with 0 for the first full moon of the year 2000. The true time of a full moon may differ from this approximation by up to about 14.5 hours as a result of the non-circularity of the moon's orbit. The age and apparent size of the full moon vary in a cycle of just under 14 synodic months, which has been referred to as a full moon cycle. 

Full moons are generally a poor time to conduct astronomical observations, since the bright reflected sunlight from the moon overwhelms the dimmer light from stars.

== Folklore ==

Full Moons are traditionally associated with temporal insomnia, insanity (hence the terms ''lunacy'' and ''lunatic'') and various "magical phenomena" such as lycanthropy. Psychologists, however, have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on human behavior around the time of a full moon.<ref></ref> They find that studies are generally not consistent, with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect. In one instance, the December 23, 2000 issue of the ''British Medical Journal'' published two studies on dog bite admission to hospitals in England and Australia. The study of the Bradford Royal Infirmary found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon, whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in Australia found that they were less likely. 

Many neopagans hold a monthly ritual called an Esbat at each full moon, while some people practicing traditional Chinese religions prepare their ritual offerings to their ancestors and deities on every full and new moon.

==Calendars==
The Hindu, Thai, Hebrew, Islamic, Tibetan, Mayan, Neo-pagan, Celtic, and the traditional Chinese, Jewish, Thai and some Hindu calendars, the full moon always occurs in the middle of a month.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  

In the date of Easter is the first Sunday after the ''ecclesiastical'' full moon which occurs after the ''ecclesiastical'' vernal equinox. In this context, the date of the full moon (together with the date of the vernal equinox) is calculated not according to actual astronomical phenomena, but according to a calendrical approximation of these phenomena.

In the Chinese calendar, the Mid-Autumn Festival falls on the full moon of the eighth month, whereas the Lantern Festival falls on the first full moon of the year.

'''満月'''（まんげつ）とは、黄経差が180度となること、あるいはその瞬間。これを'''望'''（ぼう）ともいう。またこの時に見られる月の形をも指す。これを'''望月'''（ぼうげつ・もちづき）ともいう。

満月の時、月と太陽は地球を間において反対側にある。これが正反対になるとき、日没頃に昇り、夜半に南中し、日の出頃に沈む。日本では、夏は南東から昇って低く南の空を横切る。冬は北に寄り、南中時の満月は天高く位置する。春分･秋分頃は真東あたりから昇り真西あたりに沈む。

満月の月相は14である。月齢は月と太陽の角速度が変動するため一定しないが、平均すれば14.8日（±1.0日、13.8日～15.8日）である。したがって、月齢0を1日とする暦（大部分の太陰太陽暦と太陰暦）では、満月は平均して16日の朝7時ごろになる（この時刻はどちらかといえば16日の夜より15日の夜に近い）。このため中国暦では伝統的に15日の夜の月が満月とされ、また15日を'''望日'''と呼んだ。

満月のときは地形がよく見えるほど地上を明るく照らす。

満月はしばしば鑑賞の対象となり、8月15日（中秋/秋夕）は、中国・韓国などでは特別の日として年中行事が行われている。

満月には不思議な力があるとも、満月の夜には犯罪が増えるとも言われていて、これを証明するデータも存在しているとされるが統計的には疑わしく、また機序はまったく不明である。
