'''南タイ語'''（みなみタイご　<font lang＝"th">ภาษาใต้</font>）はタイ族の喋る南タイ語を標準的な言葉として、ムスリムの喋る南タイ語と、華僑の喋る南タイ語を持つ。標準語の持つアクセントに縛られず、全体的に高声が目立つ。一語の持つ声調がある程度決まっているものの、文章中で前後に来る言葉によってその語の声調は変わり、流動的である。語彙は後述するように、マレー語や中国語の華南方言からの借用語が中央タイ語に比べて多い。

ムスリムの南タイ語は国内ではヤーウィー語（Javi、<font lang＝"th">ยาวี</font>。ジャワ（Java）の語が変化したもの）と呼ばれるマレー語の影響が強く、<font lang＝"th">บัง</font>（マレー語bang←abang。兄さん）、<font lang＝"th">มะ</font>（mak。母さん）などの語が会話の中に目立つ。中には、<font lang＝"th">อาลลามะ</font>（allahmak、なんてこった！）のように宗教関係なく使われるものも有る。

華僑の南タイ語は独特の語彙をもっていて、主に家庭内で使われているが、ムスリムよりも同化が激しいため、現在ではあまりみられなくなった。

'''Southern Thai''' or '''Dambro''' (Thai: ภาษาไทยใต้, IPA: pʰaːsaː tʰajɗaj; Thai: ภาษาตามโปร, IPA: pʰaːsaː ɗaːmbro) is a Tai language spoken in the 14 changwat of Southern Thailand as well as by small communities in the northernmost Malaysian states. It is spoken by roughly five million people, and as a second language by the 1.5 million speakers of Pattani Malay and other ethnic groups such as the local Thai Chinese communities, Negritos, and other tribal groups.  Most speakers are also fluent or understand the standard Thai language.

==Distribution==
In Thailand, speakers of Southern Thai can be found from as far north as Tumbat, Kelantan, Perlis, Kedah, and Perak.  It is the primary language of Thai people as well as ethnically Malay people on both sides of the Thai-Malaysian border, who often use it as a second language. Although numerous regional variations exist and there is no one standard, the language is most distinct near the Malaysian border, but all varieties remain mutually intelligible to each other. For economic reasons, many speakers of Southern Thai have moved to Bangkok and other Thai cities or to the Middle East, where many speakers share Islam as a professed religion.

==History==
Malay kingdoms ruled much of the Malay Peninsula, such as the Pattani Kingdom and Tambralinga, but most of the area fell under the rule of Srivijaya.  The area was heavily influenced by the culture of Indian traders, and numerous Buddhist and Hindu shrines attest to the diffusion of culture.  The collapse of Srivijaya was filled by the growth of the Kingdom of Nakhon Sri Thammaraj, which subsequently became a vassal of Sukhothai.  The area has been a frontier between the northern Tai peoples and the southern Malay peoples as well as between Buddhism and Islam.  The tensions fuelled by brutal Thaification policies, suppression of local culture, and general poverty has lead to the current South Thailand insurgency.  

==Differences from Standard Thai==
Although the most similar in lexicon and grammar of the major regional languages of Thailand, Southern Thai is different enough that mutual intelligibility between the two can be problematic.  Southern Thai represents a diglossic situation from the formal Thai spoken with Southern Thai tones and accent to the common language, which utilises more local vocabulary and incorporates more words from Pattani Malay.  The Thai language was introduced with Siamese incursions into the Malay Peninsula starting as early as Sukhothai, and the area in which Southern Thai is spoken was a frontier zone between the Malay Sultanates. Malay vocabulary is an integral part of the vocabulary as Malay was formerly spoken throughout the region and many speakers of the language still speak the Pattani dialect of Malay.

Southern Thai is mainly a spoken language, although the Thai alphabet is often used to write it in the informal situations when it is written.  It is also sometimes written in a modified version of the Arabic script, known as Jawi, especially when written by religious Muslims and the Pattani.
