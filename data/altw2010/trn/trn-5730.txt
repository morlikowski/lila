'''Echoes of Eternity''' is a progressive metal band based in Los Angeles. Their debut album ''The Forgotten Goddess'', was released in February 2007 on Nuclear Blast records.

== History ==

Echoes of Eternity was founded in 2005 by South Carolina natives Kirk Carrison and Brandon Patton, who had previously played in the Full Sail recording school in Florida.  The two began dating and moved to Los Angeles together following their graduation in 2001 to seek work in recording studios.  After a few failed music projects, Carrison urged longtime friend and guitarist Patton to move to Los Angeles and form a band. The two enlisted Canadian-born Francine on vocals, who had previously created and recorded her own work with the intention of scoring films.  The band then added bassist Duane Cowan, who had recently relocated from Japan to Los Angeles.

The group recorded a three song demo, which was sent out to producers and labels, and eventually found it's way to noted producer and guitarist Roy Z, who expressed interest in the band.  Z initially wanted to produce the band, but was busy with other projects, and passed the demo along to Nuclear Blast records, who signed the band in 2006.<ref name="Metal Warrants interview with Francine"></ref>

The band entered Raven's Work studio in June 2006 to begin work on their debut release.  Carrison, who was an assistant engineer at Raven's Work, was afforded studio time at night and on the weekends to record, although the studio is primarily used for American thrash metal with European style female-fronted gothic metal.

On February 20th, 2007, Echoes Of Eternity released their debut album ''ProTooled, synthetic, stiff nature of the riffs and the drumming",<ref name="Brave Words review"></ref> while Jeff Maki of Live-Metal.net said the album features "beautiful melodies galore, backed by a start-stop machine gun double bass attack and a classic metal guitar sound."<ref></ref>

Echoes of Eternity added second guitarist Sam Young in 2007, and filmed a video for the song "Voices in a Dream" with director Ole Carlson.  In June 2007, the band embarked on a US tour opening for Symphony X and Sanctity, in the fall they toured with Edguy, Into Eternity, and Light This City and later toured with Trail of Tears and Unexpect .  Currently the band is writing material for their second album.

==Biographie==
Gegründet wurde die Band von Gitarrist Brandon Patton und seinem langjährigen Freund Kirk Carrison, die sich bereits aus mehreren Death-Metal-Bands kannten. Mit Echoes of Eternity wollten sie eine Band mit Frontfrau gründen. Kurz danach ergänzten Duane Cowan am Bass und Francine Boucher als Sängerin Echoes of Eternity. Nach einer selbst veröffentlichten EP <!--und einem Splitalbum--> unterschrieben sie im Juli 2006 einen Plattenvertrag bei Nuclear Blast. In den RavensWork Studios in Venice entstand in sechsmonatiger Arbeit ihr Debütalbum ''The Forgotten Goddess'', dass am 2. Februar 2007 erschienen ist. Im selben Monat kam Sam Young als zweiter Gitarrist zur Band.
