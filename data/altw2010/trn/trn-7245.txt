The '''cloudberry''' (''Rubus chamaemorus''), also called '''bakeapple''' in Newfoundland and Labrador, Cape Breton Island and southern Nova Scotia, is a slow-growing alpine or sub-Arctic species of ''Rubus'', producing amber-colored edible fruit. The botanical name (''chamæmorus'') derives from the Greek ''khamai'' ("on the ground") and ''moros'' ("mulberry"). Cloudberry is the name for both the plant and the fruit. Cloudberry should not be confused with salmonberry, although the fruit looks similar.  

The cloudberry grows to 10-25 cm high. The leaves alternate between having 5 and 7 soft, handlike lobes on straight, branchless stalks. After pollination, the white (sometimes reddish-tipped) berries. Encapsulating between 5 and 25 drupelets, each fruit is initially pale red, ripening into an amber colour in early autumn.

== Distribution and ecology ==
Cloudberries occur naturally throughout the Britain and Ireland, much in the Baltic states, and across northern Russia east to the Pacific Ocean. Small populations are also found further south, as a botanical vestige of the Ice Ages; it is found in Germany's Weser and Elbe valleys, where it is under legal protection. In North America, cloudberries grow wild across most of Canada / Alaska, and in the lower 48 states of the United States in northern Minnesota, New Hampshire, Maine, and a small population on Long Island, New York.

The cloudberry can withstand cold temperatures down to well below -40°C, but is sensitive to salt and to dry conditions. It grows in bogs, marshes and wet meadows and requires sunny exposures in acidic ground (between 3.5 and 5 ''p''H). 

Cloudberry leaves are food for caterpillars of several Lepidoptera species. The moth ''Coleophora thulea'' has no other known foodplants. See also List of Lepidoptera that feed on Rubus.

Wide distribution occurs due to the opening of capsules by birds and animals and the excretion of the indigestible seeds. Further distribution arises through its rhizomes which can develop extensive berry patches. Cuttings of these taken in May or August are successful in producing a genetic clone of the parent plant.<ref>{{cite journal

== Cultivation ==

Despite its modern demand as a delicacy exceeding supply (particularly in Norway) the cloudberry is primarily a wild plant. Wholesale prices vary widely based on the size of the yearly harvest, but can reach 10€/kg.<ref></ref>

Since the middle of the 1990s, however, the species has formed part of the "Northernberries" research project. The Norwegian government, in cooperation with Finnish, Swedish and Scottish counterparts, has vigorously pursued the aim of enabling commercial production of various wild berries (Norway imports 200 - 300 tonnes of cloudberries per year from Finland). Beginning in 2002, selected cultivars have been available to farmers, notably "Apolto" (male), "Fjellgull" (female) and "Fjordgull" (female). The cloudberry can be cultivated in Arctic areas where few other crops are possible, for example along the northern coast of Norway.

=== Uses ===
The ripe fruits are golden-yellow, soft and juicy, and are rich in vitamin C. When eaten fresh, cloudberries have a distinctive tart taste. When over-ripe, they have a creamy texture and flavor somewhat like yogurt. They are often made into jams, juices, tarts, and liqueurs. In Finland, the berries are eaten with "Leipäjuusto" (a local cheese; the name translates to "bread-cheese"), and lots of cream and sugar. In Sweden, cloudberries are used as topping for ice cream or waffles. In Norway, they are eaten with whipped cream and lots of sugar, or in cakes that often contain marzipan. In Canada, cloudberries are used to flavour a special beer. Canadians also use them for jam, but not on the same scale as Scandinavians.
In Alaska, the berries are mixed with seal oil, reindeer or caribou fat (which is diced up and made fluffy with the seal oil) and sugar to make "Eskimo Ice Cream" or Agutuk. The recipes vary by region. Along the Yukon and Kuskokwim river areas, white fish(pike,whitefish) along with Crisco and sugar is used.
Due to its high vitamin C content, the berry is valued both by Nordic seafarers and by Canadian Inuit as protection against scurvy. Its high benzoic acid content acts as a natural preservative.

Tea made from cloudberry leaves was used in ancient Scandinavian herbal medicine to cure urinary tract infections.

==== Alcoholic drinks ====
In Nordic countries traditionally liqueurs such as ''Lakkalikööri'' (a Finnish liqueur) are made of cloudberry. It has a strong taste and a high sugar content. Cloudberry has also served as a spice for aquavit.

A '''amora-branca-silvestre''' (''Rubus chamaemorus'') é uma espécie de crescimento lento do género ''grego ''chamai'' ("anã") e ''morus'' ("amora").

A amora-branca-silvestre chega a atingir 10-25 cm de altura. As suas folhas são alternadas, frágeis, palmadas e dispõem-se em caules erectos sem ramos. depois da polinização, as suas flores brancas (por vezes com laivos avermelhados) formam amoras do tamanho de framboesas, unindo em si de 5 a 25 pequenas drupas, inicialmente de um vermelho pálido que se torna cor de  âmbar no início do outono.

===Distribuição===
As amoras-brancas-silvestres são espontâneas no áreas montanhosas. Na eras glaciares, como nos vales alemães do Elba, onde são protegidas por lei. Na América do Norte, existem no Canadá e no Alasca e, menos, no norte dos estados do Minnesota, New Hampshire, Maine, além da pequena população de Long Island, Nova Iorque.

Nascem em pântanos e outros terrenos alagadiços, como estuários, e requerem exposição solar e solo ácido (entre 3,5 e 5 de ''p''H). Suportam facilmente temperaturas baixas (até menos de - 40°C), mas são sensíveis ao sal e à falta de água.

===Propagação===
Ao contrário de muitas espécies do género ''Rubus'', a amora-branca-selvagem não procede à propagam assexuadamente através de extensões do seu rizoma.

Apesar da procura cada vez maior no mercado das frutas silvestres, principalmente na Noruega, a amora-branca-silvestre é, essencialmente, uma planta silvestre.
