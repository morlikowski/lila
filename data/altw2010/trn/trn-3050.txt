In gioventù debutta come batterista e ballerino con, tra gli altri, il grande Art Tatum, poi si dedica esclusivamente al canto, soprattutto scat (ovvero improvvisando senza parole). Attorno al 1952 rimane folgorato dalle registrazioni di Eddie Jefferson e King Pleasure (''Moody's mood for love''), inventori del vocalese, e comincia lui stesso  a scrivere brillanti testi su famosi temi e assoli jazz (''Don't get scared'', dal disco europeo di Stan Getz e Lars Gullin).

Nel 1957 fonda con Dave Lambert e Annie Ross l'omonimo trio vocale e collabora con Count Basie, Zoot Sims, Harry Sweets Edison, Pony Poindexter. I tre  cantano brani di Duke Ellington, Randy Weston, Horace Silver, Charlie Parker e tutti i maggiori artisti dell'epoca. Nel 1962 la Ross viene sostituita per ragioni di salute da Yolande Bavan, ma il gruppo dura poco perché nel 1966 muore Dave Lambert. Hendricks alterna progetti da solista a lavori corali in cui coinvolge la moglie e le figlie (Family).

Nel 1991 partecipa al Festival di Sanremo cantando in inglese la canzone dei Ladri di Biciclette, ''Lemme Hear Some o' That Be-Bop''.

'''Jon Hendricks''' (born September 16, 1921) is an American jazz lyricist and singer.  He is considered one of the originators of vocalese, which adds lyrics to existing instrumental songs and replaces many instruments with vocalists (such as the big band arrangements of Duke Ellington and Count Basie). Furthermore, he is considered one of the best practitioners of scat singing, which involves vocal jazz soloing. For his work as a lyricist, jazz critic and historian Leonard Feather called him the "Poet Laureate of Jazz" while Time dubbed him the "James Joyce of Jive." Al Jarreau has called him "pound-for-pound the best jazz singer on the planet—maybe that's ever been".<ref>''Artist Confidential'' interview with Al Jarreau. XM Radio, 2007.</ref>

==Life==
Born in 1921 in A.M.E. pastor, before settling permanently in Toledo. As a teenager, Jon's first interest was in the drums, but before long he was singing on the radio regularly with another Toledo native, the extraordinary pianist Art Tatum.

After serving in the Army during World War II, Hendricks went home to attend University of Toledo as a Pre-law major, courtesy of the G.I. Bill. Just when he was about to enter the graduate law program, the G.I. benefits ran out, and he realized he would have to chart a different course. Recalling that Charlie Parker had, at a stop in Toledo two years prior, encouraged him to come to New York and look him up, Hendricks moved there and began his singing career.

In 1957, he teamed with Dave Lambert and Annie Ross to form the legendary vocal trio Lambert, Hendricks & Ross. With Jon as lyricist, the trio perfected the art of vocalese and took it around the world, earning them the designation of the "Number One Vocal Group in the World" for five years in a row from Melody Maker magazine. After six years the trio disbanded for solo careers, but not before leaving behind a catalog of legendary recordings, most of which have never gone out of print. Countless singers cite the work of LH&R as an influence, from Van Morrison<!--www.harbour.sfu.ca/~hayward/van/reviews/2004jazziz.html--> to Al Jarreau to Bobby McFerrin. Hendricks's composition "Yeh-Yeh" became a 1965 pop hit for British R&B-jazz singer Georgie Fame, who continues to record and perform Lambert, Hendricks & Ross compositions to this day.

Pursuing a solo career, Hendricks moved his young family to Berkeley. A piece he wrote specifically for the stage about the history of jazz, Evolution of the Blues, ran an unprecedented five years at the Off-Broadway Theatre in Peabody awards.

Jon Hendricks recorded several critically-acclaimed albums on his own, some with his wife Judith and daughters Michele and Aria contributing. He collaborated with old friends Vocalese'', which won seven Carter, Reagan, and Clinton.
