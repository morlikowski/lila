'''Alice Brady''' (* 2. November 1892 in New York City; &dagger; 28. Oktober 1939 in New York City) war eine US-amerikanische Schauspielerin.

Alice Brady war die Tochter des Broadwayproduzenten Ersten Weltkrieg. Ihren ersten Film drehte sie bereits 1914. Auch hier verhalf ihr der Vater als Filmproduzent zu einem leichten Einstieg in die Filmbranche, die zu dieser Zeit noch New York als ihre Metropole hatte. Ihre letzten Stummfilm drehte sie 1923, blieb allerdings weiterhin Theaterschauspielerin am Broadway.

Als ausgezeichnete Theaterschauspielerin gelang ihr mit Beginn des Tonfilms ein problemloser Übergang zu dem neuen Medium und der Entschluss zu einer Filmkarriere in Hollywood. Ihr erster Tonfilm entstand 1933 mit ''When Ladies Meet'' an der Seite von Ann Harding, Robert Montgomery und Myrna Loy. 1937 wurde sie für ihre Rolle in ''Mein Mann Godfrey'' erstmals für einen Oscar nominiert, den sie schließlich für 1938 für ''In Old Chicago'' erhielt.

Alice Brady starb 1939 im Alter von nur 46 Jahren an Krebs, kurz nachdem sie die Dreharbeiten zu ''Young Mr. Lincoln'' abgeschlossen hatte.
