'''Imperial Palace''' is a 2,640 room hotel and a 75,000 square foot (7,000 m²) casino located on the famed Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada.  The hotel and casino were owned by Imperial Palace LLC until purchased by the current owner, '''Harrah's Imperial Palace Corporation''' a subsidiary of Harrah's Entertainment.

==History==
From 1959 to 1979 the property was called the Flamingo Capri.  In 1979, it was renamed to the Asian-themed Imperial Palace by new owner Ralph Engelstad.  When Ralph died in 2002, the casino ownership transferred to the ''Ralph Engelstad and Betty Engelstad Trust''.  The casino operated as its own limited partnership, Imperial Palace LLC, under the Trust's oversight.

The property underwent a major renovation in 1988 which added an 18-story tower.

On August 22, 2005, Harrah's announced plans to purchase this property. The acquisition was completed on December 23, 2005.

During a conference call with investors on O'Sheas "are going to require very substantial modifications or complete tear-downs and rebuilds" in order to make room for a Harrah's and/or Flamingo expansion on the Strip. [http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article.cfm?contentID=154885]
