'''''House of Sand and Fog''''' is a American novel of the same name by Andre Dubus III. 

The story concerns the battle between a young woman and an immigrant Iranian family over ownership of a house in Northern California which ultimately has dire consequences. 

== Plot ==
Kathy Nicolo is a recovering addict living in a small house near the coast in Northern California that she and her brother inherited from their father. Abandoned by her husband and trapped by a malaise that has left her depressed and unresponsive to her surroundings, she ignores a number of notices threatening her with eviction for an alleged nonpayment of business taxes. She only becomes aware of her precarious situation when the police forcibly remove her and her belongings from the house and put it up for auction.

Immigrant Massoud Amir Behrani, a former Iranian Army, fled his homeland with his family during a time of conflict and now lives in flip the property and use the profits to buy a larger home. 

Taking the advice of Deputy Sheriff Lester Burdon, who was assigned to handle her eviction, Kathy seeks legal assistance to regain title to her house. Attorney Connie Walsh is confident the fact her property was wrested away from her based on an incorrect assumption she owed taxes will force the county to return Massoud's money and reinstall her in the house. Massoud, however, is not prepared to accept anything less than the appraised value of the property.

Lester leaves his wife and children and becomes Kathy's protector, confronting Massoud and threatening him with vomit the medication. As she and her husband are trying to get Kathy into the bedroom, Lester comes looking for her, misinterprets what he sees, and holds the Behrani family hostage until Massoud agrees to his proposal - accept the $45,000 he paid for the house from the county and relinquish the payment to Kathy in exchange for her giving him title to the property.  

Massoud and his son accompany Lester to the county office to finalize the transaction. On the steps, Esmail seizes Lester's gun and aims it at him. Though dishelveled Lester still wears his police uniform and the commotion draws two police officers. To them a fellow officer is being held hostage. The officers draw their weapons and in the confusion Esmail Behrani turns towards them. They shoot in what they believe to be self defence. Esmail is rushed to hospital. He does not survive.

Overcome with grief, Massoud returns home. He drugs his wife's tea with a lethal dose of medication, then dons his old military uniform, tapes a plastic dust cover around his head, and slowly CPR, but is unsuccessful. As their bodies are being taken away by paramedics, a policeman asks Kathy if the house is hers. After a pause, she quietly replies that it isn't.

==Production notes==
terrorists and other assorted villains, she turned to a career in the theatre. This film marked her return to the screen after nearly two decades <ref>''House of Sand and Fog'' DVD Special Features</ref>.

Jonathan Ahdout, whose previous acting experience was limited to school plays, was cast as Esmail Behrani two days prior to the start of filming. His original audition had not impressed Vadim Perelman, but when he began to have doubts about the actor he ultimately had hired, he reviewed the audition tapes and saw something in Ahdout's performance he felt he previously had overlooked. He called him back and had him meet and perform with Aghdashloo. The chemistry between them convinced Perelman the boy was right for the part <ref>''House of Sand and Fog'' DVD Special Features</ref>.

Establishing shots were filmed in San Francisco, Carpinteria, Pacifica, San Mateo County, and Santa Clarita, but the house of the title actually is located in Malibu.
 
An original soundtrack album featuring James Horner's film score and songs by Mohammad Heydari and Elton Ahi was released by Varèse Sarabande.

The film grossed $13,040,288 in the US and $3,902,507 in foreign markets for a worldwide box office total of $16,942,795 <ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=houseofsandandfog.htm ''House of Sand and Fog'' at Box Office Mojo]</ref>.
