Chamillionaire announced that his first official single off ''Ultimate Victory'' is "Hip Hop Police" featuring Slick Rick and produced by J. R. Rotem. The next single is The Evening News which was the second part of the "Hip Hop Police video. Chamillionaire will release music videos in sequential order to make it seem like a mini movie.<ref>[http://www.wordofsouth.com/releasedates.php Down South Hip-Hop and R&B Online Magazine at WordofSouth.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The first video, "Hip Hop Police", premiered in full, along with "Evening News", on July 26 on BET ''Access Granted''.

The song "The Bill Collecta" featuring Bone Thugs-N-Harmony member Krayzie Bone, was serviced to radio on September 18 2007. It was going to be made into a video, but was turned into a street single instead.

The song titled "Industry Groupie" from the album heavily samples the song "The Final Countdown" by Europe. The song used the same beat with a hip hop twist. like "The Bill Collecta" it was going to become a video, but became a street single.

Chamillionaire kept the album clean (no swearing, no explicit sexual references, no violence) and 'n-word free. Chamillionaire says that he made this decision after hearing white fans rap to his "n-words" in his previous album.<ref>Steve Jones, [http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-09-16-chamillionaire_N.htm "Chamillionaire triumphs over cursing on 'Ultimate Victory'"], ''USA Today'', September 16, 2007.</ref> He said that he wasn't gonna make a big deal of not cursing and release the album with other rappers cursing, but then said he had to make a "political desicion" to keep the album clean. Also while on Larry King Live on December 4, 2007 he said that it was a "moral desicion" to not say the n-word on Ultimate Victory.  There was a Explicit Version leaked onto the internet but the track "Pimp Mode" was left censored but unlike the retail version of the album it was censored by a gunshot.

Explicit versions of "Rock Star" featuring Lil Wayne and "You Must Be Crazy" featuring Famous have been released on Chamilitary's MySpace page.

On September 14 2007, Chamillionaire, Famous and Slick Rick appeared on ''The Late Show with David Letterman'' and performed "Hip Hop Police." On September 18 2007, Chamillionaire, Famous, and Slick Rick appeared on ''Total Request Live'' and performed "Hip Hop Police".

Later in October he made an exclusive visit for the first time to India, and performed live rapping at Bottles & Chimneys, Hyderabad to the beats of DJ Shaun (Shaun Ryder).

==Critical reception==

''Ultimate Victory'' was very well-received by many critics. Rolling Stone praised the title track stating, "“The Ultimate Victory”—on which Cham expresses sympathy for media-dogged celebrities like Eminem and Britney Spears and admits, "I'm still filled with doubt"—might be the most personally reflective hip-hop track since Slim Shady himself stepped to the mic." Allmusic said that it is "a positive outlook for the future of the genre." Allhiphop.com praised his lyricism, stating, "Chamillionaire's flow and lyricism is rampant through each track on Ultimate Victory." Sputnikmusic acknowledged that the album was a "cohesive and complete album in the world of Southern rap." Sixshot declared "“The Ultimate Victory” is the biggest thing to come out of Texas since the space shuttle." Hip Hop DX stated, "Chamillionaire effortlessly transitions from one subject to the next without coming off too overbearing or preachy. Blending his trademark, butter-smooth melodies with hard-hitting beats and intricate punch lines, The Ultimate Victory is an interesting blend of braggadocio, thought-provoking, political undertones and bravado, something rarely seen from today’s mainstream emcee."

Албумът излиза на американския пазар на 18 септември 2007 г., а във Великобритания - две седмици по-късно.

Песните не съдържат псувни, сексистки забележки и насилие и затова на обложката липсва логото ''Parental Advisory'', което предупреждава за такова съдържание и се среща доста често на обложките на албуми от този стил музика. 

Досега издадените сингли от албума са Hip Hop Police (18 юни 2007), The Bill Collecta (18 септември 2007) и Industry Groupie (10 октомври 2007).
