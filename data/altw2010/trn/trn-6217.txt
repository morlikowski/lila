Sir '''''Edmund'' Percival Hillary''', född nyzeeländsk bergsbestigare, mest känd för att tillsammans med Tenzing Norgay vara den förste som besteg Mount Everest den 29 maj 1953.

Bragden utfördes som en del av den nionde brittiska expeditionen till Mount Everest, ledd av sir John Hunt. 

==Ungdom==
Hillary föddes i Tuakau, söder om Auckland där han gick på Auckland Grammar School. Färden till skolan var över två timmar lång åt båda hållen, tid som han använde till att läsa. När han växte upp var han mindre än sina klasskamrater och väldigt blyg så han tog sin tillflykt till böcker och dagdrömde om ett liv fyllt av äventyr. Vid 16 års ålder blev han intresserad av klättring under en skolresa till Ruapehu. Han insåg att hans gängliga och osamordnade kropp var fysiskt stark och hade större uthållighet än flera av hans bergsklättrarvänner.

==Expeditioner==

Under andra världskriget var han navigatör i Royal New Zealand Air Force. Han utgjorde en del av den brittiska spaningsexpeditionen till Everest 1951 ledd av Eric Shipton innan han gick med i det framgångsrika försöket 1953. Han besteg tio andra toppar i Himalaya under andra resor 1956, 1960–1961 och 1963–1965. Han nådde även Sydpolen som en del av Samväldets transantarktiska expedition, för vilken han ledde den nyzeeländska sektionen den 4&nbsp;januari 1958. Han ledde också en jetbåtsexpedition från mynningen av Ganges till dess källa 1977.

År 1979 skulle han ha varit guide på den skickelsedigra Air New Zealand Flight 901, men var tvungen att dra sig ur på grund av arbetsåtaganden annorstädes. Han ersattes av den nära vännen Peter Mulgrew som förolyckades med flygplanet.

==Erkännande==
Hilary dubbades till riddare när han blev kommendör av första klass av Brittiska Imperieorden den 16 juli 1953. Han är också medlem av Order of New Zealand (1987) och den 23 april 1995 tilldelades han Storbritanniens förnämsta utmärkelse, Strumpebandsorden.

Han är den enda levande nyzeeländaren som är med på en dollarsedel.  Flera gator, skolor och organisationer runtom i Nya Zeeland och utomlands är nämnda efter honom. Några exempel är ''Hillary College'' i Otara, ''Edmund Hillary Primary School'' i Papakura och ''Hillary Commission''.

För att markera tillfället för 50-årsjubileet av den första framgångsrika bestigningen av Everest gav den nepalesiska regeringen ett hedersmedborgarskap till sir Edmund vid en särskild jubileumsfest i Nepals huvudstad. Katmandu. Han är den första utländska personen att få en sådan titel av den nepalska staten.

==Filantropi==
Hillary har ägnat mycket av sitt liv åt att hjälpa sherper i Nepal genom höge kommissarie'' till Indien, där han flitigt efterfrågades som hedersgäst.

Hillary har på senare tid pratat om hans förakt för attityden som många moderna bergsbestigare har. Han har särskilt kritiserat nya zeeländaren Mark Inglis och fyrtio andra klättrare som, i flera olika grupper, lämnade den brittiske klättraren David Sharp att dö i maj 2006. Hillary sade: ”Jag tycker att hela attityden mot att bestiga Mount Everst har blivit ganska skräckinjagande. Människorna vill bara komma upp på toppen, det är fel mot en man som lider av höghöjdsproblem och ligger under en sten, bara att lyfta på hatten, säga god morgon och fortsätta förbi.” Han berättade också för ''New Zealand Herald'' att han var skräckslagen över den känslokalla attityden bland dagens klättrare. ”De bryr sig inte ett dugg om någon annan som kan vara i fara och det imponerar mig inte alls att de lämnar någon under en sten för att dö.”

'''Sir Edmund Percival Hillary''', KG, ONZ, KBE (mountaineer and explorer. On first climbers known to have reached the summit of John Hunt.

Hillary became interested in mountaineering while in high school, making his first major climb in 1939, reaching the summit of RNZAF as a navigator during World War II. Before the successful expedition in 1953 to Everest, he had been part of a reconnaissance expedition to the mountain in 1951 and an unsuccessful attempt to climb Cho Oyu in 1952. As part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition he reached the South Pole overland in 1958. He would later also travel to the North Pole.

Following his ascent of Everest he devoted much of his life to helping the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he founded. Through his efforts many schools and hospitals were built in this remote region of the Himalayas.

==Youth==

Hillary was educated at Tuakau Primary School and then Auckland Grammar School.<ref name=early/> He finished primary school two years early, but struggled at high school, achieving only average marks.<ref name="Time obit">Simon Robinson, [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1702543,00.html Sir Edmund Hillary: Top of the World], ''Time Magazine'', 2008-01-10. Accessed 2008-01-14.</ref> He was initially smaller than his peers there and very shy so he took refuge in his books and daydreams of a life filled with adventure. His daily train journey to and from high school was over two hours each way, during which he regularly used the time to read. He gained confidence after he learnt to box. At 16 his interest in climbing was sparked during a school trip to Mount Ruapehu. Though gangly at 6 ft 5 in (195cm) and uncoordinated, he found that he was physically strong and had greater endurance than many of his tramping companions.<ref name=times1>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article3170995.ece Timesonline.co.uk dated January 112008, retrieved January 12 2008]</ref>
He studied mathematics and science at The University of Auckland, and in 1939 completed his first major climb, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier, near Mt. Cook in the Southern Alps.<ref name=early/>
With his brother Rex, Hillary became a beekeeper,<ref name="Christchurch" /><ref name="time" /> a summer occupation that allowed him to pursue climbing in the winter.<ref name="natlgeo" />

==World War II==
Upon the outbreak of religious conscience".<ref name="nzheraldlife"></ref> Following the introduction of conscription on the outbreak of war in the Pacific, in 1943 Hillary joined the RNZAF as a Catalina flying boats. In 1945 he was sent to Fiji and to the Solomon Islands where he was badly burned in a boating accident, after which he was repatriated to New Zealand.<ref name="nzheraldlife" />

==Expeditions==
Hillary was part of a British reconnaissance expedition to Everest in 1951 led by Eric Shipton before joining the successful British attempt of 1953.

In 1952 Hillary and George Lowe were part of the British team led by Eric Shipton that attempted Cho Oyu. After that attempt failed due to the lack of route from the Nepal side, Hillary and Lowe crossed the Lho-La into Tibet and reached the old Camp II, on the northern side, where all the pre-war expeditions camped.

===1953 Everest Expedition===
thumb|left|On top of the world: [[Tenzing Norgay|Tenzing on the summit of Mt Everest.  Photograph taken by Hillary, 29 May 1953.]]
The route to Everest was closed by Chinese-controlled Swiss expedition (in which Tenzing took part) had attempted to reach the summit in 1952 but was turned back by bad weather  from the summit. During a 1952 trip in the Alps Hillary discovered he and his friend George Lowe had been invited by the Joint Himalayan Committee for the approved British 1953 attempt and immediately accepted.<ref name="HighAdventure">Hillary, Edmund, ''High Adventure: The True Story of the First Ascent of Everest''</ref>

Shipton was named as leader but was replaced by Hunt. Hillary considered pulling out, but both Hunt and Shipton talked him into remaining. Hillary was intending to climb with Lowe but Hunt named two teams for the assault: Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans; and Hillary and Tenzing. Hillary therefore made a concerted effort to forge a working friendship with Tenzing.<ref name="HighAdventure" />

The Hunt expedition totaled over 400 people, including 362 porters, twenty Lhotse Face, a huge and steep ice face, for climbing. Hillary forged a route through the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.<ref name="HighAdventure" />

The expedition set up base camp in March 1953. Working slowly it set up its final camp at the South Col at . On 26 May Bourdillon and Evans attempted the climb but turned back when Evans' oxygen system failed. The pair had reached the South Summit, coming within 300 vertical feet (91 m) of the summit.<ref name=rgs>[http://www.unlockingthearchives.rgs.org/resources/documents/Reaching%20the%20Top3.pdf ''REACHING THE TOP''] Royal Geographical Society, retrieved January 13, 2008.</ref><ref name="nzedge" /> Hunt then directed Hillary and Tenzing to go for the summit.

Snow and wind held the pair up at the South Col for two days. They set out on thumb|right|Sir Edmund (left) and Tenzing after they had come down from the Everest summit in [[1953<br> ]] -->

They spent only about 15 minutes at the summit. They looked for evidence of the 1924 Mallory expedition, but found none.<ref>In 1999, George Mallory's well preserved frozen body was found at the 27,000 ft level. His camera was not located, and if is ever found, the film inside could provide a definitive answer to whether he and Sandy Irvine summited Everest in 1924.

The two had to take care on the descent after discovering that drifting snow had covered their tracks, complicating the task of retracing their steps. The first person they met was Lowe, who had climbed up to meet them with hot soup.

News of the successful expedition reached Britain on the day of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The group was surprised by the international acclaim that they received upon arriving in Kathmandu.<ref name="HighAdventure" />
Hillary and Hunt were knighted by the young queen,<ref name=gazetteKnighthood></ref> while Tenzing received either the British Empire Medal,<ref name=pbsnova/> or the George Medal from the British Government for his efforts with the expedition.<ref name=NorgayODNB></ref><ref></ref>  It has been suggested that Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru refused permission for Tenzing to be knighted.<ref name=NorgayODNB />

===After Everest===
thumb|right|200px|Hillary in 1957 after accompanying the first plane to land at the [[Marble Point ground air strip, Antarctica]]
Hillary climbed ten other peaks in the Himalayas on further visits in 1956, 1960&ndash;61, and 1963&ndash;65. He also reached the South Pole as part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, for which he led the New Zealand section, on 4 January 1958. His party was the first to reach the Pole overland since Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles. In 1977, he led a jetboat expedition, titled "Ocean to Sky", from the mouth of the Ganges River to its source. 

In 1979, as he had done previously,<ref>[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/erebus-disaster/visiting-antarctica ''The Antarctic experience - Erebus disaster''] New Zealand History online, retrieved January 13, 2008.</ref> Hillary was scheduled to act as a commentator on the ill-fated Air New Zealand Flight 901, an Antarctic sightseeing flight, but had to pull out due to work commitments elsewhere. He was replaced by his close friend Peter Mulgrew, who perished as the aircraft crashed on Mount Erebus, killing all 257 on board.<ref>Radio New Zealand, [http://www.radionz.co.nz/nr/programmes/sir_edmund_hillary Sir Edmund Hillary: A Tribute], Retrieved January 14, 2008</ref> He later married Mulgrew's widow.<ref>[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/edmund-hillary On top of the world: Ed Hillary] - '''Full biography''' of Edmund Hillary on NZHistory.net.nz</ref><ref>[http://www.nzedge.com/heroes/hillary.html NZEdge biography]</ref>

Hillary took part in the 1975 general election, as a member of the "High Commissioner to India (concurrently High Commissioner to Bangladesh and Ambassador to Nepal) and spent four and a half years based in New Delhi. In 1985 he accompanied Neil Armstrong in a small twin-engined ski plane over the Arctic Ocean and landed at the North Pole. He thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/2003/adventures/interview.html TIME: The Greatest Adventures of All Time - The Race to the Pole] (interview with Sir Edmund)</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/everest/story/0,,955942,00.html March 2003 interview with Hillary in] ''The Guardian''</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7180000/newsid_7184400/7184434.stm Video: Interview on HardTalk]</ref>

In January 2007, Hillary travelled to Antarctica to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of Scott Base. He flew to the station on 18 January 2007 with a delegation including the Prime Minister.

==Public recognition==

In 1992 Hillary appeared on the updated New Zealand $5 note, thus making him the only New Zealander to appear on a banknote during his or her lifetime, in defiance of the established convention for banknotes of using only depictions of deceased individuals, and current heads of state.  The Reserve Bank governor at the time, Don Brash, had originally intended to use a deceased sportsperson on the $5 note but could not find a suitable candidate.  Instead he broke with convention by requesting and receiving Hillary's permission &mdash; along with an insistence from Hillary to use Aoraki/Mount Cook rather than Mount Everest in the backdrop.  The image also features a Ferguson TE20 tractor like the one Hillary used to reach the South Pole on the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/4352295a26512.html "Face on a Banknote a Break with Convention"], ''The Dominion Post'', 12 January 2008, accessed 13 January 2008.</ref>

To mark the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of Everest the Nepalese Government conferred honorary citizenship upon Hillary at a special Golden Jubilee celebration in Kathmandu. He was the first foreign national to receive such an honour from the Nepalese government.<ref>[http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/content.php?nid=34096 Mountaineering Great Edmund Hillary passes away] Jan. 12, 2008 The Rising Nepal</ref>
