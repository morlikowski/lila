'''Marcionism''' is the dualist belief system that originates in the teachings of Marcion of Sinope at Rome around the year 144.<ref>(115 years and 6 months from the Crucifixion, according to Tertullian's reckoning in ''Adversus Marcionem'', xv)</ref> Marcion affirmed Jesus Christ as the savior sent by God and Paul as his chief apostle, but he rejected the Hebrew Bible and Yahweh. Marcionists believed that the wrathful Hebrew God was a separate and lower entity than the all-forgiving God of the New Testament. This belief was in some ways similar to Gnostic Christian theology, but in other ways quite different and unique.

Marcionism was denounced by its opponents as Church.  Marcion's writings are lost, though they were widely read and numerous manuscripts must have existed.  Even so, many scholars (including Henry Wace) claim it is possible to reconstruct and deduce a large part of ancient Marcionism through what later critics, especially Tertullian, said concerning Marcion.

==History==

According to Tertullian and other writers of the mainstream Church, the movement known as Marcionism began with the teachings and excommunication of Marcion from the Church of Rome around 144.  Marcion was reportedly a wealthy shipowner, the son of a bishop of Sinope of Pontus, Asia Minor. He arrived in Rome circa 140, soon after Bar Kokhba's revolt.  That revolution, along with other Jewish-Roman wars (the Great Jewish Revolt and the Kitos War), provides some of the historical context of the founding of Marcionism. Marcion was excommunicated from the Roman Church because he was threatening to make schisms in the church.<ref>[http://www.gnosis.org/library/marcion/Mead.htm Mead 1931, pp.241-249]</ref>

Marcion used his personal wealth, (particularly a donation returned to him by the Church of Rome after he was excommunicated), to fund an ecclesiastical organization. Marcionism continued in the West for 300 years, although Marcionistic ideas persisted much longer.<ref>[http://www.berdyaev.com/berdiaev/berd_lib/1928_336.html Berdyaev Online Library]</ref>

The organization continued in the East for some centuries later, particularly outside the Mani is believed to have been a Mandaean, and Mandaeanism is related to Marcionism in several ways.  For example, both Mandaeanism and Marcionism are characterized by a belief in a Demiurge.  The Marcionite organization itself is today extinct, although Mandaeanism is not.<ref>[http://www.mandaeans.org/ Mandaean Official Site]</ref>

==Teachings==
Marcion declared that Christianity was distinct from and in opposition to Judaism. He rejected the entire Hebrew Bible, and declared that the God of the Hebrew Bible was a lesser ''demiurge'', who had created the earth, but was (''de facto'') the source of evil. 

The premise of Marcionism is that many of the teachings of Christ are incompatible with the actions of Pauline traditions of the Gospel, Marcion felt that all other conceptions of the Gospel, and especially any association with the Old Testament religion, was opposed to, and a backsliding from, the truth. He further regarded the arguments of Paul regarding Marcion's version of Luke, and that the Marcionites attributed to Paul, that was different in a number of ways from the version that is now regarded as canonical.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3827/Library.html Center for Marcionite Research] presentation of ''The Gospel of Marcion''</ref>  It seems to have lacked all prophecies of Christ's coming, as well as the Infancy account, the baptism, and the verses were more terse in general. It also included ten of the New Testament canon on record, which he called the Gospel and the Apostolikon, which reflects his belief the writings reflect the apostle Paul and Jesus.

Marcionites hold maltheistic views of the god of the Hebrew Bible (known to some Gnostics as Monad to reveal the truth about existence, and thus allowing humanity to escape the earthly trap of the demiurge. Marcion called God, the Stranger God, or the Alien God, in some translations, as this deity had not had any previous interactions with the world, and was wholly unknown.

==Related systems==
In various popular sources, Marcion is often reckoned among the Valentinianism in silent contempt; but he could not refuse to discuss the question raised by Marcion, whether there is such opposition between different parts of what he regards as the word of God, that all cannot come from the same author." A primary difference between Marcionites and Gnostics was that the Gnostics based their theology on ''secret wisdom'' (as, for example, Theudas who received it direct from Paul) of which they claimed to be in possession, whereas Marcion based his theology on the contents of the Letters of Paul and the recorded sayings of Jesus &mdash; in other words, an argument from scripture, with Marcion defining what was and was not scripture. Also, the Docetic, denying the human nature of Christ. This may have been due to the unwillingness of Marcionites to believe that Jesus was the son of both God the Father and the demiurge. Classical Gnosticism, by contrast, held that Jesus was the son of both, even having a natural human father; that he was both the Messiah of Judaism and the world Savior.  Scholars of Early Christianity disagree on whether to classify Marcion as a Gnostic: Adolf Von Harnack does not classify Marcion as a Gnostic<ref>[http://www.webcom.com/gnosis/library/marcion/Harnack.html Article on Adolf Von Harnack]</ref>, whereas G. R. S. Mead does. Von Harnack argued that Marcion was not a Gnostic in the strict sense because Marcion rejected elaborate creation myths, and did not claim to have special revelation or secret knowledge. Mead claimed Marcionism makes certain points of contact with Gnosticism in its view that the creator of the material world is not the true deity, rejection of materialism and affirmation of a transcedent, purely good spiritual realm in opposition to the evil physical realm, the belief Jesus was sent by the "True" God to save humanity, the central role of Jesus in revealing the requirements of salvation, the belief Paul had a special place in the transmission of this "wisdom", and its docetism. According to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica article on [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/MAL_MAR/MARCION.html Marcion]:

Marcionism shows the influence of Scripture of their own, thus eventually producing the current canon of the New Testament. "As for the main question, however, whether he knew of, or assumes the existence of, a written New Testament of the Church in any sense whatever, in this case an affirmatory answer is most improbable, because if this were so he would have been compelled to make a direct attack upon the New Testament of the Church, and if such an attack had been made we should have heard of it from Tertullian. Marcion, on the contrary, treats the Catholic Church as one that 'follows the Testament of the Creator-God,' and directs the full force of his attack against this Testament and against the falsification of the Gospel and of the Pauline Epistles. His polemic would necessarily have been much less simple if he had been opposed to a Church which, by possessing a New Testament side by side with the Old Testament, had ''ipso facto'' placed the latter under the shelter of the former. In fact Marcion’s position towards the Catholic Church is intelligible, in the full force of its simplicity, only under the supposition that the Church had not yet in her hand any 'litera scripta ''Novi Testamenti''.'"<ref>Harnack, ''Origin of the New Testament'', appendix 6, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/origin_nt.v.vi.html#v.vi-Page_222 pp. 222-23]</ref>

==Recent scholarship==

In New Testament canon is discussed as pivotal, and the first to explicitly state it. There were early Christian groups, such as the Ebionites, that did not accept Paul as part of their canon.

Robert M. Price, a New Testament scholar at Drew University, considers the Pauline canon problem<ref>[http://depts.drew.edu/jhc/Rpcanon.html ''The Evolution of the Pauline Canon'' by Robert Price]</ref>: how, when, and who collected Paul's epistles to the various churches as a single collection of epistles. The evidence that the early church fathers, such as Clement, knew of the Pauline epistles is unclear. Price investigates several historical scenarios and comes to the conclusion and identifies Marcion as the first person known in recorded history to collect Paul's writings to various churches together as a canon, the Pauline epistles. Robert Price summarizes, "But the first collector of the Pauline Epistles had been Marcion. No one else we know of would be a good candidate, certainly not the essentially fictive Luke, Timothy, and Onesimus. And Marcion, as Burkitt and Bauer show, fills the bill perfectly."<ref>Price</ref> If this is correct, then Marcion's role in the formation and development of Christianity is pivotal.

==Criticisms==

According to a remark by Origen (''Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew'' 15.3), Marcion "prohibited allegorical interpretations of the scripture". Tertullian disputed this in his treatise against Marcion, as did Henry Wace: 

<blockquote>The story proceeds to say that he asked the Roman presbyters to explain the texts, "A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit," and "No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment," texts from which he himself deduced that works in which evil is to be found could not proceed from the good God, and that the Christian dispensation could have nothing in common with the Jewish. Rejecting the explanation offered him by the presbyters, he broke off the interview with a threat to make a schism in their church.<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/info/marcion-wace.html Wace's article on Marcion]</ref></blockquote>

Tertullian, along with Luke alone<ref>From the perspectives of Tertullian and Epiphanius (when the four gospels had largely canonical status, perhaps in reaction to the challenge created by Marcion), it appeared that Marcion rejected the non-Lukan gospels, however, in Marcion's time, it may be that the only gospel he was familiar with from Pontus was the gospel that would later be called Luke. It is also possible that Marcion's gospel was actually modified by his critics to became the gospel we know today as Luke, rather than the story from his critics that he changed a canonical gospel to get his version. For example, compare Luke 5:39 to 5:36-38, did Marcion delete 5:39 from his Gospel or was it added later to counteract a Marcionist interpretation of 5:36-38? One must keep in mind that we only know of Marcion through his critics and they considered him a major threat to the form of Christianity that they knew. John Knox (the modern writer, not to be confused with new wine in old wineskins)<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/articles/evans_marc/evans_marc_10book4_eng.htm Tertullian "Against Marcion" 4.11.9]</ref>, in theorizing that Marcion set about to recover the authentic teachings of Jesus. Against Heresies'', [http://ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/anf01-58.htm#P6650_1591742 1.27.3]</ref> Tertullian also attacked this view in ''De Carne Christi''.

'''Markionizmas''' – ankstyvosios Romoje pradėjo filosofas Markionas, mokęs, kad žydų Dievas Senajame Testamente skyrėsi nuo krikščionių Dievo Naujajame Testamente. Katalikų bažnyčios markionizmas buvo paskelbtas šėtono tarnu, o Tertulianas jį griežtai kritikavo. Tertulianas apie 202 m. parašė prieš markionizmą nukreiptą penkių knygų veikalą ''Adversus Marcionem''. Paties Markiono veikalai nėra išlikę, tačiau panašu, kad jų būta nemažai ir jie plačiai skaityti. Markionizmo teiginiai rekonstruojami pagal jo kritikų, visų pirma Tertuliano, darbuose esančius markionizmo teiginių apibūdinimus.

Markionizmo pradžia galima laikyti Markiono ekskomunikavimą, kurį paskelbė Romos bažnyčia apie 144 m. Markionizmas nealegoriškai traktavo Senojo Testamento teiginius. Dėl to buvo prieita išvados, kad žydų Dievas kūrėjas yra žiaurus, o Jėzus pats yra meilė. Jėzus teigė, kad yra Dievo sūnus, dėl to jis galėjo būti tik kito Dievo, o ne biblinio Dievo kūrėjo sūnus. Jėzus, Markiono manymu, turėjo būti gerojo Dievo sūnus, o Senajame Testamente minimas Dievas esąs senasis piktas Dievas.

Tarp biblinės krikščionybės požiūriu klaidingų jo teiginių buvo ir tokie:
* kad Kristus nebuvo gimęs iš Marijos ir neturėjo tikro kūno, kadangi kūnas yra blogis;
* neigė kūniškąjį prisikėlimą;
* atmetė visą Senąjį Testamentą;
* atmetė žydiškas Naujojo Testamento knygas (Apaštalų darbus, Laišką Žydams);
* didžiąją Naujojo Testamento dalį iškarpė taip, kad buvo palikta tik Evangelijos pagal Luką dalis ir 10 Pauliaus laiškų.

Markionizmas paskatino Bažnyčios Tėvus spręsti klausimą dėl raštų įkvėptumo ir oficialiai pripažinti kanonines Naujojo Testamento knygas.
