'''''Syberia II''''' is a 2004 third-person puzzle-solving game. Stylistically identical to the first ''Syberia'', ''Syberia II'' improves upon the first game by introducing more realistic character animation. The game includes a recap of the first chapter, so therefore does not require the player to have experienced the first game.

Sokal's later adventure games, such as ''Paradise'' have no connections to ''Syberia'' but do use the same high quality artwork and a similar interface.

== Plot summary ==
''Syberia II'' continues the adventures of American lawyer Kate Walker from the first game as she abandons her increasingly stressful life in New York in order to accompany an eccentric inventor to a remote land in Russia known as Syberia where surviving remnants of prehistoric mammoths still live.

=== Romansburg ===
Kate begins at a small frontier town called Romansburg. With helpful instructions (but no real physical help) from Hans' automaton train engineer Oscar, Kate is able to wind and load the train with coal. However, Hans falls ill and must be treated before they continue.

From a little girl named Malka, Kate learns that the monks at the monastery on top of the nearby cliff can heal Hans. However, the old patriarch and his strict adherence to his personal rules forces Kate to jump through hoop after hoop just to get him to look at Hans. Worse still, the patriarch deems him a lost cause and figures that skipping straight to spiritual salvation is the best course of action. Kate learns from Hans about a friend of his at the monastery that knows Youkol medicine. Though this man has died since then, Kate obtains his notebook and makes an herbal candle to help Hans. The patriarch of the monks refuses to let them leave, but Kate improvises a sled from Hans' coffin to get him down the mountain.

Things go from bad to worse when Kate is asked to fix some mechanical automaton horses on Hans' behalf. Two thieves, Ivan and Igor, hijack the train while she works, intending to reach Syberia and make a profit from the mammoth ivory. Kate is able to follow them using a gangcar powered by a friendly animal called a youki, a cross between a seal and a bear.

=== Wilderness ===
Kate finally catches up with the train, but it collapses a bridge when it grinds to a halt, stranding Kate on the wrong side. Followed by the youki, which Kate names Youki, Kate works her way across a river, manages to avoid being eaten by a bear, and is reunited with her old friend Boris, whose flying wing crashes nearby. He lends Kate the use of the co-pilot ejection seat to launch her back to the train before Ivan and Igor can escape. Kate manages to make it to the train, but Ivan and Igor have given up on operating it and have left on a snowmobile with Hans as their prisoner. They are forced to unhinge the passenger car to pursue the kidnappers.

By the time they catch up, Ivan is off collecting ivory and the simple-minded Igor is having second-thoughts about the plan, as he is easily intimidated by the noise being made from wind blowing through a nearby statue. Hans has managed to escape his captors, but his whereabouts are as much of a mystery to Kate as they are to Igor. Kate stops the noise and convinces Igor to abandon Ivan. Kate confronts Ivan at a large mammoth statue surround by ivory. Ivan holds her at bay until she manages to convince Oscar to offer some assistance (blowing the train's horn) to create a momentary diversion. However, it doesn't completely succeed and Ivan is just about to do Kate in when the ice on which they are standing cracks, dropping Kate into darkness.

=== Youkol village ===
Kate awakes in the icy, underground village of the Youkol people. Hans is there, too, but he is on his deathbed. After convincing the Youkol people to help her drag the train inside, Kate makes her way to the shaman's hut. With the help of the shaman, Kate decides to reach Hans in his dreams and convince him to live.

In the dream, set in Valadilène, Kate makes her way to the Voralberg factory, meeting young Anna and Hans' strict father, who says that Hans is locked in the attic as punishment. Using the clock to convince him it's time for work, Kate sneaks into the attic to talk to Hans. She convinces Hans, who alternates between his child self and his present self, not to give up. In response, he asks her to help Oscar "open up his heart." He disappears, and Kate touches an object on the table which ends the dream. When Kate delivers the cryptic message to Oscar, the automaton engineer knows what he must do: he will give his "life" for his creator, unlocking his hollow body to form a primitive exo-skeleton/life-support system for Hans.
