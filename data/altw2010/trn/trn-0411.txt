'''''The Cry of Love''''' is a posthumous American guitarist Jimi Hendrix, released on March 5, 1971. It was the first Hendrix album released after his death and was engineered, mixed and compiled by Eddie Kramer and Mitch Mitchell.

The pairing of ''The Cry of Love'' with ''Rainbow Bridge'' comprises the bulk of the most complete tracks that Hendrix was intending to release on his next (double) LP, ''First Rays of the New Rising Sun''. All songs on the album were written by Hendrix and recorded throughout 1970, except surprise addition "My Friend", which was recorded in 1968.  Gers plays harp on "My Friend".

Mitchell and Kramer's involvement gave the album credibility, and it was well received by fans and critics alike. The album managed to reach #3 in the U.S. and #2 in the UK, and was regarded as the most accurate approximation of Hendrix's final album until ''Freedom" b/w "Angel" was released as a single in the U.S., but only reached #59. In the UK, "Angel" b/w "Night Bird Flying" was the single released, though it did not manage to enter the charts. All of the songs from ''The Cry of Love'' are featured on the 1997 compilation ''First Rays of the New Rising Sun''.

The song "My Friend" was recorded during the early stages of the ''Electric Ladyland'' sessions in 1968. It is a humorously delivered, but ultimately serious, song about loneliness. It features a dubbed background of Hendrix and friends creating a busy bar atmosphere. This dubbed audience idea also ended up being used in the 15-minute blues song "Voodoo Chile". The final track on the album, "Belly Button Window", was Jimi's last studio recording with vocals. It was recorded at Electric Lady Studios on August 22, 1970.
