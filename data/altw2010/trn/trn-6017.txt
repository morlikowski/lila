'''ガネーシャ''' ('''&#x0917;&#x0923;&#x0947;&#x0936;''', ''gaNeza'') は、ヒンドゥー教の神の一柱。その名はサンスクリットで「群衆(ガナ)の主(イーシャ)」を意味する。同じ意味で'''ガナパティ''' ('''&#x0917;&#x0923;&#x092a;&#x0924;&#x93f;''', ''gaNapati'') とも呼ばれる。

また現代ヒンディー語では短母音の/a/が落ち、同じデーヴァナーガリー綴りでもガネーシュ、ガンパティ（ガンパチ）などと発音される。英語風に訛ればガーネッシュ (Ganesh) などともなる。

太鼓腹の人間の身体に 片方の象の頭をもった神で、4本の腕をもつ。障害を取り去り、また財産をもたらすと言われ、商業の神・学問の神とされる。インドのマハラシュトラ州を中心にデカン高原一帯で多く信仰されている。

ヒンドゥー教の体系の中では、シヴァとパールヴァティーの間に生まれた子供である。しかし、これはシヴァ系の宗教が独立したガネーシャ系の宗教を取り込んだ際の解釈だと思われる。現在でもガネーシャはシヴァ系のヒンドゥー教の一部である。

== 神話 ==
パールヴァティーが身体を洗って、その身体の汚れを集めて人形を作り命を吹き込んで自分の子供を生んだ。
パールヴァティーの命令で、ガネーシャが浴室の見張りをしている際に、シヴァが帰還した。ガネーシャはそれを父、あるいは偉大な神シヴァとは知らず、入室を拒んだ。シヴァは激怒しガネーシャの首を切り落とし遠くへ投げ捨てることになる。

パールヴァティーに会い、それが自分の子供だと知ったシヴァは、投げ捨てたガネーシャの頭を探しに西に向かって旅に出かけるが、見つけることができなかった。そこで旅の最初に出会った象の首を切り落として持ち帰り、ガネーシャの頭として取り付け復活させた。これが、ガネーシャが象の頭を持っている所以とされる。

== 仏教圏での信仰 ==
日本の仏教では、歓喜天（聖天）と呼ばれ仏（ほとけ）のひとりとして含まれている。（cf.仏の一覧）

スリランカ仏教では'''ナラギリ'''（Naragiri）という象の悪魔にされている。

==その他==
衆議院議員選挙で教団の音楽には『ガネーシャ体操』なるものもある。

K. ": The Idea and the Icon" in  </ref>  His popularity rose quickly, and he was formally included among the five primary deities of Smartism (a Hindu denomination) in the 9th century.

== Etymology and other names ==
thumb|right|Ganesha as 'Shri Mayureshwar' with consorts Buddhi and Siddhi, [[Ganesha Temple at Morgaon|Morgaon (the central shrine for the regional  complex)<ref>Courtright, pp. 212–213.</ref>]]

Ganesh has many other titles and epithets, including ''Ganapati'' and ''Vigneshvara''. The Hindu title of respect ''Shri'' (Sanskrit: ; , also spelled ''Sri'' or ''Shree'') is often added before his name.  One popular way Ganesha is worshipped is by  chanting a ''Ganesha Sahasranama'', a litany of "a thousand names of Ganesha". Each name in the sahasranama conveys a different meaning and symbolises a different aspect of Ganesha. At least two different versions of the Ganesha Sahasranama exist; one version is drawn from the ''Ganesha Purana'', a Hindu scripture venerating Ganesha.<ref>For an English translation of ''Ganesha Purana'' 1.46, see: Bailey, pp. 258–269.</ref> 

The name ''Ganesha'' is a Sanskrit compound, joining the words ''gana'' (Sanskrit: ; ''''), meaning a group, multitude, or categorical system and ''isha'' (Sanskrit: ; ''''), meaning lord or master.<ref> See:
* Narain, A. K. ": A Protohistory of the Idea and the Icon". Brown, pp. 21–22.
* Apte, p. 395.</ref>  The word ''gaņa'' when associated with Ganesha is often taken to refer to the gaņas, a troop of semi-divine beings that form part of the retinue of Amarakośa'',<ref> See:
*  for source text of  1.38 as .
*  for text of '''' versified as 1.1.38. </ref> an early Sanskrit lexicon, lists eight synonyms of ''Ganesha'' : ''Vinayaka'', '''' (equivalent to ''Vignesha''), '''' (one who has two mothers),<ref> Y. Krishan (:Unravelling an Enigma, p.6): "Pārvati who created an image of  out of her bodily impurities but which became endowed with life after immersion in the sacred waters of the Gangā. Therefore he is said to have two mothers--Pārvati and Gangā and hence called dvaimātura and also Gāngeya."</ref> '''' (equivalent to ''Ganapati'' and ''Ganesha''), ''Ekadanta'' (one who has one tusk), ''Heramba'', ''Lambodara'' (one who has a pot belly, or, literally, one who has a hanging belly), and ''Gajanana'' (IAST: ) ; having the face of an elephant).<ref>Krishan p.6</ref> 

''Vinayaka'' (''.<ref>For the history of the  sites and a description of pilgrimage practices related to them, see: Mate, pp. 1–25.</ref>  The names  ''Vignesha'' (Sanskrit: ; ) and ''Vigneshvara'' (Sanskrit: विघ्नेश्वर; ) (Lord of Obstacles)<ref name = "Vignesha"/> refers to his primary function in Hindu mythology as the creator and remover of obstacles ('''').<ref name = "Krishanvii">For Krishan's views on Ganesha's dual nature see his quote: " has a dual nature; as Vināyaka, as a '''', he is '''', and as  he is '''', a ''''." Krishan, p. viii.</ref>  

A prominent name for Ganesha in the Tamil language is ''Pille'' or ''Pillaiyar'' (Little Child).<ref>Martin-Dubost, p. 367.</ref> A. K. Narain differentiates these terms by saying that ''pille'' means a "child" while ''pillaiyar'' means a "noble child". He adds that the words ''pallu'', ''pella'', and ''pell'' in the Dravidian family of languages signify "tooth or tusk of an elephant", but more generally "elephant".<ref>Narain, A. K. ": The Idea and the Icon". Brown, p. 25.</ref> Anita Raina Thapan notes that the root word ''pille'' in the name ''Pillaiyar'' might have originally meant "the young of the elephant", because the Pali word ''pillaka'' means "a young elephant".<ref>Thapan, p. 62.</ref>

==Iconography==

right|thumb|This statue of Ganesha was created in the [[Mysore District of Karnataka in the 13th century.]]

Ganesha is a popular figure in Indian art.<ref>Pal, p. ix.</ref> Unlike those of some deities, representations of Ganesha show wide variations and distinct patterns changing over time.<ref> See:
* Martin-Dubost, for a comprehensive review of iconography abundantly illustrated with pictures.
* Chapter X, "Development of the Iconography of ", in: , for a survey of iconography with emphasis on developmental themes, well-illustrated with plates.
* Pal, for a richly illustrated collection of studies on specific aspects of Ganesha with a focus on art and iconography. </ref> He may be portrayed standing, dancing, heroically taking action against demons, playing with his family as a boy, sitting down, or engaging in a range of contemporary situations.  

Ganesha images were prevalent in many parts of goad in one upper arm and a noose in the other upper arm.  

The influence of this old constellation of iconographic elements can still be seen in contemporary representations of Ganesha. In one modern form, the only variation from these old elements is that the lower-right hand does not hold the broken tusk but rather is turned toward the viewer in a gesture of protection or fearlessness (abhaya mudra).<ref>See:
* Martin-Dubost, pp. 197–198.

===Common attributes===

For this image see: Martin-Dubost (1997), p. 64, which describes it as follows: "On a terrace leaning against a thick white bolster,  is seated on a bed of pink lotus petals arranged on a low seat to the back of which is fixed a parasol. The elephant-faced god, with his body entirely red, is dressed in a yellow Heramba-Ganapati'', has five elephant heads, and other less-common variations in the number of heads are known.<ref>Nagar, p. 78.</ref> While some texts say that Ganesha was born with an elephant head, in most stories he acquires the head later.<ref>Brown, p. 76.</ref> The most recurrent motif in these stories is that Ganesha was born with a human head and body and that Shiva beheaded him when Ganesha came between Shiva and Parvati. Shiva then replaced Ganesha's original head with that of an elephant.<ref>Brown, p. 77.</ref>  Details of the battle and where the replacement head came from vary according to different sources.<ref>Brown, pp. 77–78.</ref> In another story, when Ganesha was born, his mother, Parvati, showed off her new baby to the other gods.  Unfortunately, the god Shani (Saturn), who is said to have the evil eye, looked at him, causing the baby's head to be burned to ashes.  The god Vishnu came to the rescue and replaced the missing head with that of an elephant.<ref>Brown, pp. 76–77.</ref>  Another story says that Ganesha was created directly by Shiva's laughter. Because Shiva considered Ganesha too alluring, he gave him the head of an elephant and a protruding belly.<ref>For creation of Ganesha from Shiva's laughter and subsequent curse by Shiva, see ''Varaha Purana'' 23.17 as cited in Brown: p. 77.</ref>

Ganesha's earliest name was ''Ekadanta'' (One Tusk), referring to his single whole tusk, the other having been broken off.<ref>Getty, p. 1.</ref> Some of the earliest images of Ganesha show him holding his broken tusk.<ref>Heras, p. 29.</ref> The importance of this distinctive feature is reflected in the ''incarnation is Ekadanta.<ref>Granoff, Phyllis. " as Metaphor". Brown, p. 90.</ref> Ganesha's protruding belly appears as a distinctive attribute in his earliest statuary, which dates to the Gupta period (fourth to sixth centuries).<ref>"Ganesha in Indian Plastic Art" and ''Passim''. Nagar, p. 101.</ref> This feature is so important that, according to the ''Mudgala Purana'', two different incarnations of Ganesha use names based on it: ''Lambodara'' (Pot Belly, or, literally, Hanging Belly) and ''Mahodara'' (Great Belly).<ref>Granoff, Phyllis. " as Metaphor". Brown, p. 91.</ref>  Both names are Sanskrit compounds describing his belly (Sanskrit: '''').<ref>For translation of ''udara'' as "belly" see: Apte, p. 268.</ref> The ''Brahmanda Purana'' says that Ganesha has the name Lambodara because all the universes (i.e., cosmic eggs; IAST: '''') of the past, present, and future are present in him.<ref> See:

Specific colors are associated with certain forms.<ref>"The Colors of Ganesha". Martin-Dubost, pp. 221–230.</ref>  Many examples of color associations with specific meditation forms are prescribed in the Sritattvanidhi, a treatise on Hindu iconography. For example, white is associated with his representations as ''Heramba-Ganapati'' <!-- TRANSLATION? -->and ''Rina-Mochana-Ganapati'' (Ganapati Who Releases from Bondage).<ref>Martin-Dubost, pp. 224–228</ref>  ''Ekadanta-Ganapati'' is visualized as blue during meditation on that form.<ref>Martin-Dubost, p. 228.</ref>

===Vahanas===

The earliest Ganesha images are without a the eight incarnations of Ganesha described in the ''Mudgala Purana'', Ganesha has a mouse in five of them, uses a lion in his incarnation as ''Vakratunda'', a peacock in his incarnation of ''Vikata'', and four incarnations of Ganesha listed in the ''Ganesha Purana'', ''Mohotkata'' has a lion, '''' has a peacock, ''Dhumraketu'' has a horse, and ''Gajanana'' has a rat.<ref>See:

thumb|right|Ganesha riding on his mouse. A sculpture at the Vaidyeshwara temple in Talakkadu, [[Karnataka, India. Note the red flowers offered by devotees.]]

Ganesha is often shown riding on or attended by a mouse or rat.<ref>See:
* Nagar. Preface.
* Martin-Dubost, pp. 231–244.</ref> Martin-Dubost says that the rat began to appear as the principal vehicle in sculptures of Ganesha in central and western India during the 7th century; the rat was always placed close to his feet.<ref>See note on figure 43 in: Martin-Dubost, p. 144.</ref> The mouse as a mount first appears in written sources in the ''Matsya Purana'' and later in the ''Brahmananda Purana'' and ''Ganesha Purana'', where Ganesha uses it as his vehicle only in his last incarnation.<ref>Citations to ''Matsya Purana'' 260.54, ''Brahmananda Purana Lalitamahatmya'' XXVII, and ''Ganesha Purana'' 2.134–136 are provided by: Martin-Dubost, p. 231.</ref>  The Ganapati Atharvashirsa includes a meditation verse on Ganesha that describes the mouse appearing on his flag.<ref>Martin-Dubost, p. 232.</ref> The names '''' (mouse-mount) and '''' (rat-banner) appear in the ''Ganesha Sahasranama''.<ref>For  see v. 6. For Ākhuketana see v. 67. In: ''''. (, 1991). Source text with a commentary by  in Sanskrit.</ref>

The mouse is interpreted in several ways. According to Grimes, "Many, if not most of those who interpret 's mouse, do so negatively; it symbolizes '''' as well as desire".<ref>For a review of different interpretations, and quotation, see: Grimes (1995), p. 86.</ref>  Along these lines, Michael Wilcockson says it symbolizes those who wish to overcome desires and be less selfish.<ref>''A Student's Guide to AS Religious Studies for the OCR Specification,'' by Michael Wilcockson, pg.117</ref> Krishan notes that the rat is destructive and a menace to crops.  The Sanskrit word '''' (mouse) is derived from the root '''' (stealing, robbing).  It was essential to subdue the rat as a destructive pest, a type of ''vighna'' (impediment) that needed to be overcome.  According to this theory, showing Ganesha as master of the rat demonstrates his function as ''Vigneshvara'' (Lord of Obstacles) and gives evidence of his possible role as a folk ''grāmata-devatā'' (village deity) who later rose to greater prominence.<ref>Krishan pp. 49–50.</ref> Martin-Dubost notes a view that the rat is a symbol suggesting that Ganesha, like the rat, penetrates even the most secret places.<ref> See:
* Martin-Dubost, p. 231.
* Rocher, Ludo. "'s Rise to Prominence in Sanskrit Literature", in: Brown (1991), p. 73. For mention of the interpretation that "the rat is 'the animal that finds its way to every place,'"</ref>

==Associations==
===Obstacles===

Ganesha is ''Vighneshvara'' or ''Vighnaraja'', the Lord of Obstacles, both of a material and spiritual order.<ref>"Lord of Obstacles", a common name, appears in the title of Courtright's '': Lord of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings''. For equivalent Sanskrit names ''Vighneśvara'' and ''Vighnarāja'', see: Courtright, p. 136.</ref> He is popularly worshipped as a remover of obstacles, though traditionally he also places obstacles in the path of those who need to be checked. Paul Courtright says that "his task in the divine scheme of things, his ''dharma'', is to place and remove obstacles. It is his particular territory, the reason for his creation."<ref>Courtright, p. 136.</ref>
thumb|left|A modern illustration of Ganesha
Krishan notes that some of Ganesha's names reflect shadings of multiple roles that have evolved over time.<ref name = "Krishanvii"/> Dhavalikar ascribes the quick ascension of Ganesha in the Hindu pantheon, and the emergence of the , to this shift in emphasis from '''' (obstacle-creator) to '''' (obstacle-averter).<ref>For Dhavilkar's views on Ganesha's shifting role, see Dhavalikar, M. K. ": Myth and reality" in </ref> However, both functions continue to be vital to his character, as Robert Brown explains, "even after the  is well-defined, in art  remained predominantly important for his dual role as creator and remover of obstacles, thus having both a negative and a positive aspect".<ref>Brown, p. 6.</ref>

=== Buddhi ===

Ganesha is considered to be the Lord of letters and learning.<ref>Nagar, p. 5.</ref>  In Sanskrit, the word ''buddhi'' is a feminine noun that is variously translated as intelligence, wisdom, or intellect.<ref>Apte, p. 703.</ref>  The concept of buddhi is closely associated with the personality of Ganesha, especially in the Puranic period, when many stories stress his cleverness and love of intelligence.  One of Ganesha's names in the ''Ganesha Purana'' and the ''Ganesha Sahasranama'' is ''Buddhipriya''.<ref>''Ganesha Purana'' I.46, v. 5 of the Ganesha Sahasranama section in GP-1993, Sharma edition. It appears in verse 10 of the version as given in the Bhaskararaya commentary.</ref> This name also appears in a list of 21 names at the end of the ''Ganesha Sahasranama'' that Ganesha says are especially important.<ref>Sharma edition, GP-1993 I.46, verses 204–206. The Bailey edition uses a variant text, and where Sharma reads ''Buddhipriya'', Bailey translates ''Granter-of-lakhs.''</ref>  The word ''priya'' can mean "fond of", and in a marital context it can mean "lover" or "husband",<ref> Practical Sanskrit Dictionary By Arthur Anthony MacDonell; p.187 (''priya''); Published 2004; Motilal Banarsidass Publ; ISBN 8120820002</ref> so the name may mean either "Fond of Intelligence" or "Buddhi's Husband".<ref> Krishan 1999; pp. 60-70 discusses Ganesha as "Buddhi's Husband".</ref>

===Aum===

Ganesha is identified with the Hindu mantra Aum (, also called ''Om'').  The term '''' (Aum is his form), when identified with Ganesha, refers to the notion that he personifies the primal sound.<ref>Grimes, p. 77.</ref> The ''Ganapati Atharvashirsa'' attests to this association. Chinmayananda translates the relevant passage as follows:

<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">(O Lord Ganapati!) You are (the Trinity) Mahesa. You are <nowiki>]</nowiki>. You are the sun <nowiki>[</nowiki><nowiki>]</nowiki> and the moon <nowiki>[</nowiki>Chandrama<nowiki>].</nowiki> You are Brahman. You are (the three worlds) Bhuloka [earth], Antariksha-loka [space], and Swargaloka [heaven]. You are Om. (That is to say, You are all this).<ref>Chinmayananda, p. 127. In Chinmayananda's numbering system, this is ''upamantra'' 8.</ref></blockquote>

thumb|right|Ganesha ([[Devanagari) Aum jewel]]
Some devotees see similarities between the shape of Ganesha's body in iconography and the shape of Aum in the Devanāgarī and Tamil scripts.<ref>For examples of both, see: Grimes, pp. 79–80.</ref>

===First chakra===

According to . ''Mula'' means "original, main"; ''adhara'' means "base, foundation". The muladhara chakra is the principle on which the manifestation or outward expansion of primordial Divine Force rests.<ref name = "T83"> Tantra Unveiled: Seducing the Forces of Matter & Spirit By Rajmani Tigunait; Contributor Deborah Willoughby ; Published 1999; Himalayan Institute Press; p. 83; ISBN 0893891584 </ref> This association is also attested to in the ''Ganapati Atharvashirsa''. Courtright translates this passage as follows: "[O Ganesha,] You continually dwell in the sacral plexus at the base of the spine []."<ref>Translation. Courtright, p. 253.</ref> Thus, Ganesha has a permanent abode in every being at the Muladhara.<ref>Chinmayananda, op. cit., p. 127.  In Chinmayananda's numbering system this is part of ''upamantra'' 7. 'You have a permanent abode (in every being) at the place called "Muladhara"'.</ref> Ganesha holds, supports and guides all other chakras, thereby "governing the forces that propel the wheel of life".<ref name = "T83"/>

Though Ganesha is popularly held to be the son of Puranic myths disagree about his birth.<ref> See:

The family includes his brother Skanda, who is also called Karttikeya, Murugan, and other names.<ref>For a summary of variant names for Skanda, see: Thapan, p. 300.</ref> Regional differences dictate the order of their births. In northern India, Skanda is generally said to be the elder, while in the south, Ganesha is considered the first born.<ref>Khokar and Saraswati, p.4.</ref> Skanda was an important martial deity from about 500 BCE to about 600 CE, when worship of him declined significantly in northern India. As Skanda fell, Ganesha rose. Several stories tell of sibling rivalry between the brothers<ref>Brown, p. 4, 79.</ref> and may reflect sectarian tensions.<ref>Gupta, p. 38.</ref>  

Ganesha's marital status, the subject of considerable scholarly review, varies widely in mythological stories.<ref name="lawrence_cohen">For a review, see: Cohen, Lawrence. "The Wives of ". Brown, pp. 115–140</ref>  One pattern of myths identifies Ganesha as an unmarried ''brahmacārin''.<ref> See:
* . "According to ancient tradition,  was a , that is, an unmarried deity; but legend gave him two consorts, personifications of Wisdom (Buddhi) and Success (Siddhi)."
* . "... in the '''' or orthodox traditional religious beliefs,  is a bachelor or ''''" </ref> This view is common in southern India and parts of northern India.<ref>For discussion on celibacy of Ganesha, see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of ", in: .</ref> Another pattern associates him with the concepts of ''Buddhi'' (intellect), ''Siddhi'' (spiritual power), and ''Riddhi'' (prosperity); these qualities are sometimes personified as goddesses, said to be Ganesha's wives.<ref>For a review of associations with Buddhi, Siddhi, Riddhi, and other figures, and the statement "In short the spouses of  are the personifications of his powers, manifesting his functional features...", see: .</ref> He also may be shown with a single consort or a nameless servant (Sanskrit: '''').<ref>For single consort or a nameless '''' (servant), see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of ", in: .</ref> Another pattern connects Ganesha with the goddess of culture and the arts, Sarasvati or  (particularly in Maharashtra).<ref>For associations with Śarda and Sarasvati and the identification of those goddesses with one another, see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of ", in: .</ref>  He is also associated with the goddess of luck and prosperity, Lakshmi.<ref>For associations with Lakshmi see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of ", in: . </ref> Another pattern, mainly prevalent in the Bengal region, links Ganesha with the banana tree, Kala Bo.<ref>For discussion of the Kala Bo, see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of ", in: .</ref> 

The ''Santoshi Ma, the goddess of satisfaction. This story has no Puranic basis, but Anita Raina Thapan and Lawrence Cohen cite Santoshi Ma's cult as evidence of Ganesha's continuing evolution as a popular deity.<ref> See:

==Worship and festivals==

Ganesha is worshipped on many religious and secular occasions;  especially at the beginning of ventures such as buying a vehicle or starting a business.<ref>Krishan pp.1-3</ref> K.N. Somayaji says, "there can hardly be a [Hindu] home [in India] which does not house an idol of Ganapati. [..] Ganapati, being the most popular deity in India, is worshipped by almost all castes and in all parts of the country".<ref> K.N. Somayaji, ''Concept of Ganesha'', p.1 as quoted in Krishan pp.2-3</ref> Devotees believe that if Ganesha is propitiated, he grants success, prosperity and protection against adversity.<ref>Krishan p.38</ref>

Ganesha is a non-sectarian deity, and Hindus of all denominations invoke him at the beginning of prayers, important undertakings, and religious ceremonies.<ref>For worship of Ganesha by "followers of all sects and denominations, Saivites, Vaisnavites, Buddhists and Jainas" see </ref> Dancers and musicians, particularly in southern India, begin performances of arts such as the Bharatnatyam dance with a prayer to Ganesha.<ref>Nagar, Preface.</ref>  Mantras such as  ''Om Shri  Namah'' (Om, salutation to the Illustrious Ganesha) are often used. One of the most famous mantras associated with Ganesha is ''Om  Ganapataye Namah'' (Om, , Salutation to the Lord of Hosts).<ref>Grimes p.27</ref>

Devotees offer Ganesha sweets such as modaka and small sweet balls (laddus).<ref>The term ''modaka'' applies to all regional varieties of cakes or sweets offered to Ganesha. Martin-Dubost, p. 204.</ref>  He is often shown carrying a bowl of sweets, called a ''''.<ref>Martin-Dubost, p. 204.</ref> Because of his identification with the color red, he is often worshipped with red sandalwood paste ()<ref>Martin-Dubost, p. 369.</ref> or red flowers.  grass (''Cynodon dactylon'') and other materials are also used in his worship.<ref>Martin-Dubost, pp. 95–99.</ref> 

Festivals associated with Ganesh are "the Vināyaka ''caturthī'' (Ganesh Chaturthi) in the '''' (the fourth day of the waxing moon) in the month of ''bhādrapada'' (August/September) and the  ''jayanti'' ('s birthday) celebrated on the ''cathurthī'' of the '''' (fourth day of the waning moon) in the month of ''māgha'' (January/February)."<ref>Thapan p.215</ref>

===Ganesh Chaturthi===

An annual festival honours Ganesha for ten days, starting on Ganesh Chaturthi, which typically falls in late August or early September.<ref>For the fourth waxing day in  being dedicated to Ganesa () see: Bhattacharyya, B., "Festivals and Sacred Days", in: Bhattacharyya, volume IV, p. 483.</ref> The festival culminates on the day of Ananta Chaturdashi, when images (''murtis'') of Ganesha are immersed in the most convenient body of water.<ref> ''The Experience of Hinduism: Essays on Religion in Maharashtra'' ; Edited By Eleanor Zelliot, Maxine Berntsen, pp.76-94 ("The Ganesh Festival in Maharashtra: Some Observations" by Paul B. Courtright); Published 1988; SUNY Press; ISBN 088706664X </ref> In 1893, Lokmanya Tilak transformed this annual Ganesha festival from private family celebrations into a grand public event.<ref>Metcalf and Metcalf, p. 150.</ref> He did so "to bridge the gap between the Brahmins and the non-Brahmins and find an appropriate context in which to build a new grassroots unity between them" in his nationalistic strivings against the British in Maharashtra.<ref> See:
* Brown (1991), p. 9.
* Thapan, p. 225. For Tilak's role in converting the private family festivals to a public event in support of Indian nationalism.</ref>  Because of Ganesha's wide appeal as "the god for Everyman", Tilak chose him as a rallying point for Indian protest against British rule.<ref> See:
* Momin, A. R., ''The Legacy Of G. S. Ghurye: A Centennial Festschrift'', p. 95.
* Brown (1991), p. 9. For Ganesha's appeal as "the god for Everyman" as a motivation for Tilak. </ref> Tilak was the first to install large public images of Ganesha in pavilions, and he established the practice of submerging all the public images on the tenth day.<ref>For Tilak as the first to use large public images in '''' (pavilions or tents) see: Thapan, p. 225.</ref>
Today, Hindus across India celebrate the Ganapati festival with great fervour, though it is most popular in the state of Maharashtra.<ref>For Ganesh Chaturthi as the most popular festival in Maharashtra, see: Thapan, p. 226.</ref><ref>" in a Regional Setting". Courtright, pp. 202–247.</ref>  The festival also assumes huge proportions in Mumbai and in the surrounding belt of Ashtavinayaka temples.
