'''艾因哈德（Einhard）'''，法兰克王国史学家，“卡洛林文艺复兴”的代表人物之一。

==生平==
出生于法兰克东部的莫因格维，家境殷实。779年，9岁的他被送进查理宫中供职，受到阿尔昆的教益，成为卡洛林文艺复兴的后起之秀。

794年当上了查理的侍从秘书，并参预机要。查理死后，他继续留在其子虔诚者路易的宫廷，恩宠不衰。830年，由于他不愿意卷入路易的3个儿子之间的混战，毅然离开了宫廷，来到他自己创建的塞利根施塔特修道院隐居，潜心著述，直至840年3月14曰去世。 

他曾破例同时兼领过几个修道院的院长职务，这原是教会宗规所不容许的事情。

==《查理大帝传》==

艾因哈德流传下来五种著作，其中以《查理大帝传》（Vita Karoli Magni or Life of Charlemagne ）最有价值。此书在写作上模仿了古罗马史学家苏埃托尼乌斯的《十二凯撒传》的文风。艾因哈德在自序中说道：“我认为没有人能够比我更真实地记述这些事情，而且我也不能肯定有没有别人会写出它们。”

《查理大帝传》写成后，获得很高声誉，是这一历史时期最重要的史料。同时代人瓦拉夫里德·斯特拉博也称赞它“提供了丝毫不假的真情实况”。有人夸奖它的优雅文笔直逼古典作家。该书从中世纪流传下来的手抄本，多达六十部。

'''Einhard''' (also '''Eginhard''' or '''Einhart''') (c. 775 &ndash; Frankish courtier, a dedicated servant of Charlemagne, of whom he wrote his famous biography, and Louis the Pious.

Einhard wrote a number of works, the most famous of which was produced at the request of Charlemagne's son and successor Lives of the Caesars''. His work was written as a praise of Charlemagne, whom he regarded as a foster-father and to whom he was a debtor "in life and death". The work thus contains an understandable degree of bias, Einhard taking care to exculpate Charlemagne in some matters, not mention others, and to gloss over certain issues which would be of embarrassment to Charlemagne, such as the morality of his daughters. However, it appears to be a fairly accurate description of events.

Einhard was from the eastern, German speaking part of the Frankish kingdom. He was educated at scholarly men around him and established a royal school led by the Northumbrian scholar Aachen and court during the time of the disputes between Louis and his sons in the spring of 830. 

==Local lore==

Local lore from Seligenstadt portrays Einhard as the lover of Emma, one of Charlemagne's daughters, and has the couple elope from court. Charlemagne found them at Seligenstadt (then called Obermühlheim) and forgave them. This account is used to explain the name "Seligenstadt" by a folk etymology. The story has been popularised by poet Wilhelm Busch.<ref>[http://www7.hr-online.de/website/rubriken/freizeit/index.jsp?rubrik=4346&key=standard_document_914328 Spessart: Der hessische Spessart | Freizeit | hr<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
