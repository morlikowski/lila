The '''Alfa Romeo 308''' or '''8C-308''' is a Grand Prix racing car made for the 3 litre class in 1938, only four cars was produced, actually modified from Tipo C with the engine mounted lower into the chassis and a slimer body.<ref name="borg"></ref> <ref name="venables"></ref>The chassis was derived from the Tipo C and the engine from the  8C 2900. The 308 was engineered by 312 (3-litre, 12 cylindres) and 316 (3-litre, 16 cylindres) were entered, but the later hit engine troubles in practice and Clemente Biondetti took the start at the wheel of the 308 hold in reserve. He failed to finish while Hermann Lang driving a Mercedes-Benz W154 was the winner. In this race Eugenio Siena driving a 312 was killed after hitting a wall.

In the 1938 2900B.<ref name=MM> Title:"Classic and Sportscar" magazine, Published: April 2007, Article: "Alfa 8C-2900B MM", Page 192, ISSN </ref>

In 1938 and 1939 Raymond Sommer managed to win a couple of hillclimb competitions at La Turbie with 308<ref name="ddavid.com/formula1"></ref> and in the 1940s Jean-Pierre Wimille won a couple of races in Europe. One of the cars was brought to Argentina where it gathered some success and victories in the hands of Oscar Alfredo Gálvez. The car that Gálvez used in Argentina is now in the Juan-Manuel Fangio museum.[http://www.jmfangio.org/museo_alfa8c308.htm]

One of the cars was sold to USA after World War II and Louis Durant drove it to 6th place in 1946 Indianapolis 500, next year it placed 7th with Walt Brown. In 1948 Johnny Mauro drove the car to 8th place, this car is now located in Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum,<ref name="coloradoracingmemories.com"></ref> probably it is the same car that was also used in Indianapolis in 1940, which was Raymond Sommer's ex car.<ref name="kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman"></ref>   

Overall Alfa Romeo's 3 litre formula cars (Tipo 308, 312 and 316) were not a great success. Instead, the new car for the 1500 cc class, the 158 voiturette, designed in 1937 and first raced at the Coppa Ciano in August 1938, proved much more successful.
