'''Sixtus IV''' (Michelangelo's frescoes were added in a later phase).

==Biography==
He was born to a modest family near Republic of Genoa. He joined the Franciscan Order, an unlikely choice for a political career, and his intellectual qualities were revealed while he was studying Cardinal by Pope Paul II (1464&ndash;1471).

With his election to pope, Sixtus IV declared a renewed Greek Church. For the remainder of his pontificate he turned to temporal issues and dynastic considerations. Sixtus continued the dispute with Louis XI of France (1461&ndash;1483), who upheld the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges (1438), according to which papal decrees needed royal assent before they could be promulgated in France. This was a cornerstone of the privileges claimed for the Gallican Church and could never be shifted as long as Louis XI maneuvered to replace Ferdinand I of Naples with a French prince, thus being in conflict with the papacy, which as a princely strategist could not permit it.

Like a number of Popes, Sixtus IV adhered to the system of Platina, author of the first humanist history of the Popes. His nephew Pietro Riario also benefited of his nepotism, becoming one of the richest men in Rome and being entrusted of Sixtus IV's foreign policy, but died prematurely in 1474, his role passing to Giuliano della Rovere.

The secular fortunes of the Della Rovere began when Sixtus invested his nephew Giovanni with the ''signoria'' of Francesco Maria to Federico's successor Guidobaldo (Duke of Urbino 1482&ndash;1508) who, without an heir, devised the duchy on the boy.</ref>   

In his territorial aggrandizement of the "Pazzi conspiracy" to assassinate both Girolamo Riario. Francesco Salviati, interdict and two years' of war with Florence. He also encouraged the Venetians to attack Ferrara, which he wished to obtain for another nephew. The angered Italian princes allied to force Sixtus IV to make peace, to his great annoyance.

As a temporal prince who constructed stout fortresses in the Venice's aggression against Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, inciting the Venetians to attack in 1482 in the so-called War of Ferrara. Their combined assault was opposed by an alliance of the Sforzas of Milan, the Medicis of Florence along with the King of Naples, normally a hereditary ally and champion of the Papacy. For refusing to desist from the very hostilities that he himself had instigated (and for being a dangerous rival to Della Rovere dynastic ambitions in the Marche), Sixtus IV placed Venice under interdict in 1483.

Sixtus IV consented to the bull in Ferdinand of Aragon, who threatened to withhold military support from his kingdom of Virgin Mary. He formally annulled (1478) the confusedly reformist decrees of the Council of Constance.

Sixtus IV is one of several Popes suspected of being homosexual. <ref>http://books.google.com/books?lr=&ei=CWUPSMLhGKDsygTH0ti9Ag&output=html&as_brr=1&id=BM6DAz1tefoC&jtp=21</ref> The basis of this being the diary records of Stefano Infessura (1440-1500) who recorded documented episodes and unsubstantiated rumours. This included accusations that Sixtus had awarded benefices and bishoprics in return for sexual favours. It is clear though that Sixtus rather favoured his relatives instead in order to have faithful executors of policy. However an exception was Giovanni Sclafenato, who was created a cardinal according to the papal epitaph on his tomb for "ingenuousness, loyalty and his others gifts of soul and body". Later accusations of sodomy by protestants can be dismissed as propaganda.

==Princely patronage==

As a civic patron in Rome, even the anti-papal chronicler Trevi..." In addition to restoring the aqueduct that provided Rome an alternative to the river water that had made the city famously unhealthy, he restored or rebuilt over 30 of Rome's dilapidated churches, among them San Vitale (Borgo with the heart of old Rome. This was part of a broader scheme of Campidoglio in 1477 and decreed in a bull of 1480 the widening of streets and the first post-Roman paving, the removal of porticoes and other post-classical impediments to free public passage.

At the beginning of his papacy in 1471, Sixtus IV donated several historically important Roman sculptures that founded a papal collection of art that would eventually develop into the collections of the Capitoline Museums. He also refounded, enriched and enlarged the Vatican Library. He had Regiomontanus attempt the first sanctioned reorganization of the Julian calendar and increased the size and prestige of the papal chapel choir, bringing singers and some prominent composers (Gaspar van Weerbeke, Marbrianus de Orto, and Bertrandus Vaqueras) to Rome from the North.
