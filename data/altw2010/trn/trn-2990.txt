'''Flipper''' is an influential San Francisco, California, formed in 1979, continuing in often erratic fashion until the mid-1990s, then reuniting in 2005.

===Initial impact===
Flipper was founded by former members of the Sleepers and Negative Trend. Founding member and original vocalist Ricky Williams was fired from the band before any recordings were made because he was deemed too messed up to remain in the band. The name is often seen to be a reference to thalidomide babies, such as the one featured on the cover of their early "Love Canal" single <ref>[http://devildick.blogspot.com/2008/01/flipper-love-canal-ha-ha-ha.html "Love Canal album cover"].  January 29th, 2008.</ref>. It could also be a refence to a song on the french band Téléphone's first album (The fact that Flipper released a song named "Telephone" on ''American Grafishy'' seems to support this.)

Flipper made their first recordings available in late 1979 via the ''SF Underground'' 7" compilation series released through Steve Tupper's newly-formed Subterranean Records. In 1981, a 7" comprising "Love Canal/Ha Ha Ha" followed, and the original lineup made two full-length studio albums on Subterranean, 1982's ''Generic'' and a 1984 follow up ''Gone Fishin<nowiki>'</nowiki>''.

Flipper's music was very shambolic and noisy, and often considered "slow" for a punk band of the time. In many early shows, the band had half the audience on stage with them singing backup vocals, and encouraged horn players to join them for their anthem, "Sex Bomb"; the crowding on stage usually knocked the stringed instruments out of tune. Guitarist Ted Falconi installed spikes in the head of his guitar to help prevent this, but blaring, out-of-tune dissonance became part of the band's signature sound.

Flipper was often as strongly in league with conceptual art and atonal music as with rock or punk. Years after the band's demise, its spray-painted dead fish logos were still visible in San Francisco (although signs on the city's Clipper Street have since been reverted from "Flipper Street").

Some  say that Flipper's charm as a band lies in their ability to upset audiences, while attracting their undivided attention and curiosity at the same time. Their first single, "Love Canal"/"Ha Ha Ha", was widely derided, not only for its offensive cover art, but its bizarre sound, and yet sold many copies in the underground. "Ha Ha Ha" was also considered by some to be derivative of "Lifetime Problems," the b-side of The Dicks' single "Dicks Hate the Police," which had caused a big stir the previous year. This, in brief, was the band's concept: ''to be bad in ways that no band had ever been bad before''. However, in true Flipper fashion, they even failed to fail, and their audience continued to grow as their outlandish approach appealed to those seeking something different.

Two more singles on Subterranean followed, "Brainwash"/"Sex Bomb Baby" and "Old Lady That Swallowed The Fly"/"Get Away" before ''Album'' (also known as ''Generic Flipper''). Their debut LP sees the drone and blare molded into startlingly effective songs, with a lyrically bleak outlook, but humane vulnerability in the vocals, and flashes of genuine musicianship. It is widely considered a classic album of this era. The mayhem contained on the disc is infectious as Will Shatter repeats "Life! Life! Life is the only thing worth living for!" Similarly, "Sex Bomb Baby" is a seven minute track with only one lyric, "She's a sex bomb, my baby, yeah.", intertwined with a raucous yet melodic musical interplay. 

The follow-up studio album in 1984, ''Gone Fishin'', was even darker and artier than the first LP. It featured the disorientating opening track "The Lights, The Sound, The Rhythm, The Noise", the haunting "Survivors of the Plague" and the decrying of the war machine in the song "Sacrifice". The multi-colored delivery step van pictured on the cover was also where Ted Falconi lived when the group was not on the road.  The van, along with figures representing the band and their equipment could be cut out and folded with Subterranean offering extra covers through a small mail order fee.

In 1984, the ROIR cassette label released a live Flipper document of a CBGB's performance entitled "Blow'n Chunks" that became available on CD in 1990, and goes in and out of print. A 2001 reissue includes four outtakes from the live sessions. The performance included material from all phases of the band's existence thus far.

John Lydon's Public Image Ltd was widely accused in the U.S. of stealing the cover art and concept of Flipper's album, ''Album''. Consequently, Flipper entitled their 1986 double live album, ''Public Flipper Ltd.''  The album unfolded into a board game complete with a cutout spinner and game cards with Subterranean once again providing extra covers through mail order.

The original lineup began splintering after a long debauched period of touring, and singer and core member Will Shatter eventually died on December 9th, 1987 of a drug overdose after forming A3I (Any Three Initials, a punk outfit whose title mocked the prevalence of acronymic band names). Subterranean packaged the band's most popular recordings in a greatest hits collection titled "Sex Bomb Baby" released in 1987.  The initial release featured several different hand drawn covers and the cassette edition and later CD rerelease featured three bonus tracks.

===After Will Shatter===
By the early 1990s, the band resurfaced with a new single on Subterranean called "Someday"/"Distant Illusion" and began performing again, releasing an all-new studio album in 1993, ''American Grafishy''. Bruce Loose had become a heroin addict by this point. After Loose allegedly stole the band's master tapes from Subterranean's warehouse, he and DePace brokered a deal with powerful Los Angeles-based music industry figure Rick Rubin. Rubin used his attorneys to quash Subterranean's claim to the music and soon re-released ''Album Generic Flipper'' and the singles compilation ''Sex Bomb Baby'' on his Infinite Zero label. Even with Henry Rollins onboard as the latter label's A&R, the label soon went defunct. By 1997, Flipper's groundbreaking music went largely out of print, with Rubin still holding onto the rights, though tentative plans had been made for the band's catalogue to be re-released on Rubin's American Recordings in 2007.

As part of the legal settlement Subterranean Records was awarded the right to reissue its Flipper records on vinyl in the United States. 

The band continued playing from 1990 to 1995, pursuing a more straightforward rock sound and attempt to cash in on their notoriety. In 1992, the new lineup released "American Grafishy" on Def American imprint; this is their only recording that is still consistently (legally) available. Their demise was again forthcoming due to another death by heroin overdose, this time that of replacement bass player John Dougherty. 

Loose once commented to ''SF Weekly'' on the band's history as "like Spinal Tap, except the ''bass'' player keeps dying".

In 2002 Bruce Loose, father of a teenager, using a cane to get around (following a horrific car accident), resurfaced with a one off gig at Berkeley's 924 Gilman Street space as "Not Flipper". Falconi is somewhat reclusive. DePace is reportedly shopping Flipper stories to potential publishers. He lives in the L.A. area and works in the animation industry.

The original members of Flipper, barring the late Will Shatter (with Bruno DeSmartass replacing Shatter once again as he had done for a 1982 tour), reunited to support CBGB on August 22 and August 28, 2005. Singer Bruce Loose appeared on stage with a cane. This line-up of Flipper then continued to play live again beginning in 2006, with plans for a new album to be released and recorded in 2007.

==Premières années==
Créé par d'anciens membres des groupes punk SST, Sleepers et Negative Trend, Flipper enregistre à la fin de 1979 quelques pièces, qui seront disponibles sur les 7' SF Undeground, une série de compilations de Subterranean Records, un label formé par le chanteur Steve Tupper.

En 1981, Flipper lance son premier 7', ''Love Canal'' / ''Ha Ha Ha''. Suivront les "Brainwash"/"Sex Bomb Baby" et "Old Lady That Swallowed The Fly"/ "Get Away". Puis seront lancés sur Subterranean les deux albums complets: Album - Generic Flipper (en 1982) et Gone Fishin' (en 1985).

Parfois plus expérimental que punk rock selon les standards du genre, le but de Flipper était d'être mauvais d'une manière dont aucun groupe n'avait été mauvais auparavant. Même avec cet objectif en tête, on doit admettre qu'ils ont manqué leur coup puisque, malgré l'irritation et le mépris qu'il suscitait parfois, leur renommée allait sans cesse grandissante dans le milieu underground de San Francisco, puis parmi les groupes qui suivront.

Le style de punk préconisé par Flipper était joué de façon plus lente et plus lourde que la majorité des formations punk de l'époque, ce qui a eu une certaine influence sur la scène Nirvana fit plusieurs apparitions publiques et se laissa photographier à de nombreuses reprises avec un t-shirt de Flipper, ce qui a contribué à la renommée du groupe. De plus, The Melvins a lancé en 1990 un simple vinyle comprenant deux reprises de Flipper (''Love Canal'' / ''Someday'') et offert une version, en 1992, de la pièce ''Sacrifice'', sur leur album Lysol.

Flipper était reconnu pour laisser le public monter sur scène pendant ses spectacles. Certains fans prirent rapidement l'habitude de déranger les musiciens lorsqu'ils jouaient, ce qui désaccordait les instruments et contribuait encore davantage au son distortionné et expérimental du quatuor.

La réputation du groupe était de faire davantage d'auto-promotion que de musique véritable. Ils étaient reconnus à San Francisco pour peinturer la ville avec des graffitis de leur logo: un poisson mort. Des fans ont même transformé le signe ''Clipper Street'' en ''Flipper Street''. Certains logos sont toujours visibles dans ville, et des poissons morts peinturés sont apparus, avec les années, dans les toilettes du Vatican, sur le Mur de Berlin et sur la Grande Muraille de Chine!

En 1984, peu après la sortie de Gone Fishin' sur Subterranean, un label qui ne distribue que des cassettes audio, ROIR, rend disponible un enregistrement de Flipper au CD en 1990. Rapidement épuisé, il sera ré-imprimé en 2001.

John Lydon de Public Image Ltd. fut accusé d'avoir volé l'idée de la pochette du premier album de Flipper pour son propre groupe. En représailles, le quatuor californien baptise son double album live Public Flipper Limited en 1986.
