'''''Star Trek: Hidden Frontier''''' (HF) was a ''chroma keyed process to place performers into virtual settings.

The series is set during the era of the ''Briar Patch, a region of space introduced in the film ''Star Trek: Insurrection''.

''Hidden Frontier'' has produced 50 episodes, and focuses on character relationships, including, gay and lesbian characters and subplots.[http://www.afterelton.com/movies/2006/6/hidden.html 1]

Produced by Rob Caves, ''Hidden Frontier'' ran for seven seasons and was produced by volunteers in Southern California. The final episode of the series aired in May 2007. Two new spin-offs, ''Star Trek: Odyssey'' and ''Star Trek: The Helena Chronicles'', also produced by Rob Caves, take place shortly after the end of ''Hidden Frontier''.

==Plot==
Based in the Briar Patch (Tikrit Expanse) introduced in Star Trek: Insurrection, on Deep Space 12, a space station in orbit of the planet Ba'ku.  It follows the daily life of several officers serving onboard the station and a few of the ships stationed there.  Early in the series, an advanced species, the Grey, are introduced and become the primary villain, with a story arc that spans the entire series.  Later, secondary villains are introduced including an Andorian trader and later the Tholians along with a man named Siroc.  Mysterious ancient alien artifacts become a key focus of the series.

The crew interacts with many established species from Star Trek, including Andorians, Ba'ku, Klingons, Romulans, Son'a, and Tzenkethi.

==Background information==
''Star Trek: Hidden Frontier'' premiered in 2000, an offshoot of the fan series ''Voyages of the USS Angeles'', produced by the ''Star Trek'' fan club of that starship name in Southern California, and for legal reasons only circulated among the cast and crew; no copies of the earlier series are available to the public and no reference to the show is even made on the club's web site. Hidden Frontier inherited the setting, Deep Space 12, and several of the characters from the ''Angeles'' series, but quickly went on to establish its own identity. Two later HF episodes made use of footage originally shot for ''Angeles'' episodes that were never produced.

Because of the expense involved in building and storing the sets required for all the locations used in the series, the series is filmed in a spare room of the executive producer's home and utilizes a green screen matting technique to place actors into "virtual" sets.  As a result, there is often a slight green halo around the actors, which some viewers decry, while others apparently have little trouble with. And, while from a technique and technical standpoint the show is behind some other fan films, it shows how far fan film has come in that it is an amateur web based series, with a multi-arc plot and which manages to produce at least six episodes per year, whereas most fan films are either one-offs or are released at a much slower rate.

Because of the risk that the episodes are burnt to DVD and sold, endangering the legal position of the show's producers, most episodes are released in low resolution. At this point only five (originally six) episodes have been released in high quality, those being a special edition of Season 1's fourth episode, "Two Hours," Season 6's premiere and finale, "Countermeasures" and "Her Battle Lanterns Lit," (which is originally released both low and high resolutions, but it has been later regularized into a single regular episode) and also Season 7's premiere, "Heavy Losses" and the two-part series finale.

Several key roles had replacements during the seven year run. The character of Lefler was originally played by Kelly Jamison, but because of work obligations, she had to pass the role on to Joanne Busch. The character of Ro Nevin was originally played by Arthur Bosserman, but he decided to leave the cast after five seasons to pursue professional interests in music. The role was passed to Bobby Rice.

For Seasons 2 and 3, nine episodes were produced each season. The later seasons were reduced to six, as nine episodes were too much work for the volunteer cast and crew. Nonetheless, Season 7, the final season, consists of eight episodes.

''Hidden Frontier'''s theme music is taken from the film ''Galaxy Quest''. Because of the crew's short production schedule and low budget, the music for most of HF's episodes was inherited from Paramount-owned soundtracks (both ''Star Trek'' and non-''Star Trek''), possibly to confine copyright issues to a single studio which generally owns ''Star Trek'' properties. Original scores were created for the last four episodes, when several fans of the series, who were also composers, volunteered to create the music, and also to improve the series to become enjoyable and better.

'''Star Trek: Hidden Frontier''' ist eine Star-Trek-Fanfilm-Reihe, die auf den Ereignissen des neunten Star-Trek-Kinofilms ''Star Trek: Der Aufstand'' basiert. Mit 50 Episoden in sieben Jahren ist sie eine der am längsten laufenden Internet-Projekte.

Alle nicht an realen Orten spielenden Szenen wurden mittels der Green-Screen-Technik gefilmt und mit Standbildern der Serien oder selbst erschaffenen Hintergründen kombiniert. Die Weltraumszenen wurden durch selbstproduzierte ''Computer Generated Imagery''-Effekte (CGI) erschaffen.

Obwohl nicht dem offiziellen Franchise angehörig, wurde die Serie mehrmals auf der offiziellen Star-Trek-Homepage thematisiert. Zudem halfen diverse Presseartikel, den Bekanntheitsgrad der Serie zu steigern. <ref>[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-trek7jul07,0,5370738.story?coll=la-home-center ''Los Angeles Times vom 07.

Seit September 2007 werden alle Episoden mit optionalen deutschen Untertiteln zum Download angeboten.

== Handlung ==

Ort der Handlung ist hauptsächlich die im ''Briar's Patch'' gelegene Raumstation ''Deep Space 12'' sowie das dort eingesetzte Raumschiff ''U.S.S. Excelsior''. Neben einem alle Episoden überdauernden Handlungsbogen um die Bedrohung der Föderation durch die bislang unbekannten ''Grey'' beschäftigt sich die Serie auch mit den vielschichtigen Beziehungen der Charaktere untereinander. Dabei wird erstmals in der, wenn auch nicht offiziellen, Star-Trek-Geschichte auf homosexuelle Beziehungen eingegangen.
Obwohl der Großteil der Personen neu in die Handlung eingeführt wird, entwickelt die Serie auch bereits etablierte Charaktere weiter.
