'''Empress Xiao Zhe Yi''' (Chinese: 孝哲毅皇后阿鲁特氏) Chinese: 嘉顺皇后), was the Empress Consort of the Tong Zhi Emperor of China. Empress Xiao Zhe Yi came from the Mongol Alute clan, and she was considered as one of the most talented and tragic Empresses of the Qing Dynasty of China.

==Biography==
=== Childhood and Marriage to the Tong Zhi Emperor===
As a teenager, Alute was highly talented at poetry, literature, music, and painting. She was from a highly cultivated family. Her father Chong Ji (Chinese: 崇绮), an intelligent and well-cultivated man who ranked first in the classical Chinese test of scholars, served in the Qing Imperial Court. He tutored Alute when she was young. Record shows that the Alute demonstrated high potentials and intelligence as a child. She could read "ten lines at a glance", and possessed both beauty and high morality. Influenced by her father, Alute learned to write with both hands aptly, and became famous among the Manchu aristocracy.

On September 15 1872, Alute was chosen as the Empress Consort by the Tongzhi Emperor. Shortly before that event, there had been a conflict between the two Dowager Empresses, Ci'an and Cixi, on the issue of the selection of Empress. Ci'an, who favoured the Jia Shun Empress, argued that an Empress should most importantly possess high moral standards, while Empress Dowager Cixi argued that an Empress should be wise and shrewd. Alute's maternal grandfather (a brother of the late Daoguang Emperor) was an enemy of Empress Dowager Cixi in the past. However, the conflict was resolved by the Tongzhi Emperor, who gave his words of choosing Alute as his Empress. Empress Dowager Cixi was very displeased at Alute's victory since the beginning.

=== Married life ===

After his marriage, the Tongzhi Emperor clearly favored the Empress Consort Alute and ignored his four Imperial Consorts. They spent every night together, while the Imperial Consorts spent weeks and months waiting for the Emperor to summon them. Empress Dowager Cixi, who grew angrier about the unfair treatment of the Emperor's wives, became very hostile to Empress Consort Alute. She warned that an Empress Consort should allow an Emperor to share his favor equally among his wives and not seize him alone. Also, she reminded Empress Alute that both she and Emperor Tongzhi were still young and should spend more energy learning how to manage their country. When she still saw no signs of change in the attitude of Emperor Tongzhi, Empress Dowager Cixi finally ordered the Emperor and the Empress to separate, and continue single-handedly on their study and preparation of becoming ruling sovereigns.

However, Emperor Tongzhi, who could no longer cope with his grievance and loneliness, grew more and more ill-tempered. Eventually, a palace eunuch secretly urged the Emperor to visit brothels located outside the Forbidden city. As a result, it was assumed he caught "Hua-Liu" 花柳病, a sexually transmitted disease. Empress Dowager Cixi regarded this as a humiliating scandal and warned the imperial doctors to have their mouths sealed. The doctors produced a lie that the Emperor caught smallpox, and gave medicines and treatments according to smallpox. The Emperor died within a few weeks.

===Death of the Jia Shun Empress===

'''孝哲毅皇后'''〔载淳大两岁，同治十一年九月十四立为皇后。据传说，在选立皇-{后}-时，慈禧太后意在凤秀之女，慈安意在崇绮之女。同治皇帝遵从了慈安的意向，选中了阿鲁特氏。因此，从立-{后}-的那一天起，慈禧就不喜欢阿鲁特氏。后来又见载淳与皇-{后}-感情甚密，相敬如宾，而被封为慧妃的凤秀之女常被冷落，慈禧更加愤怒，经常干预帝-{后}-的私生活，所以野史中才有阿鲁特氏被慈禧迫害致死的说法。

载淳駕崩后，因入繼大統的光緒帝為同治平輩，故阿魯特氏只能稱皇后而非皇太后，徽號嘉顺皇后。阿鲁特氏死后，梓宫也在隆福寺暂安，光绪五年三月二十六与载淳同日入葬惠陵。她的谥号全称是：“'''孝哲嘉顺淑慎贤明恭端宪天彰圣毅皇后'''”。

== 野史記載 ==
同治帝死於天花後，皇后阿鲁特氏當時已懷孕，慈禧太后為保住皇太后地位〔要是阿鲁特氏誕下兒子，她就會成為皇太后，而升等成為太皇太后的慈禧，將會被逼退到幕後，因此政權將會落在阿鲁特氏手中。〕，便逼迫她仰藥自盡。

此外還有一個傳說；

有天慈禧太后正因小事而責罰阿魯特氏時，命太監掌嘴，掌嘴是清宮中對女性最低賤的懲罰，連宮女都未必會被掌嘴，因此皇后阿魯特氏為此向慈禧太后求情道；「臣妾就算犯了什麼大罪，好歹也是從大清門抬進宮來的啊！請皇太后為臣妾連點顏面吧！」
