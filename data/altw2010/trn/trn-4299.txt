New York City grew in importance as a trading port while under British rule. The city hosted the seminal John Peter Zenger trial in 1735, helping to establish the freedom of the press in North America.  In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by George II of Great Britain as King's College in Lower Manhattan.<ref></ref> The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October of 1765. 

The city emerged as the theater for a series of major battles known as the New York Campaign during the American Revolutionary War. After the Battle of Fort Washington in upper Manhattan in 1776 the city became the British military and political base of operations in North America until military occupation ended in 1783.  The assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City the national capital shortly thereafter; the Constitution of the United States was ratified and in 1789 the first President of the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated there; the first United States Congress assembled for the first time in 1789, and the United States Bill of Rights drafted; all at Federal Hall on Wall Street.<ref></ref> By 1790, New York City had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States.

Much of New York is built on the three islands of Manhattan, Staten Island, and Long Island, making land scarce and encouraging a high population density.

The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary.<ref></ref> The Hudson separates the city from New Jersey. The East River, actually a tidal strait, flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates Manhattan from the Bronx.

The city's land has been altered considerably by human intervention, with substantial Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="gillespie-p71"></ref> Some of the natural variations in topography have been evened out, particularly in Manhattan.<ref></ref>

The New York City area has a distinctive regional speech pattern called the New York dialect, alternatively known as Brooklynese or New Yorkese. It is often considered to be one of the most recognizable accents within American English.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005) "New York Talk" in ''American Voices'' Walt Wolfram and Ben Ward (eds). p.82-87 Blackwell ISBN 1-4051-2109-2</ref> The classic version of this dialect is centered on middle and working class people of European American descent, and the influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect.<ref name=NYT19930214/>

The traditional New York area accent is non-rhotic, so that the sound  does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant; hence the pronunciation of the city as "New Yawk."<ref name=NYT19930214/> There is no  in words like ''park''  (with vowel raised due to the low-back chain shift), ''butter'' , or ''here'' . In another feature called the low back chain shift, the  vowel sound of words like ''talk'', ''law'', ''cross'', and ''coffee'' and the often homophonous  in ''core'' and ''more'' are tensed and usually raised more than in General American.

In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like "girl" and of words like "oil" both become a diphthong . This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the ''er'' and ''oy'' sounds, so that ''girl'' is pronounced "goil" and ''oil'' is pronounced "erl"; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like "Joizey" (Jersey), "Toidy-Toid Street" (33rd St.) and "terlet" (toilet).<ref name=NYT19930214/> The character sitcom ''All in the Family'' was a good example of a speaker who had this feature. This particular speech pattern is no longer very prevalent.<ref name=NYT19930214>Sontag, Deborah. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0D61438F937A25751C0A965958260 "Oy Gevalt!

'''纽约市'''（简称'''纽约'''，，官方名稱為）是全球化的城市，并在全球范围内直接影響着时尚界。最大城市及第一大港，也是世界第五大城市，位於美國東北部，斯塔滕岛區等五个区。

== 概况 ==
纽约市座落在一个拥有2200万人口、世界上最大的都會區之一：大纽约都會區的心脏地带，是國際級的經濟、金融、交通、藝術及傳媒中心，更被視為都市文明的代表。此外也由於联合国总部設於該市，因此又被世人譽為「世界首都」。纽约市还是众多世界级博物馆、画廊和演艺比赛场地的所在地，使其成为西半球的文化及娱乐中心之一。由于在二十世紀初，紐約對外來移民來說是個嶄新天地，機會處處，因此紐約常被暱称为「大苹果」（the Big Apple），便是取「好看、好吃，人人都想咬一口」之意。也因此，紐約有着超过八百万人口（生活在309平方英里的土地上），和来自180多个国家的大量移民。除了这些海外移民外，这个城市又是许多希望体验一个比美国其它地方更加国际化的生活方式的外地美国人的家。紐約對全球的影響力亦十分大,又是世界傳媒，金融，銀行和政治（因為世界上最大的國際組織-聯合國的總部都設在紐約）中心。此外，紐約也是著全球金融中心之一。華爾街對世界經濟有重大影響力，常有人說：「華爾街咳嗽，全世界發燒。」，就是比喻華爾街對世界經濟的強大影響力。

==历史==
thumb|200px|紐約市的[[天際線]]
right|200px|thumb|纽约市政厅

在查理二世的弟弟詹姆士。荷蘭人後於1673年8月收復此殖民地，給城市改名"新奥兰治"（New Orange），然後在1674年11月此殖民地就永久地被割讓給英國。

英國重奪此殖民地後，把它再次更名為'''紐約市'''（City of New York），並且把它包圍著，不許它發展，終於New York Campaign爆發，這是美國革命戰爭早期的一系列的主要爭鬥，以後，紐約市一直續繼被英國管理，直到戰爭結束，是最後一個英國搬離的港口。

根據美國憲法大會，1788年9月13日，紐約市曾是新形成的美國的臨時首都，直到1790年。1825年伊利運河開始運作，紐約市的經濟亦有所增長，成為一個經濟中心。

美國內戰期間，紐約市有不少動亂和混亂的情況出現，如紐約黑幫（Gangs Of New York），和1863年的紐約徵兵暴動等等。其中一些成了美國史上傷亡最慘重的暴動。

1904年，紐約市的一系列新運輸系統一一開始運作，最著名的有紐約地鐵，它們幫助鞏固紐約市。歐洲的大量移民為社會帶來大變動，而反資本主義的工會'''IWW'''（Industrial Workers of the World）則被抑制了。後來， 在1920年代，大量非裔美國人從美國南部遷移至紐約市，而一些人則協助建造摩天大樓，創造了曼哈頓那聞名全球的天際線。

大萧条期間，紐約市亦遭受波及，第二次世界大戰時，紐約市亦起了重大的作用。

自兩次世界大戰以後，紐約市成了主導世界的城市，但1950年起，紐約市經濟開始衰落，只剩下工業和商業，70年代期間，紐約市的犯罪率上漲到了危險程度，因而成為了惡名昭彰的犯罪之都，但自朱利安尼上任後，大幅改善了紐約的治安。

2001年9月11日，恐怖分子攻擊世界貿易中心，幾乎有3000人遇害。當中有世貿的工作人員，二架商業噴射飛機上的乘客，和上百名消防員、警察和急救隊員。

== 地理 ==
纽约市处于纽约州东南部。由於面積廣大，又分為五個區域，分別是曼哈頓，皇后區，布魯克林區，布朗克斯區，史泰登島區。其中曼哈頓，皇-{后}-區，布魯克林區和布朗斯區的大眾交通運輸系統有紐約地鐵。

== 人口==
在非裔26.59%、亚裔9.83%、与13.42%其他人种、和4.92%多人种/混血种。每家庭大约有3.32人。 

纽约市平均人均收入/年是22,402美元。

==交通==

thumb|right|275px|[[甘迺迪國際機場不僅是大紐約地區主要的國際機場，亦為美國東北部重要的進出大門，更是攸關美國經濟的空運樞紐。]]
紐約市為美國最大、最擁擠的城市，亦為世界上最大的大型都會區所在，因此該市的交通流量十分龐大。每逢尖峰時段或假日，經常會有大量人潮、車潮流動於市中心曼哈頓內或五大區之間，經常導致市區內各重要幹道及重要的連外橋樑，出現交通阻塞的情形。

紐約市與其周邊地區的交通流量龐大，因此以紐約市為中心的新澤西州、與地鐵及MetroCard，係紐約市政府為了推廣大眾捷運交通而實施的乘客優惠制度。由於這項改革使紐約地鐵與公車間的轉乘更為方便，因此廣受市民及遊客歡迎。在1997年該卡當發行不久時，紐約大眾運輸系統的乘客人數就已經達到了2700萬人次。

此外，由於紐約市境內河流港灣錯綜複雜，因此橋樑及隧道數量眾多，是其一大特色。這些橋樑及隧道對紐約的發展貢獻甚鉅，尤對四面環水的曼哈頓島來說更是如此，因為橋樑是民眾往來市中心（即曼哈頓）及郊區間的必經通道，隧道亦然。但每逢上下班尖峰時刻，橋樑和隧道反而變成了交通瓶頸。

除了都會區內交通發達之外，紐約市與全美各地的往來亦十分頻繁，透過發達、複雜的鐵公路網，紐約居民得以更快速、方便的往返全國各座都市。此外紐約也由於地處美國東北部，距離歐洲也較近，又接近全球最繁忙的北大西洋航線，故不論是與歐洲各地間的空運及海運交通，均十分繁忙。

== 文化 ==
由于纽约市种族文化较多，纽约市综合文化是非常丰富的。
