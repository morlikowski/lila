후터스 걸(Hooters Girls)은 후터스 레스토랑 체인에서 근무하는 웨이트리스를 가리키는 말이다. 후터스 공식 홈페이지에 의하면 후터스 걸은 치어리더의 이미지를 차용했다. 그래서 후터스에서는 각종 스포츠 경기장에 후터스 걸을 보내 응원하며 한국에서도 잠실 야구장에서 프로 야구 경기가 있을 때 후터스 걸을 만날 수 있다[http://www.heraldbiz.com/SITE/data/html_dir/2007/05/11/200705110005.asp]. 최근에 최홍만의 K-1 응원 이벤트를 기획했으나 취소되었다. 

'''채용에 관련된 이야기'''

후터스 걸로 선발되면 서비스 및 소양교육은 물론 영어 교육과 매년 라스베거스에서 열리는 '미스 후터스걸 인터내셔널 선발대회'에
참여한다고 한다. [http://www.hooterskorea.co.kr/employ/girl.asp] 

미국 후터스 홈페이지에 따르면, 후터스 걸의 섹스어필에 대한 논란이 있지만, 이는 정치적 올바름을 지향하는 일부 단체에 의한 주장이고, 후터스에서는 여성의 여성으로서의 성적 매력을 발산하는 것을 여성의 권리로 받아들이고 그것을 존중하는 입장에서 후터스 걸의 복장과 이미지를 형성하고 있다고 한다. 미국에서는 여성만 후터스 걸로 채용하는 데 대한 법률 분쟁이 제기되기도 했다.[http://www.hooters.com/company/about_hooters/]

'''Hooters''' is the trade name of two privately held American restaurant chains: Hooters of America, Incorporated, based in Atlanta, Georgia, and Hooters, Incorporated, based in Clearwater, Florida.

Hooters targets male customers with a serving staff comprising only waitresses, although Hooters does employ males as cooks, hosts (at some franchises), busboys, and managers. The menu includes hamburgers and other sandwiches, steaks,  seafood entrees, appetizers, and the restaurant's specialty, chicken wings . Almost all Hooters  hold alcoholic beverage licenses to sell beer and wine, and where local permits allow, many offer a full liquor bar. Ancillary offerings for sale include T-shirts and various souvenirs and curios. 

Between company owned locations and franchises, there are now more than 435 Hooters restaurants in 46 U.S. states and 23 other countries,<ref>[http://www.hooters.com/company/did_you_know/ Hooters Facts]</ref> including Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Israel, Mexico, Guatemala, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Croatia, Chile, Australia, Panama, Costa Rica, China, South Korea, Greece, Venezuela, Spain, Switzerland, and Singapore - its first overseas location to open. Hooters plans to open its first branch in Dubai and Guam in 2008.<ref>[http://www.gulfnews.com/nation/Society/10133712.html Hooters to open in Dubai] Gulf News</ref>  A Hooters was opened in St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands in December 2007.<ref>[http://www.onepaper.com/stthomasvi/?v=d&i=&s=News:Local&p=1201845002 Hooters Opens Tuesday at Buccaneer Mall] St. Thomas Source</ref>

==History==
Hooters, Inc. began operations on October 4, 1983 with a restaurant in Clearwater, Florida. (Although a reference to "a building that allegedly was previously a walk-in dumpster called Fernando's Dumpster, Inc." appears in the Hooters menu, it is false. The Original Hooters took the place of a failed seafood restaurant. In fact, so many businesses had failed in that particular location that Hooters' founders built a small "graveyard" at the front door for each of the businesses that had come before them.) <ref>http://www.originalhooters.com/saga.cfm?pg=1983</ref>

In 1984, Robert H. Brooks and a group of Atlanta investors (operators of Hooters of America, Inc.) bought expansion and franchise rights for the Hooters chain. In 2002, Brooks bought majority control and became chairman.<ref name=OriginalHooters2002></ref> The Clearwater-based company retained control over restaurants in the Tampa Bay Area, Chicagoland, and one in Manhattan, New York,<ref name=OriginalHootersLoc></ref> while all other locations were under the aegis of Hooters of America, which sold franchising rights to the rest of the United States and international locations.<ref name=HOAhistory></ref> Under Brooks's leadership, the collective Hooters brand expanded from one restaurant to more than 425 stores worldwide. Brooks died in July 2006 of a heart attack.<ref name=Hooters2007></ref>

The Paradise, Tropicana and across the street from the MGM Grand Las Vegas. It is the only "Hooters"-branded operation that is not operated by Hooters of America.  At this time it is the only Hooters facility offering overnight accommodations since a Hooters Inn motel located along Interstate 4 in Lakeland, Florida was demolished in 2007. 

As part of their 25th anniversary, ''HOOTERS Magazine'' released their top HOOTERS girls of all time. Among those best 25 known were Lynne Austin, the late Kelly Jo Dowd (mother of golfer Dakoda Dowd), Bonnie-Jill Laflin, Leeann Tweeden, and Holly Madison.<ref>"The Tope HOOTERS Girls of all time".

==Hooters Girls==

thumb|right|A Hooters Girl at their Singapore restaurant.A '''Hooters Girl''' is a waitress employed by the Hooters restaurant chain. They are instantly recognizable by their uniform of a white tank top with the Hooters owl logo and the location name on the front paired with the famously short orange runner's shorts. Originally, the shirts were white cotton, pulled tight and knotted in the back to emphasize the breasts. For years, this knot tying was a Hooters ritual before opening. Later, Hooters changed to a tight white spandex shirt that eliminated the knot-tying. Waitresses also have a choice of shirts that are more suitable for cold weather. The company also began using other colors and designs for their tops such as a camouflage theme on Monday ("Military Mondays"), black on Friday ("Formal Fridays"), and the football uniforms of a local NFL team during the NFL season, yet this varies from state to state. The two uniforms handed out at employment date is a black uniform and the white, the black being worn usually all day Sunday and Monday night for football and Tuesday/Thursday for basketball. The remainder of the Hooters Girls' uniform consists of the restaurants panty hose, white "scrunch" socks, and clean white shoes. Men who work at Hooters wear Hooters hats, shirts with long pants, Bermuda shorts, or attire more suitable for cooking.

==Employee handbook requirements==
thumb|The inside of a Hooters Restaurant in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee.]]
The Smoking Gun website obtained a copy of the Hooters Employee Handbook<ref></ref> which notes that:
:''Customers can go to many places for wings and beer, but it is our Hooters Girls who make our concept unique. Hooters offers its customers the look of the "All American Cheerleader, Surfer, Girl Next Door."''
Female employees are required to sign that they "acknowledge and affirm" the following:
# My job duties require I wear the designated Hooters Girl uniform.
# My job duties require that I interact with and entertain the customers.
# The Hooters concept is based on female sex appeal and the work environment is one in which joking and sexual innuendo based on female sex appeal is commonplace.
# I do not find my job duties, uniform requirements, or work environment to be offensive, intimidating, hostile, or unwelcome.

==Public perception==
===Controversy===

The chain is controversial on two counts:

The uniform is considered by some to be an objectification of women. The general environment of the restaurant is seen by many  people as sexist and demeaning to women. The chain is also frequently criticized by those who object to the restaurant's theme, in one case causing a Hooters in Vienna, West Virginia to close.

The restaurant hires only women as servers, and refers to them as "Hooters Girls". Several discrimination lawsuits brought against the chain by men wishing to be employed as servers have been settled out of court or dropped by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), some after an advertising campaign featuring St. Petersburg, Florida Hooters' kitchen manager Vince Gigliotti dressed in a Hooters Girl uniform. Men do find employment at Hooters as cooks, dishwashers, and managers where most wear Bermuda shorts, Hawaiian shirts, and similar garb.

The company's website acknowledges that "many consider 'Hooters' a slang term for a portion of the female anatomy," but it adds, "Hooters Girls have the same right to use their natural female sex appeal to earn a living as do supermodels Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell."

The chain has changed its focus in the past decades. When Hooters began, it was thought of as mainly men, but now it is a "neighborhood, family-friendly restaurant". Now offering kids menus, family sections (nonsmoking), kids eat free Wednesdays, and children's birthdays are very regular. Hooters Girls are now trying to erase the stereotype of ''putting women down'' and demeaning to women.

===Public relations===
Hooters has an extensive public relations campaign and has actively supported charities through its '''Hooters Community Endowment Fund''', also known as '''HOO.C.E.F.''', a pun on Habitat for Humanity, Make-A-Wish Foundation, Special Olympics, and Muscular Dystrophy Association.<ref></ref> In addition, after the death of Kelly Jo Dowd, a former Hooters Girl on the cover of the Hooters calendar in 1995, and later a restaurant general manager, Hooters began a campaign against breast cancer, with awareness of the issue being spread through the Kelly Jo Dowd Fund.  Local restaurants will often select their own local charities.

Hooters also launched what it calls "Operation Let Freedom Wing," which involves sending its celebrities, such as Hooters Calendar Girl, UC3 and singer Angela Lanza, to visit U.S. troops overseas, including to Afghanistan.
