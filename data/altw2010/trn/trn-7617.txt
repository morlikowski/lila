'''Tomáš Rosický''' ( (Tom-aash Ro-sits-ski); born Czech international football player, who currently plays his club football for the English Arsenal. 
He is the brother of Jiří Rosický.

==Club career==

An attacking midfielder nicknamed 'the Little Mozart', Rosický is known for his phenomenal skill and his ability to orchestrate the midfield with good passing and the composure to keep the ball in the final third.

===Borussia Dortmund===
He cost Borussia Dortmund £18 million, a Bundesliga record when he arrived from Sparta Prague in 2001. Rosický's reputation grew during his time at Dortmund, and during the latter stages of his spell at the club, Dortmund were in substantial financial trouble and could not hold onto him despite recognising his influence on the team. Press reports linked him with big money transfers to Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal. Rosický expressed a desire for Dortmund to allow him to leave at the end of the 2005–06 season, and the arrival of South African Steven Pienaar was made in preparation for Rosický's departure.

===Arsenal===
====2006–07 season====

On transfer fee was undisclosed but was rumoured to be in the region of £6.8 million due to a get-out clause in his contract at Borussia Dortmund.<ref>[http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?&article=389261 Czech midfielder Tomáš Rosický signs for Arsenal], Arsenal.com, Frenchman Robert Pirès.

On Champions League third round 2006–07 season, only hitting the net three times in the Premiership all season.

Rosický is preferred as a left-winger at Arsenal, as some of his play resembles his predecessor of his position, Robert Pires.While still at an early stage in his career, Tomáš has gained the nickname(s) of "The Little Mozart" and "The Mozart of Football" for his ability to orchestrate play on the pitch.

====2007–08 season====

Rosický again started the 2007–08 season deployed as a left midfielder. On Sevilla game, Rosicky made his comeback against Bolton Wanderers in a Premier League match. He combined well with Wigan Athletic after being put clean through by Middlesbrough in which Arsenal lost 2–1 and was on the scoresheet again against Everton with a low drive from the edge of the box in a 4–1 victory. He again scored in the away match against Fulham from six yards out after being set up by Eduardo. The match ended in a 3–0 victory for Arsenal.

Arsenal fans last saw the Czech midfielder when he left the pitch after nine minutes of the FA Cup tie with Newcastle at Emirates Stadium on January 26. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger later described the 27-year-old's injury as "not a serious one but a strange one". However, it sidelined him for the remainder of the season and kept him out of the summer tournament, EURO 2008.

==International career==

Rosický made his international debut in 2000 aged 19, against the Republic of Ireland. He played for his country at Euro 2000 and Euro 2004 and helped the side qualify for the 2006 World Cup in Norway, to ensure qualification for the finals.

In the 2006 World Cup finals, Rosický scored two goals in the Czech Republic's 3–0 victory over the United States in their opening match, on June 12, 2006. The Czech Republic went out at the World Cup in the group stages, with Rosický forced to move into the attack after injuries to both of the country's star strikers,  Jan Koller and Milan Baroš.

At the beginning of the 2006–07 season Rosický was made captain of the Czech Republic national side, replacing the retiring Pavel Nedvěd which he has taken up very well, greatly helping the Czech Republic qualify for Euro 2008.

Rosický missed Euro 2008 due to injury.
