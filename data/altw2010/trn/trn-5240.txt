'''Robert Badinter''' (born French criminal Socialist Party (PS), he served as Minister of Justice and then President of Constitutional Council under François Mitterrand.

He is currently a Senator for the département''.

==Political career==
===Death penalty===

In 1965, along with Jean-Denis Bredin, Badinter founded the law firm Bredin Prat, where he practiced until 1981. Badinter's struggle against the death penalty began after Roger Bontems's execution, on 1971 revolt in Clairvaux Prison. During the police storm, Buffet sliced the throat of the hostages. Badinter was the attorney for Bontems, and although it was established during the trial that Buffet alone was the murderer, the jury still decided to sentence both men to death. Applying the death penalty to a person who had not killed outraged Badinter to the point that he dedicated himself to the abolition of the death penalty.

In this context, and as a lawyer, he accepted to defend Patrick Henry. In January 1976, 8-year old Philipe Bertrand was kidnapped. Patrick Henry was suspected very soon, but released because of a lack of proof. He gave interviews on  television, saying that those who kidnapped and killed children deserved death. A few days later, he was again arrested, and shown young Philippe's corpse hidden in a blanket under his bed. Badinter and Robert Bocquillon defended Henry, making a case not in favour of Henry, but against the death penalty. The defence won, and Henry was sentenced to life imprisonment.

The death penalty was again applied in France later on, but it became a public matter. Between 1976 and 1981, three people were executed.

===Ministerial mandate (1981-1986)===

In 1981, Minister of Justice. Among his first actions was a bill to the French Parliament that abolished the death penalty for all crimes, which the Parliament voted after heated debate on September 30, 1981.

During his mandate, he also passed several laws, such as:

* Abolition of the "''juridictions d'exception''" ("exceptional trials"), like the Cour de Sûreté de l'État ("Security Court of the State") and the military tribunals in time of peace.
* Consolidation of private liberties (such as the lowering of the age of consent for homosexual sex to that for heterosexual sex)
* Improval of the Rights of Victims (any convicted person can make an appeal before the European Commission for Human Rights and the European Court for Human Rights)
* Development of sentences without a loss of liberty (like general interest work for minor petty crimes)

He remained a minister until February 18, 1986.
