==About the Municipality==
===The name ''Hornindal''===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the farm Horne (Old Norse ''Hornvin''), since the first church was built there. The first element is ''horn'' which means "horn" (here referring to a pointed mountain behind the farm), the last element is ''vin'' which means "meadow" or "pasture".  So the meaning of the compounded name ''Hornindal'' is "the valley/dale of Horne".

===Coat-of-Arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times (1987) and was designed by Petter Eide. It shows three silver blades of scythes on a blue background.  Historically, farming and blacksmithing were vital industries in Hornindal.  At one point, there were as many as 200 blacksmiths in the area.  There was also a rich tradition of making handmade scythes and this was very symbolized by putting scythes on the coat-of-arms.<ref> </ref>

===Background===
Since ancient times, Hornindal was a sub-parish ''(sokn)'' of the Eid parish ''(prestegjeld)''. In 1865, Hornindal became a parish of its own and then two years later, on 1 January 1867, Hornindal was established as a separate municipality (see formannskapsdistrikt). At this time, Hornindal had a population of 1,612.<ref name=Dag> </ref>

In 1964, the municipality was dissolved and it was divided between the neighboring municipalities of Eid and Stryn. The 310 residents living in Navelsaker and Holmøyvik and all of Hornindal west of there went to Eid, and the 1,184 residents to the east of those areas went to Stryn.<ref name=Dag />

On 1 January 1977, the municipality of Hornindal was separated from Stryn.  The portions of Hornindal that were moved to Eid in 1964 remained there.  The new municipality had a population of 1,202.<ref name=Dag /> 

===Local Churches===

*''Hornindal kyrkje'' (built in 1856) is located in the village of Grodås
