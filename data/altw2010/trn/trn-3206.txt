'''''The King of Fighters '96''''' is the third game in ''The King of Fighters'' series by SNK. It continues the three-part storyline arc known as the "Orochi Saga," which began in The King of Fighters '95. The King of Fighters '96 was ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in Japan. The Saturn port requires a memory expansion cartridge to run. This game was also released on the Nintendo Game Boy in Japan only.

This is the first game to achieve KOF's distinct look; its graphics and sound more closely resemble the newer King of Fighters games than they do those of KOF '95.

==Storyline==

The King of Fighters is an annual tournament uniting fighters from across the world, starting in 1994. Those deemed worthy of entry into the King of Fighters receive a letter of invitation from an anonymous sponsor of the tournament. Fighters are divided into teams of three and battle other teams in order to advance to the finals.

In The King of Fighters '94 and The King of Fighters '95, the sponsor of the King of Fighters tournament turned out to be Rugal Bernstein, a notorious criminal and fighter who held the tournament in order to satisfy his thirst for competition. He was consequently defeated at the end of the first two tournaments by the team from Japan, consisting of the story's main protagonists, Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido, and Goro Daimon.

In 1996, the King of Fighters tournament was announced again, though the letters of invitation sent out to fighters were no longer sent by Rugal. The letters also announced many changes, the first of which being a massive overhaul of the tournament's approach. During the time that had passed between the tournaments in 1995 and 1996, and the King of Fighters tournament's fame had grown immensely, to the point that it turned into a major international event, which had not happened before. Huge corporations transformed the King of Fighters tournament into something widely televised, commercialized, and celebrated, drawing in many crowds.

The Japan Team reached the finals of the tournament again, where the sponsor turned out to be a woman named Orochi, and that he would soon have to battle against it.

However, Kyo's battle against Orochi would get an unexpected head-start when a mysterious man named Goenitz appeared from out of nowhere and confronted both Kyo and Chizuru, telling them that the revival of Orochi would soon come to pass and that no one would be able to stop him from within his appearance. To the surprise of both Benimaru and Daimon, Kyo reveals to them that Goenitz had defeated him a few weeks before the start of the tournament and that it caused Kyo to re-evaluate his own moves before the competition (This explains the fact of why Kyo's ground fire spark was replaced by his new flame fist combo attack)

To ensure that his friends will be safe, Kyo tells them to hit the sidelines so that he can battle against Goenitz without holding anything back. During the fight, Kyo gets some unexpected help from Iori, who feels drawn to the battle for some unknown reason. Through this unlikely team-up, both Kyo and Iori succeed in defeating Goenitz and ensuring the safety of the fighters and the fans, but their victory however is short-lived when a dying Goenitz tells them that in one year, Orochi will return to the Earth and that he'll wipe out the entire human race in an instant. Upon saying this statement, Goenitz transforms himself into a gale tornado and disappears upon everyone's own sight, confirming the fact that he had indeed died. At the same time, a strange power overtakes Iori's senses and causes him to go into a short but deadly rampage, resulting in the deaths of his teammates Vice and Mature. With the revelation of Orochi's destined arrival in his mind, Kyo now wonders on what will happen to him when he confronts the mysterious Orochi from within the destined battle.
