'''Operaatio Bagration''' oli puna-armeijan kesällä 1944 toteuttama massiivinen hyökkäys Wehrmachtin Keskustan armeijaryhmää vastaan. Operaatio Bagrationin aikana akselivallat kärsivät 300-400&nbsp;000  sotilaan tappiot.<ref> }}</ref> Operaatio sai nimensä venäläisestä Napoleonin sotien jalkaväenkenraalista Pjotr Bagrationista.

Saksan päämaja oli vakuuttunut, että neuvostoliittolaiset jatkaisivat hyökkäystä rintaman eteläosassa, jossa puna-armeija oli jo 75 km:n päässä Teheranin konferenssissa marraskuussa 1943.  Noin 2,3 miljoonaa puna-armeijan sotilasta hyökkäsi 800&nbsp;000 saksalaista vastaan murskaten saksalaisten puolustuksen. Minsk vallattiin 3. heinäkuuta ja samalla yli 50&nbsp;000 saksalaista jäi sotavangeiksi ja jo kymmenen päivää myöhemmin neuvostojoukot olivat saavuttaneet Puolan rajan ja nopea offensiivi motitti Kuurinmaalla taistelleen Pohjoisen armeijaryhmän joukot. 
Neuvostoarmeija joutui nopean etenemisensä seurauksena huoltovaikeuksiin ja hyökkäys oli pakko pysäyttää.

'''Operation ''Bagration''''' (, Operatsiya ''Bagration'') was the Soviet 1944 '''Belorussian Strategic Offensive Operation'''<ref>Alternative spellings for ''Belorussian Offensive'' are ''Byelorussian Offensive'' and ''German forces from the Belorussian Strategic Offensive Operation (3 October 1943 - 31 December 1943)</ref>

The operation was named after 18th–19th century Georgian Prince Pyotr Bagration, general of the Russian army who received a mortal wound at the Battle of Borodino.

The Soviet armies directly involved in Operation ''Bagration'' were the 1st Baltic Front under Hovhannes Bagramyan, the 1st Belorussian Front commanded by Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky, the 2nd Belorussian Front commanded by Colonel-General G.F. Zakharov, and the 3rd Belorussian Front commanded by Colonel-General Ivan Chernyakhovsky.  

This action resulted in the almost complete destruction of the German Fourth Army, Ninth Army.  The operation "was the most calamitous defeat of all the German armed forces in World War II".<ref>Zaloga, ''Bagration 1944: The destruction of Army Group Centre'', 7.</ref>

==Background==
Operation ''Mars'' had shown. But by June 1944, despite shortening its front line, it had been exposed following the crushing of Liberation of Kiev and the Liberation of the Crimea in the late summer, autumn and winter of 1943–44 — the so-called third period of the Great Patriotic War. Operation ''Suvorov'' had seen Army Group Centre itself forced to retreat westwards from Smolensk during the autumn of 1943.

By the middle of June 1944 the distance that the Western Allies from the Cotentin Peninsula and the Soviets from the Vitebsk Gate to Berlin was just over 650 miles for the former and just under 750 for the latter, so for the Third Reich the strategic threats were about the same.<ref name=Ziemke_p11>Ziemke, p.11</ref> Hitler underestimated the threat posed by Soviet troops facing Army Group Centre and had redeployed one third of Army Group Centre's artillery, half their tank destroyers and 88% of their tanks to the Southern front where the German high command expected the next major Soviet offensive.<ref name=Ziemke_p11/>

''Bagration'', in combination with the neighbouring ''Lvov-Sandomierz'' Operation launched a few weeks later in Ukraine, allowed the Soviet Union to recapture practically all the territories within its 1941 borders, advance into German East Prussia, and reach the outskirts of Warsaw after gaining control of Poland east of the Vistula river.

The battle has been described as the triumph of the Soviet theory of "the front commanders left their opposite numbers completely confused about the main axis of attack until too late.

==Prelude to the battle==
===The ''Maskirovka'' campaign===

The Russian word ''maskirovka'' literally means 'camouflaging' in English, but has broader application in military use, and during WWII was used by the Soviet commanders to describe a broad range of measures to create deception with the goal of inflicting surprise on the Wehrmacht forces.<ref>Glantz, Soviet Military Deception, xxxvii-xxxviii</ref>

The ''Eastern Front offensive in the summer of Baltic against Carpathians. It was decided that the first two possibilities were unlikely, since there was easily defensible terrain in these sectors. 

''Operation ''Barbarossa'', three years earlier. In order to maximise the chances of success, a major campaign of deception — ''maskirovka'' — was undertaken to convince the German High Command that the summer offensive would, in fact, be in the south against Fremde Heere Ost''.<ref>Glantz, Soviet Military Deception, pp.360-379</ref>

Though at corps level, several German commanders noted concerns about increased Soviet activity opposite Army Group Centre, German forces were transferred southwards to Army Group North Ukraine throughout the summer, in order to meet an attack there. This left Army Group Centre dangerously weakened, as ''Stavka'' had intended.

===Operations ''Rail War'' and ''Concert''===

The first phase of Operation ''Bagration'' involved the many partisan formations in the Belorussian SSR, which were instructed to restart their campaigns of targeting railways and communications behind German lines. From 19 June, large numbers of explosive charges were placed on rail tracks, and though many were cleared, they had a significant disruptive effect. The partisans would also be used to mop up encircled German forces once the breakthrough and exploitation phases of the operation were completed.

At the commencement of the offensive, the Soviets had committed approximately 1,700,000 combat and support troops, approximately 24,000 artillery pieces and mortars, 4,080 tanks and assault guns and 6,334 aircraft. German strength at the outset was approximately 800,000 combat and support troops, 9,500 artillery pieces, but only 553 tanks and assault guns and 839 aircraft. In particular, Army Group Centre was seriously short of mobile reserves: the demotorized 14th Infantry Division was the only substantial reserve formation available, though the Panzergrenadier-Division Feldherrnhalle'' was also held in reserve. The relatively static lines in Belorussia had, however, enabled the Germans to construct extensive field fortifications, with multiple trench lines to a depth of several kilometres and heavily mined defensive belts.

The 1st Belorussian Front was particularly large, and included further units which were only committed during the following Lublin-Brest Offensive.

==The battle - first phase: the breakthrough operations==

Operation ''Bagration'' began on 22 June 1944,  the same calendar day on which the Germans had previously invaded Russia in 1941, with probing attacks throughout the German lines. The main offensive began in the early morning of 23 June, with an artillery bombardment of unprecedented scale against the defensive works. Within hours, some sectors of the German defences were in danger of being breached.

===Vitebsk-Orsha Offensive Operation===

The operation was conducted by the Fourth Army.

In the north, the 1st Baltic Front pushed the IX corps over the Dvina, while encircling the LIII Corps in the city of VI Corps, shattering it. Vitebsk was taken by 27 June, the entire LIII Corps of 30,000 men being destroyed.

The 3rd Belorussian Front simultaneously opened operations against Fourth Army's XXVII Corps holding Orsha and the main Moscow - Minsk road. Despite a tenacious German defence, Orsha was liberated by 26 June, and the 3rd Belorussian Front's mechanised forces were able to penetrate far into the German rear, reaching the Berezina River by 28 June.

===Mogilev Offensive Operation===

The primary aim of the Mogilev Offensive, and of the Fourth Army while the developing Vitebsk-Orsha and Bobruysk Offensives encircled it. The 2nd Belorussian Front's units attacked on XXXIX Panzer Corps and XII Corps.

The Dnepr was crossed by the 49th Army by 27 June, and by 28 June it had encircled and taken the town of Mogilev. The XXXIX Panzer Corps and XII Corps began to fall back towards the Berezina River under heavy air attack, but were retreating into a trap.

===Bobruysk Offensive Operation===

The Bobruysk Offensive, against Ninth Army on the southern flank of Army Group Centre, was opened by 1st Belorussian Front on 23 June, but it suffered heavy losses attempting to penetrate the German defences. Rokossovsky ordered additional bombing and artillery preparation, and launched further attacks the next day.

The 3rd Army broke through in the north of the sector, trapping the German XXXV Corps against the 65th Army then broke through the XXXXI Panzer Corps to the south; by 27 June the two German corps were encircled in a pocket east of Bobruysk under constant aerial bombardment. 

Some elements of Ninth Army managed to break out of Bobruysk on 28 June, but up to 70,000 troops were killed or taken prisoner. The 1st Belorussian Front's forces liberated Bobruysk on 29 June after intense street fighting.

==Second phase: the destruction of Army Group Centre==

The second phase of Operation Bagration involved the entire operation's most significant single objective: the retaking of Minsk, capital of the Belorussian SSR. It would also complete the large-scale encirclement and destruction, set up by the first phase, of much of Army Group Centre.

===Minsk Offensive Operation===

From 5th Guards Tank Army and an attached cavalry-mechanised group) began to push on to secure crossings of the 11th Guards Army. In the south, exploitation forces of the 1st Belorussian Front began to close the lower pincer of the trap developing around the German Fourth Army. 

The Germans rushed the 5th Panzer Division into Belorussia to cover the approaches to Minsk, while the units of Fourth Army began to withdraw over the Berezina crossings, where they were pounded by heavy air bombardment.
