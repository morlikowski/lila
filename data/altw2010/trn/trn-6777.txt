== Handlingen ==

Det romerske imperiet har hatt herredømmet over Britannia i 500 år. Men når imperiet faller, trekker romerne seg ut av Britannia, og overlater landet og dets befolkning til de blodtørstige sakserne som invaderer nordfra. Arthur (Clive Owen), sønn av en romersk far og en britisk mor, leder en avdeling riddere på vegne av Romerriket. Slitt mellom personlige ambisjoner og pliktfølelse ser Arthur frem til å forlate Britainnia, og vende tilbake til stillheten og stabiliteten i Roma. Men før Arthur og hans riddere av det runde bord - Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone), Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), Dagonet (Ray Stevenson) og Gawain (Joel Edgerton) - blir løst fra tjenesten får de ett siste oppdrag - å bringe en høytstående romersk familie i sikkerhet bak Hadrians mur, før sakserne med den grusomme Cerdic (Stellan Skarsgård) i spissen får klørne i dem. På sin vei støter de på en ung kvinne som blir torturert for religiøst kjetteri - en tapper og vakker kvinne ved navn Guinevere (Keira Knightley), som forsøker å få Arthur og hans ridderne til å forstå at de er alt som står mellom de innfødte og sakserne som vil slakte dem ned. Mens ridderne eskorterer de adelige og et følge av uskyldige sivile i sikkerhet, må Arthur avgjøre sin egen skjebne - flukt og frihet eller den visse død i kampen mot hæren som stormer mot dem. Og nå når Romerriket er borte trenger Britainnia en leder til å fylle tomrommet - en som ikke bare kan møte den nåværende trusselen, men siden lede øyriket inn i en ny alder. Sammen med sin tidligere fiende Merlin (Stephan Dillane), og med Guinevere ved sin side, må Arthur finne styrken i seg selv for å forandre historiens gang.

'''''King Arthur''''' is a 2004 film directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by David Franzoni. It stars Clive Owen as the title character.

The makers of the film claim to present a historically accurate version<ref>
A historical approach to the Arthurian legends had already been showcased in film once - in ''Arthur as a Roman soldier rather than a medieval knight.

==Plot==
Arthur, also known as ''Sarmatian Britain at the close of the Roman occupation in 467 A.D. He and his men guard Matthews, John. [http://www.indielondon.co.uk/film/king_arthur_historical_facts.html King Arthur - Key historical facts.] Retrieved September 9, 2007</ref> led by their mysterious leader Merlin. He is not the first Arthur - over the years, many of his ancestors have manned the Wall, leading Sarmatian auxiliaries.  

As the film starts, Arthur and his remaining men Bishop Germanius of Auxerre in the freezing winter to rescue an important Roman family, which includes the Saxons, who are led by their chief Cerdic and his son Cynric. The knights are charged with this rescue because Rome is retiring from Britain, now considered an indefensible outpost.

In the course of this mission, Arthur encounters and rescues a Woad princess, his mother's side). His famous sword, father's, which he drew from the tombstone on Pendragon's burial mound as a boy (inspiring the legend of the Sword in the Stone) in an effort to rescue his mother who died during a Woad attack.   

The Roman family is rescued, but the party soon encounter the Saxons at an ice-covered lake. Though greatly outnumbered, Arthur, Guinevere and the knights manage to repel them when Dagonet runs to the middle of the ice and begins to break it, at the cost of his life.

Struck by Rome leaving its subjects to the mercy of the Saxons, Arthur is further disillusioned when he learns that Bishop Pelagius, whose teachings about the equality of all men inspired the brotherhood of his Round Table — has been executed as a heretic by order of Bishop Germanius himself.

In due course, Arthur and his remaining men forsake Roman citizenship and form an alliance with the Woads to fight the Saxons. In the climatic battle, the Battle of Badon Hill, the Woads catapult balls of fire at the Saxon army, and when they enter battle, Guinevere engages in combat with Cynric. Cedric believes Tristan to be Arthur, and duels him, eventually winning. As Tristan lies on the ground dying, Cedric looks up to see that Arthur is still alive. Meanwhile, Guinevere beats Cynric but is knocked to the ground and Lancelot rushes in to save her. As they fight, Cynric picks up a crossbow when Lancelot's back is turned and shoots him. Lancelot throws his sword at Cynric, and though mortally wounded, he moves towards Lancelot and dies as Lancelot plunges a sword through his neck. Lancelot falls back and Guinevere watches as he dies. Arthur kills Cedric, then keeps his promise by burning the bodies of his dead men, Lancelot and Tristan.

The film ends with Arthur and Guinevere's marriage. Merlin then proclaims him to be their king. King Arthur and his remaining knights promise to lead the Britons, united with the defeat of the Saxons and retreat of the Romans, against future invaders. The last scene shows the horses of Lancelot, Dagonet and Tristan roaming the lands freely, while Lancelot speaks of their home in the great legend.

==Production==

The movie was produced by Gladiator'', wrote the screenplay. The historical consultant for the film was John Matthews, an author known for his books on esoteric Celtic spirituality, some of which he co-wrote with his wife Caitlin Matthews. The research consultant was Linda A. Malcor, co-author of ''From Scythia to Camelot: A Radical Reinterpretation of the Legends of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, and the Holy Grail'' where possible non-Celtic sources for the Arthurian legends are explored.

The film's main set, a replica of a section of Hadrian's Wall, was the largest film set ever built in Ireland, and was located in a field in [http://www.kildare.ie/BallymoreEustace Ballymore-Eustace Co.Kildare.]  The replica was one kilometre long, which took a crew of 300 construction workers four and a half months to build.  The fort in the film was based on the Roman fort named Vindolanda, which was built around 80 AD just south of Hadrian's Wall in what is now called Chesterholm, in Northern England.

==Connections to Arthurian legend==
The film's storyline is mostly original, save for the elements of Saxons as Arthur's adversaries and the Battle of Badon Hill. 

Many of the traditional elements of the legends are dropped, like the Holy Grail and Tristan's lover Iseult. The film omits the love triangle between Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere except for mutual attraction between the latter two.

The knights' characterizations in the legends are also dropped. The boorish and lusty Bors, father of many children, is very different from his namesake whose purity and celibacy allowed him to witness the Holy Grail. 
 
The film does not feature Kay and Bedivere. Along with Gawain, they already appear as Arthur's companions in very early sources, like ''Culhwch and Olwen'' in the ''Mabinogion''. The portrayal of Bors, however, is much closer to the traditional depiction of Kay than his legendary namesake. 

Lancelot and Galahad are portrayed as having similar ages while according to traditional versions they are father and son respectively (this approach is also found in modern Arthurian fiction - such as Bernard Cornwell's ''The Warlord Chronicles'', in which they are brothers).

In the film, Lancelot fights using two swords. In Arthurian legend the "Knight with Two Swords" is the ill-fated Sir Balin, but this refers to a cursed sword he keeps, not his fighting style.

Guinevere is drastically altered from Arthurian legend - she is portrayed as a barbarian warrior who joins Arthur and the knights in battle. While there was historical precedent for this portrayal (for example, the warrior queen CBC News</ref>
), no source, early or late, describes Guinevere in this way; also, Boudica and her ilk lived centuries before the film is set, making the film's portrayal anachronistic. Nor is there any evidence for her depiction as a rustic Celt; in fact, in Geoffrey of Monmouth's ''Historia Regum Britanniae'', which contains one of the oldest accounts of the character, Guinevere has Roman blood while Arthur is an indigenous Celt.

Dagonet, a self-sacrificing warrior in the film, has Arthur's court jester as his namesake. The character appears in ''Le Morte D'Arthur'' and ''Idylls of the King''.

Tristan has a pet hawk. In Welsh legends, a figure named ''Gwalchmai'' is commonly considered identical with Gawain (both are nephews of Arthur); a popular though unlikely proposed meaning of his name is "hawk of May".<ref name="Bromwich">Bromwich, Rachel. ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', pp. 367–371.</ref> 

The role of traitor, typically ascribed to Mordred, is given a smaller part in the form of a young British scout, played by Alan Devine, who betrays his people to the Saxons. The character is unnamed, but called "British Scout" in the credits. Tristan kills the traitor with an arrow from the other side of Hadrian's Wall during the climactic battle.

Despite the film's historical angle, Merlin was not originally part of the legends. It is generally agreed that he is based on two figures - ''Myrddin Wyllt'' (Myrddin the Wild), and Aurelius Ambrosius, a highly fictionalized version of the historical war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus. The former had nothing to do with Arthur and flourished after the Arthurian period. This composite Merlin was created by Geoffrey of Monmouth.

==Historical notes==

It would appear that the Arthur depicted in the film is based most closely upon Ambrosius Aurelianus, the Romano-Briton who fought against the Saxons in the 5th century, and was probably the leader of the Romano-British at the Battle of Mons Badonicus (Mount Badon). However, Arthur's full name in the film is ''Artorius Castus'', referring to Lucius Artorius Castus, a historical Roman active in Britain in the 2nd century.<ref name = "indielondon" /> It is specified Arthur was given the ancestral name of a legendary leader.
