==Histoire==
Le peuplement de Coalville par des mormons est le fait du hasard. En 1858, William Henderson Smith, voyageant entre Salt Lake City et Fort Bridger, remarque que le blé tombé des caravanes avait germé. Il ramène ce blé à Salt Lake City et l’année suivante, il revient dans la région avec deux hommes. La localité s’est d’abord appelée Chalk Creek, en raison des mines de charbon dans les alentours. Brigham Young a envoyé des hommes exploiter une mine.

'''Coalville''' is a city in Summit County, Salt Lake City, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,382 at the 2000 census. It is the Summit County.  Interstate 80 runs through the town, as well as the Weber River which runs into the Echo Reservoir just north of Coalville.

== History ==
Coalville was founded in 1859 by William Henderson Smith, an early Mormon freighter.  He noticed that wheat spilled by other wagons moving through the area would grow to maturity.  He subsequently convinced four families to settle in the area with him.<ref>Utah Guide to the State - American Guide Series, Hastings House Publishers 1941, pg 367 - as quoted at http://www.co.summit.ut.us/history/coalville/coalville.html</ref>  The settlement was originally called '''Chalk Creek'''.

Early life in Chalk Creek was difficult, and during winters the settlers dealt with a constant scarcity of food.  When food ran out, they would travel to Salt Lake City for supplies.  The local Indians were also hostile for a time, and the settlers built a fort on advice of Brigham Young.<ref>Thompson, Norma Eileen Pyper, A Community Study of Coalville, Utah 1859-1914, pg 18 - as quoted at http://www.co.summit.ut.us/history/coalville/coalville.html</ref>

In 1854 the territorial government in Utah offered a $1000 reward to anyone who could find coal within 40 miles of Salt Lake City.  Four years later, Thomas Rhodes found a coal vein in the Chalk Creek area, and coal mining began in earnest.<ref>Thompson, Norma Eileen Pyper, A Community Study of Coalville, Utah 1859-1914, pg 42 and 47 - as quoted at http://www.co.summit.ut.us/history/coalville/coalville.html</ref>.  Hundreds of tons of coal were shipped to Salt Lake City, and soon a narrow gauge railroad was built.<ref>Peterson, Marie Ross and Pearson, Mary M. , Echoes of Yesterday, Daughters of Utah Pioneers of Summit County 1947, pg 89 - as quoted at http://www.co.summit.ut.us/history/coalville/coalville.html</ref>  The settlement was renamed '''Coalville''' as a result of this early success mining coal.
