The '''Territory of Hawaii''', abbreviated officially as '''T.H.''', was established on U.S. Congress passed the Kingdom of Hawaii and later Republic of Hawaii to the United States. Hawaii's territorial history includes a period from 1941 to 1944 when the islands were placed under martial law. Civilian government was dissolved and a military governor was appointed.

==Provisional Government==
Upon the overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani in 1893, the Committee of Safety led by Provisional Government of Hawaii to govern the islands in transition to expected Victoria Kaiulani, argued that the overthrow of her aunt's government was illegal.

First annexation proceedings began when U.S. President Benjamin Harrison stepped down and Grover Cleveland took office. Cleveland was an anti-imperialist and was strongly against annexation. He withdrew the annexation treaty from consideration, mounted an inquiry and recommended the restoration of Liliuokalani.  Further investigation by Congress led to the Morgan Report, which established that the actions of U.S. troops were completely neutral, and exonerated the U.S. from any accusations of complicity with the overthrow.

The provisional government convened a constitutional convention in Republic of Hawaii. Thurston was urged to become the nation's first president but he was worried his brazen personality would damage the cause of annexation. The more conservative former Supreme Court Justice and friend of Queen Liliuokalani, Sanford B. Dole, was elected the first and only president of the new regime.

==Manifest Destiny==
When Grover Cleveland's presidency ended in March of 1897, former U.S. Civil War soldier William McKinley took office. McKinley believed in increasing American prominence on the international stage.

Under McKinley's policies Americans were sent to fight against Spain in Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico in 1898. Hawaii's strategic location for warfare in the Philippines made it especially important to American interests. 

In April of 1917, Queen Liliuokalani proudly flew the U.S. flag over her residence at Washington Place. She stated it was in honor of the Hawaiians who lost their lives as American soldiers in World War I, and it has been seen as her final acceptance of the overthrow of her monarchy and the annexation of Hawaii to the United States.<ref>[http://starbulletin.com/2001/09/29/news/story6.html Iolani Palace raises U.S.

==Newlands Resolution of 1898==
On Iolani Palace where the Hawaiian flag was lowered and the American flag raised. Dole was appointed Hawaii's first territorial governor.

The Newlands Resolution said, "Whereas, the Government of the Republic of Hawaii having, in due form, signified its consent, in the manner provided by its constitution, to cede absolutely and without reserve to the United States of America, all rights of sovereignty of whatsoever kind in and over the Hawaiian Islands and their dependencies, and also to cede and transfer to the United States, the absolute fee and ownership of all public, Government, or Crown lands, public buildings or edifices, ports, harbors, military equipment, and all other public property of every kind and description belonging to the Government of the Hawaiian Islands, together with every right and appurtenance thereunto appertaining: Therefore, Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That said cession is accepted, ratified, and confirmed, and that the said Hawaiian Islands and their dependencies be, and they are hereby, annexed as a part of the territory of the United States and are subject to the sovereign dominion thereof, and that all and singular the property and rights hereinbefore mentioned are vested in the United States of America."

The Newlands Resolution established a five-member commission to study which laws were needed in Hawaii. The commission included: Territorial Governor Dole (R-HI), U.S. Senators Shelby M. Cullom (R-IL) and John T. Morgan (R-AL), Congressman Robert R. Hitt (R-IL) and former Hawaii Chief Justice and later Territorial Governor Walter F. Frear (R-TH). The commission's final report was submitted to Congress for a debate which lasted over a year. Congress raised objections that establishing an elected territorial government in Hawaii would lead to the admission of state with a non-white majority.

==Organic Act==<!-- This section is linked from Sanford B. Dole -->
Congress finally agreed to grant Hawaii a popularly elected government of its own and McKinley signed a law, An Act to Provide a Government for the Territory of Hawaii, also known as the Hawaiian Organic Act of 1900.

The Organic Act established the Office of the Territorial Governor, an office appointed by the sitting American president and was usually from his own political party. The territorial governor served at the pleasure of the president and could be replaced at any time.

==Tourism begins==
thumb|216px|Matson Navigation Company advertised Hawaii as a tourist destination for the first time late 1890s.

Hawaii's tourism industry began in 1882 when Matson Navigation Company, founded by Captain William Matson, began sailing vessels between San Francisco and Hawaii carrying goods. His transports encouraged him to purchase passenger steamships that would carry tourists hoping to vacation in Hawaii from the mainland United States.

Matson's fleet included the S.S. Wilhelmina, rivaling the best passenger ships serving traditional Atlantic routes. With the boom in interest of Hawaiian vacations by America's wealthiest families in the late 1920s, Matson added the S.S. Mariposa, S.S. Monterey and S.S. Lurline (one of many Lurlines) to the fleet.

Matson Navigation Company opened two resort hotels in Honolulu near royal grounds. The first (and for a time the only) hotel on Waikīkī was the Moana Hotel which opened in 1901. As the first hotel in Waikīkī, the Moana Hotel was nicknamed the "First Lady of Waikīkī."  The hotel gained international attention in 1920 when Edward, Prince of Wales and future King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom, stayed as a guest.

In 1927, the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, informally called the "Pink Palace of the Pacific," opened for business. It was the preferred Hawaii residence of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II.

==Military bases==
With annexation, the United States saw Hawaii as its most strategic military asset. McKinley and his successor U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt expanded the military presence in Hawaii and established several key bases, some still in use today. By 1906, the entire island of Oahu was being fortified at the coastlines with the construction of a "Ring of Steel," a series of gun batteries mounted on steel coastal walls. One of the few surviving batteries completed in 1911, Battery Randolph, is today the site of the Hawaii Army Museum.

List of Territorial Installations:
* Camp McKinley (Est. 1898)
* Fort Kamehameha (Est. 1907)
* Pearl Harbor Naval Station (Est. 1908)
* Fort Shafter (Est. 1907)
* Fort Ruger (Est. 1909)
* Schofield Barracks (Est. 1909)
* Battery Closson (Est. 1911)
* Battery Dudley (Est. 1911)
* Battery Randolph (Est. 1911)
* Fort DeRussy (Est. 1915)
* Wheeler Army Airfield (Est. 1922)

'''Terytorium Hawajów''' - Stanów Zjednoczonych istniejące od 12 sierpnia 1898 do 21 sierpnia 1959.

===Historia===
W styczniu hawajska królowa Lili'uokalani abdykowała pod warunkiem, że władzę w jej kraju przejmie USA a nie rebeliancki rząd pod przywództwem premiera Sanforda Dole. Mimo to rebelianci przejęli władzę i sprawowali ją 3 lata, czyli do czasu interwencji amerykańskiej. 7 lipca 1898 kraj został zajęty zbrojnie przez USA i 12 sierpnia stał się terytorium inkorporowanym. 

21 sierpnia 1959 Stany Zjednoczone oficjalnie przyjęły Hawaje jako pięćdziesiąty stan Unii. Statusu tego nie otrzymała Palmyra, która stała się osobnym terytorium Stanów Zjednoczonych.
