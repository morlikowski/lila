'''סוֹפוֹקְלֵס''' (ביוונית: &Sigma;&omicron;&phi;&omicron;&kappa;&lambda;&eta;&sigmaf;) היה יווני נודע שחי במאה החמישית לפני הספירה בטראגיקונים היווניים הגדולים; הוא היה צעיר מאייסכילוס בכמה עשורים, ומבוגר בכעשור מאוריפידס.  סופוקלס התחרה מול שניהם בתחרויות דראמה רבות.

שנת הולדתו נתונה במחלוקת: יש גורסים שנולד בשנת 495 או 496. על אף שהיה גם כהן ומחזות, וזכה בתחרויות הדראמה בחג דיוניסוס במסגרת הטראגדיות ומחזה סאטירים אחד) בפרס הראשון כעשרים פעמים, יותר מכל מחזאי אחר.  לא ידוע שאי-פעם זכה בפחות מהמקום השני.

מלומדים רבים, ואריסטו ביניהם, החשיבו את סופוקלס לגדול המחזאים של התיאטרון היווני.  ברם, ממאות היצירות שיצר בימי חייו, נשתמרו בשלמותן רק שבע טראגדיות, וכחצי מחזה סאטירים. ישנם שרידים (פראגמנטים) של כשבעים מחזות אחרים שלו. המפורסמות ביותר בין יצירותיו שנשתמרו הן שלוש טראגדיות תבאי, אשר עוסקות בסיפור אדיפוס ובתו אנטיגונה.

==חייו==
סופוקלס נולד כקילומטר וחצי מצפון מערב לאתונה, בדמוס הכפרי קולונוס של ארץ אטיקה.  אם נולד בשנת 495 (ר' לעיל), הרי שנולד חמש שנים לפני קרב מרתון, וחמש-עשרה שנה לפני קרב סאלאמיס.  אביו, סוֹפילוׁס, היה סוחר אמיד; חוקרים שונים סבורים שהיה בעסקי הנגרות, הנפחות, או בניית החרבות, אולם רוב החוקרים גורסים שהיה סוחר או יצרן נשק שהעסיק בעלי מלאכה שונים.

כנער, התחנך סופוקלס באמנויות והתאמן בהיאבקות ופרסים בקרב סאלאמיס בשנת 480 לפני הספירה.

בשנת 468 השתתף סופוקלס לראשונה בתחרויות הדרמטיות בחג דיוניסוס, והציג את המחזה ''טריפטולמוס''. הוא זכה בפרס הראשון, והביס את אייסכילוס הוותיק, יש אומרים בשל תרגיל פוליטי, מאחר וההצבעה הייתה בשנה זו בידי הצבא ולא בידי העם.

בשנת 440 נבחר סופוקלס לסטראטגוס (אחד מעשרה מצביאים שפיקדו על אתונה).

מענין הדבר שמחזהו המפורסם ביותר, ''אדיפוס המלך'', זכה רק במקום השני בשנת הצגתו.

==מחזותיו שנשמרו ותאריך הפקתם==
במחזותיו של סופוקלס מסתובבת העלילה סביב דמותו של הגיבור, אשר שילוב של נסיבות יוצאות דופן, שבחלקן נובעות מאופיו, חורצות את גורלו הטראגי. העלילה סבוכה, ומתאפיינת בהרבה מתח ופעילות. דמות הגיבור המהווה את המוטיב המרכזי במחזה, היא נעלה ובעלת אופי הרואי, אשר היסוד ההרסני הקיים בה מביא לאובדנו. סופוקלס עושה שימוש גם בדמויות משנה רבות. סופוקלס אינו מאמין בגורל (בניגוד למקובל ביוון של ימיו). הוא מאמין בקיומה של בחירה חופשית ונותן להבין כי אלמלא הפגם באופי הגיבור הסיטואציה הטראגית הייתה נמנעת.

'''Sophocles''' or '''Sofokles''' (; ancient Greek tragedians whose work has survived to the present day. His first plays were written later than those of Dionysia. Sophocles competed in around thirty drama competitions; he won perhaps twenty four and never received lower than second place. Aeschylus won fourteen competitions and was defeated by Sophocles at times. Euripides won only four competitions.<ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.</ref>

The most famous of Sophocles's tragedies are those concerning chorus in the presentation of the plot. He also developed his characters to a greater extent than earlier playwrights such as Aeschylus.<ref name="F247">Freeman: 247</ref>

==Life==

Sophocles, the son of Sophillus, was a member of the rural ''deme'' (small community) of Colonus Hippius in Attica, which would later become a setting for his plays, and was probably born there.<ref name="S41">Sommerstein (2002): 41</ref> <ref name=Sfrxi>Sommerstein (2007): xi</ref> His birth took place a few years before the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC: the exact year is unclear, although 497/6 is perhaps most likely.<ref>Lloyd-Jones 1994: 7</ref><ref name=S41/> His artistic career began in earnest in 468 BC when he took first prize in the Dionysia theatre competition over the reigning master of Athenian drama, Aeschylus.<ref name=S41/><ref>Freeman: 246</ref> The production probably included ''Triptolemus''.<ref name=Sfrxi/> Although Plutarch says that '''this''' was Sophocles' first production, it is now thought that this is an embellishment of the truth and his first production was most likely in 470 BC.<ref name=Sfrxi/>

Sophocles became a man of importance in the public halls of Athens as well as in the theatres. Sophocles was chosen to lead the paean, a choral chant to a god, at the age of 16 celebrating the decisive Greek sea victory over the Persians at the Battle of Salamis. This rather insufficient information about Sophocles’ civic life implies he was a well-liked man who participated in activities in society and showed remarkable artistic ability. He was also elected one of ten strategoi, high executive officials that commanded the armed forces, as a junior colleague of Pericles. Sophocles was born highly wealthy (his father was a wealthy armour manufacturer) and was highly educated throughout his entire life.  Early in his career, the politician Cimon might have been one of his patrons, although if he was there was no ill will borne by Pericles, Cimon's rival, when Cimon was ostracized in 461 BC.<ref name=S41/> In 443/2 he served as one of the ''Hellenotamiai'', or treasurers of Athena, helping to manage the finances of the city during the political ascendancy of Pericles.<ref name=S41/> In 420 he welcomed and set up an altar for the icon of Asclepius at his house, when the deity was introduced in Athens.  For this he was given the posthumous epithet ''Dexion'' (receiver) by the Athenians.<ref>Clinton, Kevin "The Epidauria and the Arrival of Asclepius in Athens", in Ancient Greek Cult Practice from the Epigraphical Evidence, edited by R. Hägg, Stockholm, 1994.</ref>  He was also elected, in 413 BC, to be one of the commissioners crafting a response to the catastrophic destruction of the Athenian expeditionary force in Sicily during the Peloponnesian War.<ref>Lloyd-Jones: 12-13</ref> 

Several ancient writers have commented on Sophocles' love of youths. Athenaeus wrote that in addition to seeking and keeping female courtesans, "Sophocles was fond of young lads, as Euripides was fond of women."<ref>Athenaeus: ''The Deipnosophists,'' Book XIII (603)</ref> He quotes from a now-lost book by Ion of Chios regarding an incident of Sophocles flattering a serving boy at a symposium and then using a strategem to kiss and embrace him, as well as another, ascribed to Hieronymus of Rhodes, in which Sophocles is tricked by a hustler.<ref>Athenaeus: ''The Deipnosophists,'' Book XIII (604E)</ref> Plutarch, in his "Life of Pericles", [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives/Pericles] mentions an incident, during a naval expedition, in which Sophocles praised the beauty of a young recruit. Pericles rebuked him by warning that a general must keep not only his hands clean, but also his eyes.<ref>Plutarch, ''The Lives,'' "Life of Pericles" 8.5</ref>''

Sophocles died at the venerable age of ninety in 406 or 405 BC, having seen within his lifetime both the Greek triumph in the Persian Wars and the terrible bloodletting of the Peloponnesian War.<ref name=S41/> He was so respected by the Athenians that two plays performed at the Lenea soon after his death paid homage to him, and his unfinished play ''Oedipus at Colonus'' was completed and performed years later.<ref name=S41/> Both Iophon, one of his sons, and a grandson, also called Sophocles, followed in his footsteps to become playwrights themselves.<ref>Sommerstein (2002): 41-42</ref>

==Works and legacy==

thumb|right|A portrait from a vase of a Greek actor performing in Sophocles' lost play ''Andromeda''.In Sophocles' time, the Greek art of the drama was undergoing rapid and profound change. It had begun with little more than a chorus, but earlier playwrights had added first one and then two actors and thereby shifted the action of the plays away from the chorus.<ref>Freeman: 242-243</ref> Among Sophocles' earliest innovations was the addition of a third actor, further reducing the role of the chorus and creating greater opportunity for character development and conflict between characters.<ref name=F247/> In fact, Aeschylus, who dominated Athenian playwrighting during Sophocles' early career, adopted this third character into his own playwriting towards the end of his life.<ref name=F247/> It was not until after the death of the old master Aeschylus in 456 BCE that Sophocles became the preeminent playwright in Athens.<ref name=S41/> 

Thereafter, Sophocles emerged victorious in dramatic competitions at 18 Dionysia and 6 Lenaia festivals.<ref name=S41/> In addition to innovations in the structure of drama, Sophocles' work is known for deeper development of characters than earlier playwrights, whose characters are more two-dimensional and are therefore harder for an audience to relate to.<ref name=F247/> His reputation was such that foreign rulers invited him to attend their courts, although unlike Aeschylus who died in Sicily, Sophocles never accepted any of these invitations.<ref name=S41/> Aristotle used Sophocles's ''Oedipus the King'' as an example of perfect tragedy, which suggests the high esteem in which his work was held by later Greeks.<ref>Aristotle. ''Ars Poetica''.</ref>

Only two of the seven surviving plays have securely dated first or second performances: ''Philoctetes'' (Ajax'', ''Antigone'' and ''The Trachiniae'' are generally thought to be among his early works, again based on stylistic elements, with ''Oedipus the King'' coming in Sophocles' middle period. Most of Sophocles' plays show an undercurrent of early fatalism and the beginnings of Socratic logic as a mainstay for the long tradition of Greek tragedy.<ref name=LJ1213>Lloyd-Jones 1994: 8-9</ref><ref>Scullion, pp. 85–86, rejects attempts to date ''Antigone'' to shortly before 441/0 based on an anecdote that the play led to Sophocles' election as general. On other grounds, he cautiously suggests ''c.'' 450 BC.</ref>

===The Theban plays (The Oedipus Cycle)===
 
The ''Theban plays'' or ''The Oedipus Cycle'' consists of three plays: ''Antigone'', ''Oedipus the King'' (''Oedipus Tyrannus''), and ''Oedipus at Colonus''. Although they are now sometimes published under a single cover, Sophocles wrote the three plays for separate festivals, possibly over a duration of forty years or more. Thus, they are not a true trilogy (three plays presented as a continuous narrative).

The tale of Oedipus takes up the themes of being trapped by fate and family. Oedipus, in Ancient Greek mythology killed his father and married his mother without knowledge that they were his parents. His family is fated to be doomed for three generations.

In Sophocles’ first drama of the trilogy, ''Oedipus the King'', the main character, Oedipus, becomes the ruler of Thebes after solving the riddle of the sphinx.  However before solving this riddle, Oedipus had met at a crossroads a man accompanied by servants, Oedipus and the man got in an argument and Oedipus killed the man. Oedipus continued on to Thebes to marry the widowed Queen, although unknown to him, his mother.  Oedipus eventually learns that his mother and father gave him up when he was just an infant in fear that he would kill his father and fulfill the Delphic Oracle’s prophecy of him. Upon learning of the complete prophecy, his mother, Jocasta, realizes the incest and commits suicide. However, they had four children before this occurred. 

Sophocles’ drama, ''Antigone,'' focuses on Oedipus’ daughter Antigone. Antigone is faced with the choice of allowing her brother Polyneices’ body to get eaten by savage dogs or bury him and face death. The king of the land, Creon, has forbidden the burial of Polyneices for he was a traitor to the city. Antigone decides to bury his body and face the consequences of her actions. Creon sentences her to death. Eventually, Creon is convinced to free Antigone from her punishment, but his decision comes too late and Antigone commits suicide. Her suicide triggers the suicide of two others close to King Creon, his son, Haemon, who loved Antigone, and his wife who commits suicide after losing her only son. Antigone focuses on the conflicting duties of civic versus spiritual loyalties.

===Other plays===

Some of Sophocles' other surviving works include ''Ajax'', ''Electra'', and ''Philoctetes'', the last of which won first prize.<ref name=F247248>Freeman: 247&ndash;248</ref>

''Ajax'' focuses on the prideful hero of the Trojan War. He is driven to treachery and eventually his own death. Ajax becomes gravely upset when Achilles’ armor is presented to Odysseus instead of himself. However, Odysseus persuades the kings Menelaus and Agamemnon to grant Ajax a proper burial.
