The '''Porsche 928''' is a AG of MY 1978 to MY 1995, during which time it was one of their most expensive offerings.

In 1983 the 928S with 5-speed manual transmission and 4.7L-16v M28/19 engine was the fastest car sold in North America, at 146 mph.  It was the fastest production road-car in the world in 1986, having been recorded at  on the salt flats in Utah using an early 928 S4.  <ref>[http://www.themotorbookstore.com/porsche-928.html Porsche 928 1977-1994 Road & Track Portfolio<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 
==Conception==

By the late 1960s, Porsche had changed significantly as a company, and executives including owner Ferdinand Porsche were playing with the idea of adding a luxury touring car to the line-up. Managing Director 911, was quickly reaching its maximum potential where it could soon no longer be improved upon. Slumping sales of the 911 seemed to confirm that the model was approaching the end of its economic life cycle. Fuhrmann envisioned the new range-topping model as being the best possible combination of a sports coupe and a luxury sedan, something well equipped and comfortable enough to be easily driven over long distances that also had the power, poise and handling prowess necessary to be driven like a sports car. This set it apart from the 911, which was a pure sports car. 

Ordered by Ferry Porsche to come up with a production-feasible concept for his new model, Fuhrmann initiated a design study in 1971, eventually taking from the process the final specs for the 928. Several drivetrain layouts were considered during early development, including rear and mid-engined designs, but most were dismissed because of technical and/or legislative difficulties. Having the engine, U.S. government would ban the sale of rear-engined cars in response to the consumer outrage over the Chevrolet Corvair, started by Ralph Nader via his book "Unsafe at Any Speed".

Porsche engineers wanted a large-displacement motor to power the 928, and prototype units were built with a 5.0 L Bosch's K-Jetronic oil crisis of the 1970s became an issue of contention, smaller engines were considered in the interest of fuel economy. A push began for the development of a 3.3 L  powerplant they had drawn up specs for, but company engineers balked at this suggestion. Both sides finally settled on a 4.5 L, SOHC 16-valve V8 producing  ( in North America), which they considered to have an acceptable compromise of performance and fuel economy.

The finished car debuted at the 1977 Geneva Motor Show before going on sale later that year as a 1978 model. Although it won early acclaim for its comfort and power, sales were slow. Base prices were much higher than that of the previous range-topping model and its larger size; the 928's futuristic styling put off many purists who were more attracted to the more compact 911.

Fuhrman's replacement, Peter Schutz, decided that the models should be sold side by side, feeling that the 911 still had potential in the company's line-up. Legislation against rear-engined vehicles also didn't materialize. Although the 928 developed an avid fan following, it never sold in the numbers that Fuhrmann had originally predicted and was discontinued in 1995.

==Design==

<blockquote>“Who has the right to define a Porsche only as a rear-engine, air-cooled car?  Just because the first two cars were this, can we not grow?  Do we not evolve?”  - Ernst Fuhrmann</blockquote>

The 928 featured a large, front-mounted and water-cooled rear wheels. Originally displacing 4.5 L and featuring a hp (163 kW/222 PS) for the PS (176 kW/237 hp) in other markets. Porsche upgraded the engine from mechanical to electronic flat engines with four or six cylinders. 

Porsche utilized a transaxle in the 928 to help achieve 50/50 front/rear weight distribution, aiding the car's balance. Although it weighed more than the difficult-to-handle 911, its more neutral weight balance and higher power output gave it similar performance on the track. The 928 was regarded as the more relaxing car to drive at the time. It came with either a five-speed dog leg manual transmission, or a Mercedes-Benz-derived automatic transmission, originally with three speeds, with four speed from 1983 in North America and 1984 in other markets. More than half of production had the automatic transmission. Exact percentage of manual gearbox cars for entire production run is not known but its believed to be between 25 and 30%.

The body, styled by Wolfgang Möbius under guidance of Anatole Lapine, was mainly galvanised bumpers were integrated into the nose and tail and covered in body-coloured drag. Porsche opted not to offer a convertible variant but some aftermarket modifiers offer convertible conversions.

The 928 qualified as a 2+2, having two small seats in the rear. Both rear seats could be folded down to enlarge the luggage area, and both the front and rear seats had sun visors for occupants. The 928 was also the first vehicle in which the instrument binnacle moved with the adjustable steering wheel.

The 928 included several other innovations such as the "Weissach Axle", an early all-wheel steering system that provides passive rear-wheel steering in certain off-throttle cornering situations, and an unsleeved, silicon alloy engine block made of aluminium, which reduced weight and provided a highly durable cylinder bore.

Porsche's design and development efforts paid off during the 1978 European Car of the Year competition where the 928 won ahead of the BMW 7-series and the Ford Granada. The 928 is the only sedans/saloons from major European manufacturers. This is regarded as proof of how advanced the 928 was compared to its contemporaries.

Porsche introduced a refreshed 928 S into the European market in 1980, although it was summer of 1982 and MY 1983 before the model reached spoilers and sported wider wheels and tires than the older variant, but the main change for the 928 S was under the hood, where a revised 4.7 L engine was used. European versions debuted with 300 PS (221 kW/297 hp), and were upgraded to 310 PS (228 kW/306 hp) for MY 1984. From 1984 to 1986, the ROW (Rest Of the World) S model was  officially called S2 in UK. North American spec 1983 and 1984 S models used, among other differences, milder camshafts and additional equipment to obey emissions regulations, and were limited to 239 hp (174 kW/242 PS) as a result.

As the faster S model was not available in the USA and Canada during the first three years of its existence, a "Competition Group" option was created to allow North American customers to have an S model lookalike with spoilers, 16" flat disc wheels, sport seats, sport springs and Bilstein shocks. Customers could specify paint and interior colors the same way as on a normal 928. The package was available in MY 1981 and 1982 and was canceled in 1983 when the S model became available for these markets. Many cars have had S features added by subsequent owners, making original "Competition Group" cars difficult to distinguish without checking option codes.

In 1982, two special models were available for different markets. 205 "Weissach Edition" cars were sold in North America. Unusual features were champagne gold metallic paint, matching brushed gold flat disc wheels, two-tone leather interior, a plaque containing the production number on the dash and the extremely collectible three-piece Porsche luggage set. It's believed these cars were not made with S spoilers even though these were available in USA during this time period as part of the "Competition Group" option. The "Weissach Edition" option was also available for the US market 911 in MY 1980 and 924 in MY 1981.

140 special "50th Jubilee" 928 S models were available outside the USA and Canada to celebrate the company's 50 year existence as a car manufacturer. This model is also sometimes referred to as the "Ferry Porsche Edition" because his signature was embroidered into the front seats. It was painted meteor metallic and fitted with flat disc wheels, wine red leather and special striped fabric seat centers. Similar 911 and 924 specials were also made for ROW markets.

Porsche updated the North American 928 S for 1985, replacing the 4.7 L, SOHC engine with a new 5.0 L, DOHC unit sporting four valves per cylinder and producing 288 hp (215 kW/292 PS). Seats were also updated to a new style. These cars are sometimes unofficially called S3 to distinguish them from 16-valve S models. European models kept a 4.7 L engine, which was slightly more powerful, as standard; a little detuned 32-valve engine together with catalytic converters became an option in some European countries and Australia for 1986. That same year, revised suspension settings, larger brakes with 4-piston calipers and modified exhaust was installed on the 928 S, marking the final changes to old body style cars. ROW models received these changes at the beginning of the model year while North American cars got them only after close to 900 cars were made, starting from VIN 1001. North American version of this late 1986 model is sometimes referred as S3.5 or S3½ because of these changes. Name is little misleading as more than 2/3 of 1986 North American model production had these updates.

The 928 S4 variant debuted in the second half of 1986 as a 1987 model, an updated version of the 5.0 L V8 for all markets producing 320 PS (235 kW/316 hp), spotting a new single-disc manual gearbox cars, larger torque converter in automatics and fairly significant styling updates which gave the car a cleaner, sleeker look. S4 was much closer to being a truly world car than previous models as only major differences between ROW and US models were instrumentation in either kilometers or miles, lighting, front and rear bumper shocks and the availability of catalytic converters in many ROW markets. Australian market version was only one with different horsepower rating at 300 PS (221 kW/296 hp) due to preparation for possible low grade fuel. Even this was achieved without engine changes.

A Club Sport variant which was up to  lighter became available to continental Europe and USA in 1988. This model was watered down version of 1987 factory prototype which had lightened body and 10.9:1 compression ratio engine. Also in 1987 the factory made four white lightened manual gearbox S4 models for racecar drivers who were on their payroll at the time. These were close to same as later actual Club Sport models and can also be considered prototypes for it. An SE (sometimes called the S4 Sport due to model designation on rear bumper), a sort of halfway point between a normally equipped S4 and the more race-oriented Club Sport, became available to the UK. It's generally believed these Porsche Motorsport engined cars have more hp than the S4. They utilize parts which later became known as GT pistons, cams, engine ECU programs and a stronger, short geared manual gearbox. The automatic gearbox was not available.

For MY 1989 visible change inside was digital trip computer in ZF 40% limited-slip differential as standard like the Club Sport and SE before it. Also like the CS and SE, the GT was only available with a manual gearbox. ROW 1989 CS and GT wheels had an RDK tire pressure monitoring system as standard. This was also optional for the same year ROW S4. For MY 1990 Porsche made RDK and a 0-100% variable ratio limited-slip called PSD (Porsche SperrDifferential) standard in both GT and S4 models for all markets. This system is much like the one from the 959 and gives the vehicle even more grip. In 1990 the S4 was no longer available with a manual gearbox.

The S4 and GT variants were both cut at the end of MY 1991, making way for the final version of the 928. The 928 GTS came for sale in late 1991 as a 1992 model in Europe and in spring of 1992 as an early 1993 model in North America. Changed bodywork, larger front brakes and a new, more powerful 5.4 L, 350 PS (257 kW/345 hp) engine were the big advertised changes; what Porsche wasn't advertising was the price. Loaded GTS models could eclipse $100,000 USD in 1995, making them among the most expensive cars on the road at the time. This severely hampered sales despite the model's high competency and long standard equipment list. Porsche discontinued the GTS model that year after shipping only 77 of them to the United States. Total worldwide production for all years was a little over 61,000 cars.

Second-hand models' value decreased as a result of generally high maintenance costs due largely to spare parts that are expensive to manufacture. The earliest versions, however, especially those models with the Bosch K-Jetronic (CIS) injection system, have few electronic components and therefore can be repaired more easily provided spare parts can be found. Parts suppliers supported by various enthusiasts exist especially in the United States.  

The GTS model has retained a high value however, and as of 2006 the price for all variants is apparently starting to creep upwards (Classic Motorsports, March, 2006 issue, p. 38). A great community dedicated to the 928 exists online even today, and the car has won a huge fan base. The 928 was such a powerful vehicle in its day that even models 25+ years old are able to outperform current sport/grand-touring models of various manufacture. 

With the release of the Cayenne SUV, Porsche has met with renewed success with a front-engined, V8-powered model. The company's 2005 announcement that a new V8-powered 4-door grand tourer model called Panamera would be launched in 2009 fueled rumors and fan speculation of a reborn 928. Although the Panamera will be a 4-door model, Road and Track magazine published a speculative piece in their April 2006 issue in regards to the possibility of a new, 928-esque coupe that may debut on a shortened version of the Panamera's platform sometime around MY 2011 or 2012. Although feasible, this is pure speculation as of 2006. The article seemed to indicate a re-use of the 928 nameplate although Porsche's recent tendency to give non-numerical names to their vehicles and a desire to separate the vehicle from past models may preclude the possibility of calling the vehicle 928.

Also noteworthy is that there are several manufacturers of supercharger and turbo kits specifically for the 928. The stock engine for any year is capable of handling significant power increases without part failure. More owners have opted for supercharging their vehicles as the conversion is reasonably straight forward whereas the fitting of two turbo chargers on each of the exhaust manifolds has caused problems because of the lack of space.

==Styling changes==

Styling was the same from 1978 through 1979 and the body lacked both front and rear spoilers. From 1980 (1983 in North America) through 1986, front and rear spoilers were present on "S" models, rear spoilers were integrated into the hatch. From 1987 through 1995, the front spoiler is integrated into the nose and the rear spoiler became a separated wing rather than an integrated piece, and side skirts were added. The rear tail-light configuration was also different from previous versions. GTS model had wider rear fenders added to give more room for 9" wide wheels.

Another easily noticeable visual difference between versions is the style of the rims. Early 928s had 15" or 16" "phone dial"-style rims, while most 1980s 928s had 16" slotted "flat disc"s, CSs, SEs and 1989 GTs had 16" "Club Sport", later GTs had 16" "Design 90" style which were also option on same period S4s, the GTS used two variations of the 17" "CUP" rims.

==928 evolution==

The evolution of the 928 during its 18 years of production is quite subtle, and often confuses individuals interested in purchasing a 928. The tables below show the major differences, which were largely made to the nose, tail, interior, engine and rims.

left|30px|Logo de PorscheLa '''Porsche 928''' est un modèle de voiture de sport produit par le constructeur automobile Porsche.
La Porsche 928 est le premier modèle de la marque à recevoir un v8, installé en position avant. Son design particulièrement innovant, lui confère une allure moderne qui témoigne assez bien des tendances esthétiques de la fin des années 1970, début 1980. Le choix de la motorisation en fera une voiture "mal aimée" de bon nombre de Porschistes qui vouent un culte exclusif à la mythique 911 et à son fameux flat 6. La 928 connaîtra pourtant un certain succès, notamment aux Etats-Unis, marché auquel elle était prioritairement destinée, et bénéficiera d'un étonnante longévité, produite de 1978 à 1995. La future Panamera de Porsche, coupé 4 places, devrait redonner vie au concept de la GT "familiale" introduit par la 928. 

==Historique==
Elle est née de la volonté des dirigeants de l'époque, en particulier Ernst Fuhrman, le fameux créateur du 4 cylindres à plat double arbre des Porsche 550 et 718, de sortir de la monoculture 911 du constructeur de Stuttgart. En effet, il apparaît à cette époque que l'architecture "porte-à-faux arrière" a peu d'avenir, ce que l'avenir démentira. Les dirigeants de Porsche cherchent donc une alternative et optent pour le concept d'une GT à moteur à l'avant refroidi par eau.

Ainsi dès 1971, le projet 928 est lancé. Le chef designer est Anatole Lapine, un ancien de GM. C'est à lui que l'on doit la ligne quasi intemporelle de l'auto. Par ailleurs, les techniciens, pour des raisons d'équilibre, s'entendent pour repousser la boîte de vitesses sur l'essieu arrière. L'architecture est donc moteur à l'avant refroidi par eau, boîte de vitesses à l'arrière, reliés entre eux par arbre "rapide" (il tourne à la même vitesse que le vilebrequin) et s'appelle système Transaxle. 

==Aspect technique==
Par ailleurs, les techniciens se soucient aussi du comportement routier d'une propulsion de forte puissance. Après nombre de péripéties, ils mettent au point le premier essieu arrière multibras équipant une automobile de production. Cet essieu arrière à déformation programmée prendra le nom du centre de recherche Porsche : Weissach. Le principe de cet essieu arrière sera réutilisé bien plus tard sur la dernière des 911 "aircooled", la Porsche 993.

==Motorisation==
Au niveau motorisation, marché américain oblige, c'est le principe du V8 qui est retenu. Malheureusement, en 1973 survient la première crise du pétrole, et les prétentions du moteur sont revues à la baisse. On reste sur un V8 alimenté par une injection mécanique de type K-jetronic, mais dont la cylindrée est limitée à 4 499 cm³, et la puissance ne dépasse pas les 240 ch. Malgré tout, cette version aura une consommation de l'ordre de 15 l/100 km.

Après six ans de développement, la voiture est enfin prête, et sort à l'automne 1977. Elle est élue cette même année Voiture européenne de l'année 1978, première et seule GT à avoir obtenu cette distinction. Il faut dire que l'auto est une petite merveille de technologie et d'originalité. "Last but not least", certains éléments, comme les ailes et les panneaux de portes, sont en aluminium. L'équipement est très riche avec commande intérieure du réglage des phares, des rétroviseurs, fermeture centralisée, climatisation, etc.

Malgré tout, les 240 ch ne sont pas de trop pour propulser la lourde GT. C'est pourquoi, très rapidement, la gamme évoluera vers plus de puissance et plus d'équipement (quoique, sur ce dernier point, ce ne pourra qu'être marginal).
