Les '''dermaptères''' sont un ordre d'insectes qui comprend notamment les forficules ou perce-oreilles. On en connaît environ 1 300 espèces à travers le monde, dont un peu plus d'une trentaine en Europe.

Ce sont des insectes allongés munis de pinces abdominales (les forceps). Les pinces des mâles sont des  plus courbes que celles des femelles. Celles-ci sont d'ailleurs des armes défensives mais guère efficaces. Les perce-oreilles passent la plupart de leur temps dans les crevasses, le creux des fleurs.

Les forficules sont parmi les rares insectes dont la mère porte attention à sa progéniture. Elle ne se contente pas seulement de pondre les œufs pour les abandonner ensuite, mais elle reste à proximité de ceux-ci jusqu'à leur éclosion.

Les dermaptères (de ''derma'' : peau et ''ptera'' : aile) ont des ailes très fines ressemblant aux lambeaux d'épiderme qui pèlent après un coup de soleil. Elles sont repliées de façon très complexe sous de minuscules élytres.

'''Earwig''' is the common name given to the order '''Dermaptera''' characterized by membranous wings folded underneath short leathery forewings (hence the literal name of the order—"skin wings"). The cerci. With about 1,800 recorded species in 10 families, the order is relatively small among Insecta. Earwigs are, however, quite common globally. There is no evidence that they transmit disease or otherwise harm humans or other animals, despite their nickname ''pincher bug''. 

==Etymology==
''Earwig'' is derived from Old English ''ēare'' "ear" and ''wicga'', 'insect'. (''Wicga'' is in turn related to ''wiggle'', and ultimately to other words implying movement, including ''way'' and ''vehicle'', all from PIE *''wegh-''.)  The name comes from the old wives' tale that earwigs burrow into the brains of humans through the ear and therein lay their eggs.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'' on "Earwig".</ref> Earwigs are omnivores that are evolutionarily predisposed to hiding in warm humid crevices and as such one may crawl into a human ear canal. This is not, however, a location where they are frequently found. <ref>{{Citation

|title=Dermaptera &mdash; Earwigs
|author=Fabian Haas
|publisher=Tree of Life web project}}</ref> Nevertheless, Rod Serling created an episode of Night Gallery entitled "The Caterpillar" based on the earwig legend.

Other languages have words based on the same premise: German ''Ohrwurm'' (also: ''Ohrkneifer'', "ear pincher"), French ''perce-oreille'', Danish ''ørentviste'', Slovak ''ucholak'' (''ucho'' = ear, ''lak'' = scare), and Hungarian ''fülbemászó'' ("crawler-into-the-ear"). English has derived a verb from this, ''to earwig'', meaning "to fill someone's mind with prejudice by insinuations" or "to attempt to influence by persistent confidential argument or talk".<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=earwig dictionary.com: ''earwig'']</ref>
<!-- this is NOT synonymous with eavesdrop - source: OED !--> 
The German word ''Ohrwurm'' has the derived meaning "an annoying tune which I can't get out of my head" (see earworm). Hungarian also uses the phrase ''fülbemászó dallam'' with similar meaning as the German above, although without the negative overtones.

==Classification==
Four suborders within the Dermaptera have been established:

* '''Archidermaptera''': Has a fossil record extending into the Jurassic, with fossils from that period. These have unsegmented cerci and tarsi with 4-5 segments.
* '''Forficulina''': The largest and most familiar group.  The cerci are unsegmented, and modified into large, forcep-like structures.
* '''Hemimerina''': Represented by one genus, ''Hemimerus'', with filiform segmented cerci and are wingless, blind and viviparous ectoparasites of African rodents
* '''Arixenina''': Represented by two genera, ''Arixenia'' and ''Xeniaria''.  As with Hemimerina, they are blind, wingless ectoparasites with filiform segmented cerci.  They are ectoparasites of various Southeast Asian bats, particularly of the genus ''Cheiromeles'' (i.e., "naked bulldog bats").

==Appearance and behaviour==

Most earwigs are elongated, flattened, and are dark brown. Lengths are mostly in the 10–14&nbsp;mm range, with the apterous), the hindwings are folded in a complex fashion, so that they fit under the forewings.  Even though most species of winged earwigs are capable of flight, they rarely fly around.

The abdomen of the earwig is flexible and muscular. It is capable of maneuvering as well as opening and closing of the forceps. The forceps are used for a variety of purposes. In some species, the forceps have also been observed in use for holding prey, and in copulation. The forceps tend to be more curved in males than in females. 

Most earwigs found in Europe and North America are of the corn silk, damaging the corn. Typically they are a nuisance because of their diet, but normally do not present serious hazards to crops. Some tropical species are brightly colored. Occasionally earwigs are confused with cockroaches because of their cerci and their long antennae. 

Earwigs are generally nocturnal and can be seen patrolling household walls and ceilings. Interaction with earwigs at this time results in a defensive free fall to the ground below, and the subsequent scramble to a nearby cleft or crevice.
