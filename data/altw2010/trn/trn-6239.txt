'''''Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town''''' ('''''Bokujou Monogatari: Mineral Town no Nakama Tachi''''' in Natsume.  It was released in November of 2003.

The game follows along the same lines as the rest of the Harvest Moon series in which the player takes on the role of a farmer whose only goal in the game is to make a profit from the farm. This includes producing crops and raising livestock. The player can also marry one of the five women in the town or the Harvest Goddess. The setting of the story (Mineral Town) was also in another Harvest Moon game: Harvest Moon: Back to Nature.  Friends of Mineral Town is, in many ways, an enhanced GBA port of that game.

==Gameplay==

Initially there is very little on the farm, save some old tools.  The player must begin by clearing the large field on the farm of weeds, tree stumps, twigs, and rocks varying in size.  From there they must plant a variety of crops to earn money to buy other needed things, such as livestock, to help them run a successful farm.

The social aspect of FoMT, as in other Harvest Moon games, is a very large part of the game.  There are many villagers to befriend, and in doing so the player may unlock certain items and events that otherwise would be inaccessible.  There are six eligible bachelorettes to choose from, including the Harvest Goddess.  Once married, it is possible to have a son.

===Farming===
==== Livestock/animals ====
There are five different animals the player may take care of, these often provide a source of income and are taken care of in a manner unique to each type of animal.

===== Cows: =====
Cows may be purchased as calves from Barley's Farm, and are sent to the barn. Before you upgrade it, the barn may hold eight cows and/or sheep. After you upgrade it, 16 cows and/or sheep may be held in it. Cows are cared for by feeding them, brushing them, talking to them and letting them outside to graze on sunny days. When you first purchase your cow it will be too young to milk, but after a week it will be old enough to milk with the milker. The happier your cow is the higher the level of their milk, with the highest level being 'X Milk', which has a small chance of being produced by a 'P Milk' producing cow. Cows may also give birth if the player impregnates them with a 'Cow Miracle Potion'. If you leave it outside and there is no grass to graze on it will be unhappy, as will be if left in the rain or snow.

*Cow Festival: The player may enter their cow in the Cow Festival. The "best" cow is the winner, and if the player's cow wins it will receive a crown next to its name, which allows the cow to give 'Gold' and then 'P' milk.  'P Milk' can only be produced when a cow has spent a certain number of hours outdoors. Cows with high heart levels have a better chance of winning, as with sheep.

===== Chicken: =====
Chickens are the cheapest animal the character may purchase, and may be buy from the Poultry Farm. To care for them the player must pick them up, give them medicine when they're sick and feed them 'Chicken Feed'. Before the player upgrades their chicken coop they may have four chickens, after they upgrade it they may have eight. Chickens produce an egg every day. The better care you take of a chicken the better eggs it may lay, with the last level egg being the 'X Egg', which has a small chance of being produced by a 'P Egg' laying chicken. Players can purchase more chickens, but if an egg is placed in the incubator, a Chick will be born in a few days. The chick does not need food until it is grown up. This will save money and feed.If the player leaves chickens outside they collect their own food and don't need to be fed, but if they are left out unprotected past 8:00 pm then they may be attacked by wild dogs if they are not enclosed by a fence made of stones or lumber.

*Chicken Festival: The player may enter their chicken in the Chicken Festival, which allows them to play a mini-game in which the goal is to scare the opponents chicken off the edge of a platform. If a chicken wins this they get a crown next to their name, which allows the chicken to lay 'Gold' then 'P Eggs'.  'P Eggs' can only be produced if the chicken has spent 80 days outdoors.

===== Sheep: =====
Sheep may be purchased fully grown from Barley's Farm, and go to the barn. Before you upgrade it, the barn may hold eight cows and/or sheep. After you upgrade it 16 cows and/or sheep may be held in it. Sheep are cared for by feeding them, brushing them, talking to them and letting them outside to graze on sunny days. Sheep grow wool and may be shaved to sell their wool for money. It takes time for their wool to grow back. The happier a sheep is the higher the level of their wool, with the highest level being 'X Wool'.

*Sheep Festival: The player may enter their sheep in the Sheep Festival. The "best" sheep is the winner, and if the player's sheep wins it will receive a crown next to its name, enabling it to produce Golden Wool.

===== Horse: =====
After the player introduces themselves to Barley, he will eventually come and give the player a horse to take care of. If the player takes good care of the horse after a year, and accumulates four hearts, Barley will let them keep it, otherwise he will take it away for a year before giving the player another chance. You must raise it to at least six hearts, but if you don't you'll get it back with no hearts. The horse will be given to the player as a baby and in this stage all that can be done to take care of it is to brush it, leave it outside on sunny days, and talk to it every day. After one year it will mature and the player will be able to ride it around the farm, and during the horse races.
*Horse Race: After their horse matures the player may enter it into the horse race. If the horse wins it will get a crown next to its name, and also a Power Berry, which increases the player's stamina. Players may also place bets on the race.If the horse that you placed bet win, you will receive medals and you can exchange it with Thomas,the mayor at Rose square before or after everyone go home. You can change power berry with 999 medal that you received.

===== Dog: =====
The dog will not become sick.
You have to wait for two months (Spring and Summer) during the first year before turns from a puppy to a dog. Then, you can buy a frisbee (5,000G) from Won at Zack's house and also a ball(100G) to play with your dog.

====Tools====
The player will start off with an axe, hammer, watering can, sickle, and hoe. The fishing rod (which allows the player to catch fish in lakes, rivers, and the ocean) can also be obtained through an event in the game. After the player gains experience with the tools, he can take them to the black smith with the appropriate metal and have it upgraded, though to upgrade at some levels special tasks and items are required. For example, copper is needed for upgrading the first stage of tool, silver for second, gold for third, and mystrille for forth.(you can obtain these in spring mine). The watering can, sickle, and hoe are used to prepare land and maintain crops. The hammer, and hoe may also be used to mine ore and precious jewels. The axe may be used to chop branches and clear stumps, allowing you to acquire lumber, used to upgrade your house, barn, chicken coop, and to build fences and other things.

====Cooking====
After upgrading their house the player may purchase a kitchen from the TV shopping network. They may then purchase various cooking utensils including a pot, whisk, knife, frying pan etc. In total there are 8 kinds of utensils which may be used for cooking, but sometimes you might fail in cooking and turned out to be some burnt food. Unlike many previous Harvest Moon games recipes in FoMT can actually be made. There are three sources of recipes.

==Characters==
Harvest Moon Friends of Mineral Town features many characters. They live either in Mineral Town, or the immediately surrounding area. All of them may be befriended by giving them gifts, and talking to them often. There is often a reward for becoming friends with someone like a gift, access to an area of their 'home', or helping you on the farm. 

===Bachelorettes===
The player has the option of marrying one of six prospective wives who reside in Mineral Town. First, the player must woo her (which involves giving her gifts she likes, attending festivals with her, and visiting her often), then propose using a blue feather [which costs 1,000]. The following is a list of the characters in the game who are eligible for marriage.
