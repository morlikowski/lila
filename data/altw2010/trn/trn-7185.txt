== 生涯 ==
1919年、ロー・スクールを修了し、法曹界に入る。

民主党候補を降して当選を果たす。彼はアフリカ系アメリカ人として初めて一般投票で選出された人物であり、南北戦争後の再建期以降初のアフリカ系上院議員である。彼の後アフリカ系として選出されたのはキャロル・モスリー・ブラウン、バラック・オバマ（共にイリノイ州選出、民主党)の2人である。

1967年には、ジョンソン大統領の社会不安（主に様々な社会運動の過激化）に関する諮問委員会のメンバーに選ばれるなど、検事総長時代の経験を生かした。いわゆる「ニクソン政権の経済政策、外交政策には概ね賛同するものの、社会政策を中心に政権に反発することもしばしばであった。最も顕著な例は、大統領の指名した最高裁判事、ハロルド・カーズウェルの承認に反対票を投じたことである。ちなみにカーズウェルの承認自体も、民主党と共和党の一部議員により阻まれた。1972年には共和党大会における基調演説者となり、また62%対34%の大差で再選された。だが、二期目に彼は自身の離婚問題を抱え、この問題は継続的に、広く報道された。その結果彼は広範な支持を失い、1978年の改選の際には、民主党のポール・ソンガス下院議員に55%対45%で敗れた。

'''Edward William Brooke III''' (born American Republican from Democratic opponent, Democrat Carol Moseley Braun in 1993.  

==Early years==
Brooke was born in 366th Infantry Regiment and saw combat in Italy. Following his discharge, he graduated from Boston University Law School in 1948.

The following year, he ran for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, but lost.  He then made two more tries for office, including one for secretary of state, but again fell short in both races.

He was the chairman of Finance Commission of Boston from 1961 to 1962.  Brooke was elected Attorney General of Massachusetts in 1962 and re-elected in 1964.  In this position, he gained a reputation as a vigorous prosecutor of organized crime, and coordinated with local police departments on the Boston strangler case.<ref>Boston Strangler coordination: [http://www.wbur.org/news/2007/64669_20070219.asp WBUR interview]</ref>

==U.S. Senator==
Brooke served as a U.S. senator for two terms, from President's Commission on Civil Disorders.  He was a member of the liberal wing of the Republican Party and organized the Senate's "Wednesday Club" of progressive Republicans who met for Wednesday lunches and strategy discussions. Brooke, who had supported New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's bid for the  1968 G.O.P. Presidential nomination against Nixon's, often differed with President Richard Nixon on matters of social policy and civil rights.

By his second year in the Senate, Brooke had taken his place as a leading advocate against discrimination in housing and on behalf of affordable housing. With fellow 1968 Fair Housing Act which President Johnson signed into law a week after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 11, 1968. Dissatisfied with the weakened enforcement provisions that emerged from the legislative process, Brooke repeatedly proposed stronger provisions during his Senate career. In 1969, Congress enacted the "Brooke Amendment" to the federal publicly-assisted housing program which limited the tenants' out-of-pocket rent expenditure to 25% of his or her income. By the 1990s, the percentage had gradually increased, but the principle of limiting the housing 'burden' of very-low income renters survives in statute, as of 2008.

During the Nixon years, Brooke opposed repeated Administration attempts to close down the Legal Services Corporation, the Job Corps, the Office of Economic Opportunity and to weaken the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission - all foundational elements of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.

In 1969, Brooke was a leader of the bi-partisan coalition that defeated the Senate confirmation of the President's nominee to the Supreme Court, Clement F. Haynesworth, Jr. A few months later, he again organized sufficient Republican support to defeat Nixon's second Supreme Court nominee Harrold Carswell. 

In 1970, the Senate adopted his resolution prohibiting tests of MIRV missiles. 

Brooke was re-elected in 1972, defeating Democrat John J. Droney 62%-34%. 

Before the first year of his second term ended, Brooke became the first Republican to call on President Nixon to resign, on November 4, 1973 shortly after the Watergate-related "Saturday night massacre". He had risen to become the Ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee and on two powerful Appropriations Committees, Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS) and Foreign Operations. From these positions, Brooke defended and strengthened the programs he identified with; for example, he was a leader in enactment of the Equal Credit Act which ensured married women a right to credit of their own.

In 1974, together with Indiana Senator Birch Bayh, he led the fight to retain Title IX of the 1972 Education Act which guarantees equal educational opportunity to girls and women.

In 1975, with the extension and expansion of the Voting Rights Act at stake, Brooke faced Senator John Stennis (D-MS) in "extended debate" and won the Senate's support for the extension.

In 1976, he also took on the role of champion for a woman's right to an abortion. The Appropriations bill for HHS became the battleground over this issue because it funds Medicaid. The foes of abortion rights fought, eventually successfully, to prohibit funding for abortions of low-income women insured by Medicaid. Brooke led the fight against restrictions in the Senate Appropriations Committee and in the House-Senate Conference until his defeat.

In Massachusetts, Brooke's support among Catholics weakened, and during the 1978 re-election campaign, the state's bishops spoke in opposition to his leading role, in spite of the equally pro-choice position of his Democratic opponent. In addition, he was challenged in the Republican primary by a hard-line conservative talk show host, Avi Nelson. He lost some of his personal popularity during his second term after a contentious and widely-publicized Senate elections of 1978 to Paul Tsongas.  He remains, as of 2008, the last Republican senator from Massachusetts.
