The '''British turboprop passenger aircraft.

==Development==
In the mid 1950s, The pioneering Handley Page Aircraft Company founded by Sir Frederick Handley-Page, developed a new fast short-range feederliner, intended to replace the venerable Douglas DC-3. The design, originally known as the HPR-3 Herald, emanated from the drawing office at Handley Page (Reading) Limited - the former Miles Aircraft factory site, which developed an earlier design; the Miles Marathon. The Herald was an extensive development of the original concept of the Marathon, notably its high mounted wing. The HP Reading division succeeded in producing a modern design, which had excellent flight and performance characteristics. However, the company made a serious misjudgment, and the Herald missed its chance, like other classic British aircraft of the time.

As the HPR-3, the Herald was originally configured with four Alvis Leonides Major piston engines of 870 hp (650 kW) each, driving conventional three-bladed props. By now, however, the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engine had shown proven success in the Vickers Viscount. HP failed to take early account of this in the Herald design phase; particularly the market desire for the new turboprops. This misjudgment and the ensuing delay was to prove a costly mistake for the company.

However, the Herald was advanced in many ways for the time. Its 1955. Although Queensland Airlines, Australian National Airways, and Lloyd Aereo Colombiano had initially placed 29 orders, these were later cancelled with only the first prototype completed. As a result Handley Page belatedly realised it had to make a major change to the engine configuration, if the Herald was to have any chance in the market.

There had already been a very substantial investment in the Herald project, such that the Management held a meeting to discuss continuation. Handley Page decided to press ahead with the Herald project, in an effort to recover the investment; announcing a new uprated version, reworking the wing to use 1958. Now designated the '''HPR-7 Dart Herald''', the new aircraft entered production in 1959. The first order being placed by BEA.

The Herald attracted much early interest around the world because of its astonishing short field performance and excellent flight characteristics, but Handley Page failed to close many of the deals, as the F-27, and the HS748 had become rival offerings, both of which were significantly cheaper. There has been some speculation about the origin of the F-27 design, which first flew earlier than the Herald in turboprop configuration. A key design feature of the Herald was the high mounted wing but notably with an upswept dihedral. In addition, the Herald's vertical fin is covered in miniature aerofoils, adding further to the Herald's excellent stability.

Pilots reported the Herald flew like a dream; very stable in the air, yet highly manoeuverable even at slow speed. Ground handling was said to be the Herald's only vice due to an overlarge tail fin. Credit for the Herald's useful wing and aerofoil features was due to the company's wing design office, which had garnered an unrivalled reputation for advanced wing design, including the crescent wing of the Victor bomber. Handley-Page invented the Slot, later referred to as the Handley-Page Slot, without which most modern aircraft would not be nearly so easy to manage at slow speeds.

Despite the rework, that transformed the HPR-3 to the HPR-7 Herald, only four of the original 47 seat Series 100 HPR-7s were built. Believing a yet larger version was needed, HP turned to Series 200 production, which featured a further 40 inch (1.07 m) stretch of the fuselage, seating up from 47 to 56 and corresponding increased weights. Series 200 Production began in 1961. The first production model was delivered to 1962. However, by this point all sales momentum had been lost, and only 36 examples of this major production model were eventually built during the six years of production.

The Herald 400 was specially developed in 1964 as a "tactical transport" built for the Royal Malaysian Air Force, with a strengthened cabin floor. HP suspected that the Herald was still too small and so a 60-seater series 700, powered by Dart 532's and having increased fuel and weights was designed.

A late attempt was made to revive sales when speculative production commenced on 8 series 700 airframes. The project was cancelled as several of the airframes were approaching completion. The partially completed airframes were scrapped. The 50th, and last, Herald (a series 200 for Israel's 1968, after which Herald production ceased and attention turned to the Jetstream 137.

It is widely thought that the misjudgments made during the Herald project, necessitating major design changes so late in the design cycle, was to prove the company's fatal mistake. Moreover, HP had been doggedly independent throughout its history. The UK Government favoured placing orders for military and civilian aircraft with the newly nationalised aircraft constructors, combined under the name British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). Sir Frederick Handley-Page was very much against nationalisation. Even after his death in 1962, the company continued to plough on as an independent constructor. But this policy saw HP lose out to BAC in military and civilian orders by Government, with the notable exception of the HP Victor, which sold on its undoubted merit.

The demise of Handley-Page was unfortunate. The company made a series of catastrophic errors, not least of which, was failing to judge the changing needs of the airlines that expressed early interest in the Herald. The company did not have the stomach to press ahead in a difficult economic climate effectively competing with a much larger company. Development of the Herald had proven to be an extremely expensive project. Despite much hope over the Jetream 137, and possible new variants of the Herald, with eight speculative builds at various stages of completion, Management made the difficult but brave decision to wind the company up.

Handley Page went into voluntary liquidation on the close of its books on 31 March 1970. The profitable HP137 Jetstream operation and drawing and design staff were the only useful parts of Handley-Page left, but it was not enough for the company to survive as Handley-Page. The Jetstream operation was sold and transferred to Scottish Aviation, later to become a subsidiary called Jetstream Aviation. This company was later acquired by and absorbed into BAe. The Jetstream went on to be a successful commuter offering.

The Herald's last ever passenger flight was operated by British Air Ferries in 1987 doing subcharters for Ryanair on the Waterford-Luton route. A durable & reliable aircraft, capable of being heavily worked, many continued on as freighters, plying the night sky across Britain and the near continent, for several operators including Royal Mail, BAF, Channel Express, DHL, Elan, Securicor & others; transporting papers, milk, parcels, post, tomatoes, flowers, and other goods round the clock. Some aircraft were in a specially convertible configuration, flying passengers by day and goods all night, but by 1999 the only one remaining in service, was a series 400 [G-BEYF] with Channel Express; it was retired at the end of March that year. The most similar design in service today is the DeHavilland Canada / Bombardier DASH-8; a similarly configured twin turboprop STOL which also employs a high mounted high lift wing.

'''ハンドレページ ダートヘラルド'''（Handley Page Dart Herald）とはターボプロップ双発旅客機である。

== 概略 ==
1950年代には、ダグラスDC-3の後継となる短距離用旅客機を開発する計画が世界各地の航空機メーカーで進められていた。

イギリスのハンドレページも、Alvis Leonides Majorレシプロエンジン（870馬力）4発で与圧胴体を持ち、乗客44名を搭乗することができる原型機”H.P.R.3 Herald”通称'''ハンドレページ・ヘラルド'''（機体記号:G-AODE）を1955年8月25日に初飛行させた。しかし、この機体は既に時代遅れであり、オーストラリアナショナル航空などからの29機の発注がキャンセルされてしまった。

そのため、ハンドレページはレシプロエンジン搭載型の開発計画を破棄し、ターボプロップエンジンであるロールス・ロイス ダート搭載型にするため再設計した。この機体は20インチ（50.8ｃｍ）延長され、1958年に初飛行した。そのため、改めてこの機体は、H.P.R.7 Dart Herald、通称'''ハンドレページ・ダートヘラルド'''と命名され、1959年から生産が開始された。

しかし、ダートヘラルドのようにロールスロイス・ダートを搭載した競合機には、イギリスのアブロ 748、オランダのフォッカー F27,そして日本のYS-11など多数があり、商業的に苦戦した。そのため、多くの派生型が作られたが後期になると、発注がキャンセルされることもあり、1968年8月に通算50期目かつ最期の機体がイスラエルの航空会社に引き渡された。その翌年にハンドレページは倒産した。皮肉なことに、ダートヘラルドが現役から引退したのは2000年のことであり、比較的長寿の機体が多かった。
