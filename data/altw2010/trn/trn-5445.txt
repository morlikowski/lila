'''''Kaga''''' (''Tosa'' sınıfı hızlı bir zırhlı olarak tasarlamış bir uçak gemisidir. Pearl Harbor saldırısında görev almış ve 4 Haziran 1942 tarihinde Midway savaşında batırılmıştır<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-fornv/japan/japsh-k/kaga.htm Kaga @] www.history.navy.mil</ref>

''Kaga'' 'nın yapımına 1921 yılında Kawasaki Ağır Endüstrinin Kobe'deki tersanelerinde ''Tosa'' sınıfı bir zırhlı olarak başlanmıştır. Fakat Japonyanın 1922 yılında Washington Donanma Antlaşmasını imzalamasıyla ''Tosa'' sınıfı zırhlıların yapılması engellenmiş ve sökülmek üzere ayrılmıştır. Arkasından 1923 yılındaki Büyük Kanto Depreminin bitmemiş ''Amagi'' uçak gemisini ( zırhlı omurgasından dönüştürülmüş bir gemiydi) yok etmesiyle ''Kaga'' onun yerini almak üzere seçildi. 

1930larda ''Kaga'', Çin'e düzenlenen operasyonları destekledi ve Shanghai Olayında ve İkinci  Çin - Japon Savaşı sırasında yer aldı.

''Arizona'', ''Vestal'', ''Tennessee'', ''West Virginia'', ''Oklahoma'', ve ''Nevada'''yı, 9 ''Maryland'', ve ''West Virginia'' gemileriydi.

1942 Ocağında yine ''Akagi'' ile beraber  USS ''Peary''.'nin de içinde bulunduğu 9 geminin  batmasına neden oldu. Mart 1942'de ise Java adasına yapılan saldırıyı da koruma görevini üstlendi.
''Kaga'' Nisan ayındaki Sasebo'ya tamiratlar için geri döndü.

Saat 14:10'da USS ''Nautilus'' denizaltısı Kagayı bir torpido ile vurdu fakat torpido patlamadı ve Kaga'ya bir zarar vermedi.

''Kaga'' 'nın kurtulan mürettebatı ''Hakigaze'' ve ''Maikaze'' destroyerleri tarafından denizden toplandı ve saat 19:45'de ''Kage'' gövdesinde patlayan iki torpido ile battı.

'''''Kaga''''' (Japanese: 加賀, formerly ''Tosa'' class fast Pearl Harbor raid and was sunk at the Battle of Midway on 4 June 1942.<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-fornv/japan/japsh-k/kaga.htm] Kaga at www.history.navy.mil</ref>

''Kaga'' began as a ''Tosa'' class battleship, and was launched on 17 November 1921 at the Kawasaki Heavy Industries shipyard in Kobe. On 5 February 1922 both ''Tosa'' class ships were cancelled and designated for scrapping under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

The Treaty authorized conversion of two battleship or battlecruiser hulls into aircraft carriers of up to 33,000 tons standard displacement. The incomplete battlecruisers ''Amagi'' and ''Akagi'' were initially selected, but the Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923 damaged ''Amagi's'' hull beyond economic repair. ''Kaga'' was therefore selected for completion as an aircraft carrier.

''Kaga's'' conversion began in 1923 and lasted until 1928. As completed, the ship had two main hangar decks and a third auxiliary hangar with a total capacity of 60 aircraft. The hangars opened onto two superimposed flying off decks at the bow. In theory, this permitted aircraft to take off directly from the hangars, while landing on the main flight deck above. Funnel gasses were collected in a pair of long horizontal ducts which discharged at each side of the flight deck ramp. ''Kaga'' was armed with ten 200&nbsp;mm (7.9&nbsp;in) guns in a combination of twin turrets and casemates. Belt and deck armor were considerably reduced. No catapults were fitted.<ref name=ireland />

Upon completion, ''Kaga'' underwent trials for another two years before becoming operational. In service, the multiple flight deck arrangement proved unsuccessful. In 1934, ''Kaga'' therefore commenced a second major reconstruction. The flight deck and hangars were extended to the bow, increasing flight deck length to 812.5 ft and raising aircraft capacity to 90. A third elevator serviced the extended hangars. New boilers and turbines increased power from 91,000 to 127,400&nbsp;shp. The hull was lengthened by 34 ft at the stern and the lengthy funnel ducting was replaced by a single downturned starboard funnel. A small starboard island superstructure was also installed.<ref name=ireland></ref> Standard displacement increased by almost 9,000 tons, from 29,600 to 38,200 tons.
  
''Kaga'' returned to service in 1935. During the late 1930s ''Kaga'' supported operations in China, and was involved in the Shanghai Incident and during the early years of the Second Sino-Japanese War. 

At the beginning of ''Akagi'' she formed Carrier Division 1 of the Striking Force for the ''Arizona'', ''Vestal'', ''Tennessee'', ''West Virginia'', ''Oklahoma'', and ''Nevada'', and 9 Hickam Field. In her second strike, 23 ''Maryland'', and ''West Virginia''.

In January 1942, together with ''Akagi'', ''Kaga'' supported the invasion of Rabaul in the air strikes against Darwin, Australia, sinking nine ships, including USS ''Peary''. In March 1942, ''Kaga'' covered the invasion of Java.

''Kaga'' was unable to participate in the Sasebo for repairs.

In May 1942, ''Kaga'' sailed on her final mission. Her aircraft complement was 30 "Zeros," 23 "Vals," and 30 "Kates." <ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq81-6.htm] Battle of Midway at www.history.navy.mil</ref> On USS ''Enterprise'' hit her with at least four 1000&nbsp;lb (453.6&nbsp;kg) bombs, which set off explosions and fires among the armed and fueled planes on her hangar deck. Captain Okada was killed by a bomb that hit the bridge. The fires proved impossible to control and the order to abandon ship was given at about 14:00.<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-fornv/japan/japsh-k/kaga.htm] Kaga at www.history.navy.mil</ref>

At 14:10 the submarine USS ''Nautilus'' hit ''Kaga'' with a ''Hagikaze'' and ''Maikaze'', and at 19:25 she was scuttled by two torpedoes and sank at position .

In 1999, the Nauticos company discovered wreckage that has been identified as coming from ''Kaga''.
