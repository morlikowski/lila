[http://cougar.eb.com/soundc11/m/metham01.wav '''Methamphetamine'''] (, a.k.a.'''methylpsychostimulant and sympathomimetic drug. The recreational purposes.

Methamphetamine enters the cascading release of dopaminergic and adrenergic mesolimbic reward pathway, causing euphoria and excitement, it is prone to abuse and addiction.  
Users may become obsessed or perform repetitive tasks such as cleaning, hand-washing, or assembling and disassembling objects.  Withdrawal is characterized by excessive sleeping, eating, and depression-like symptoms, often accompanied by anxiety and drug-craving.<ref></ref> Users of methamphetamine sometimes take sedatives such as benzodiazepines as a means of easing their "come down".

Common nicknames for methamphetamine include "meth", "ice", "crystal", "tina", "p", and "glass". Methamphetamine is sometimes referred to as "speed", but this term is usually used for regular amphetamine or dextroamphetamine.

==History==
Methamphetamine was first synthesized from ephedrine in Japan in 1893 by chemist Nagayoshi Nagai.<ref>{{cite journal|author =Nagai N.|title = Kanyaku maou seibun kenkyuu seiseki (zoku)|journal= Yakugaku
Zashi |year=1893|volume= 13|pages= 901}}</ref> In 1919, crystallized methamphetamine was synthesized by Akira Ogata via reduction of ephedrine using red phosphorus and iodine. The related compound amphetamine was first synthesized in Germany in 1887 by Lazăr Edeleanu.

====World War II====
One of the earliest uses of methamphetamine was during World War II when the German military dispensed it under the trade name '''Pervitin'''.<ref name=Pervitin></ref>  It was widely distributed across rank and division, from elite forces to tank crews and aircraft personnel. Chocolates dosed with methamphetamine were known as Fliegerschokolade ("flyer's chocolate") when given to pilots, or Panzerschokolade ("tanker's chocolate") when given to tank crews.  From 1942 until his death in 1945, Adolf Hitler was given frequent intravenous injections of methamphetamine by his personal physician, Theodor Morell as a treatment for depression and fatigue. It is possible that it was used to treat Hitler's speculated Parkinson's disease, or that his Parkinson-like symptoms which developed from 1940 onwards were related to use of methamphetamine.<ref></ref>

====Post-war use====

After World War II, a large supply of amphetamine, formerly stockpiled by the Japanese military, became available in Japan under the street name shabu (also Philopon, pronounced ヒロポン, or Hiropon, a tradename)<ref name=Philopon></ref>. The Japanese Ministry of Health banned it in 1951; and its prohibition is thought to have added to the growing yakuza-activities related to illicit drug production.<ref name=banning_in_1951></ref> Today, methamphetamine is still associated with the Japanese underworld, but its usage is discouraged by strong social taboos.

In the 1950s there was a rise in the legal prescription of methamphetamine to the American public.  According to the 1951 edition of ''Pharmacology and Therapeutics'' by encephalitic Parkinsonism, alcoholism, ... in certain depressive states... and in the treatment of obesity."

The 1960s saw the start of significant use of clandestinely manufactured methamphetamine as well as methamphetamine created in users' own homes for personal use. The recreational use of methamphetamine peaked in the 1980s. The December 2, 1989 edition of ''The Economist'' described San Diego, California as the "methamphetamine capital of North America."

In 2000, ''The Economist'' again described San Diego, California as the methamphetamine capital of North America, and South Gate, California as the second capital city.

====Legal restrictions====
In 1983 laws were passed in the United States prohibiting possession of precursors and equipment for methamphetamine production; this was followed a month later by a bill passed in Canada enacting similar laws. In 1986 the U.S. government passed the Federal Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act in an attempt to curb the growing use of designer drugs. Despite this, or perhaps in part because of this, usage of methamphetamine expanded throughout rural United States, especially through the Midwest and South.

Since 1989 five U.S. federal laws and dozens of state laws have been imposed in an attempt to curb the production of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine can be produced in home laboratories using pseudoephedrine or ephedrine, the active ingredients in over-the-counter drugs such as Sudafed and Contac. However, preventative legal strategies of the past 17 years have steadily increased restrictions to the distribution of pseudoephedrine/ephedrine-containing products. 

As a result of the U.S. Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, a subsection of the PATRIOT Act, there are restrictions on the amount of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine one may purchase in a specified time period, and further requirements that these products must be stored in order to prevent theft.<ref>Cunningham JK, Liu LM. (2003) Impacts of Federal ephedrine and pseudoephedrine regulations on methamphetamine-related hospital admissions. Addiction, 98, 1229&ndash;1237.</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Methamphetamine is a potent central nervous system stimulant which affects neurochemical mechanisms responsible for regulating heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, appetite, attention, mood and responses associated with alertness or alarm conditions.
The acute effects of the drug closely resemble the physiological and psychological effects of an bronchodilation, and hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar). Users experience an increase in focus, increased mental alertness, and the elimination of fatigue, as well as a decrease in appetite.

The methyl group is responsible for the potentiation of effects as compared to the related compound amphetamine, rendering the substance on the one hand more lipid soluble and easing transport across the blood brain barrier, and on the other hand more stable against enzymatic degradation by MAO.
Methamphetamine causes the NE:DA = 1:2, NE:5HT= 1:60), causing increased stimulation of post-synaptic receptors. Methamphetamine also indirectly prevents the reuptake of these neurotransmitters, causing them to remain in the synaptic cleft for a prolonged period (inhibiting monoamine reuptake in rats with ratios of about: NE:DA = 1:2.35, NE:5HT = 1:44.5<ref>Rothman, et al. "Amphetamine-Type Central Nervous System Potently than they Release Dopamine and Serotonin." (2001): Synapse ''39'', 32-41 (Table V. on page 37)</ref>).

Methamphetamine is a potent neurotoxin, shown to cause dopaminergic degeneration.<ref></ref><!-- This corresponds to a human equivalent dose of at least 100 mg! Even higher on a simple mg/kg basis, which is probably a better measure for acute toxicity. --><ref></ref> High doses of methamphetamine produce losses in several markers of brain dopamine and serotonin neurons. Dopamine and serotonin concentrations, dopamine and 5HT uptake sites, and tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase activities are reduced after the administration of methamphetamine. It has been proposed that dopamine plays a role in methamphetamine induced neurotoxicity because experiments which reduce dopamine production or block the release of dopamine decrease the toxic effects of methamphetamine administration. When dopamine breaks down it produces reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. It is likely that the oxidative stress that occurs after taking methamphetamine mediates its neurotoxicity. <ref></ref> It has been demonstrated that a high ambient temperature increases the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine.<ref></ref>

Recent research published in the Journal of Pharmacology And Experimental Therapeutics (2007) [http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/321/1/178], indicates that methamphetamine binds to a group of receptors called TAAR. TAAR is a newly discovered receptor system which seems to be affected by a range of amphetamine-like substances called trace amines.

====Effects====
''Common immediate effects.'':<ref>[http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim334.htm#SectionTitle:2.2%20%20Summary%20of%20clinical%20effects Methamphetamine - Summary of clinical effects]</ref>
* Euphoria
* Increased energy and attentiveness
* Diarrhea, nausea
* Excessive sweating
* Loss of appetite, insomnia, tremor, jaw-clenching (Bruxism)
* Agitation, compulsive fascination with repetitive tasks (Punding)
* Talkativeness, irritability, panic attacks
* Increased libido

''Side effects associated with chronic use'':
* Drug craving
* Weight loss
* Withdrawal-related depression and anhedonia
* Rapid tooth decay ("meth mouth") (often exacerbated by resultant poor dental hygiene)
* Amphetamine psychosis
* Dopamine receptor downregulation and hypersensitization
* Axonic degeneration of the dopamine axon terminals in the striatum, frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala

''Side effects associated with overdose'':
* Brain damage/ Meningitis (Neurotoxicity) 
* Formication (sensation of flesh crawling with bugs, with possible associated compulsive picking and infecting  sores)
* Paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, which may trigger a tension headache
* Rhabdomyolysis (Muscle breakdown) which leads to Kidney failure 

Death from overdose is usually due to stroke, heart failure, but can also be caused by cardiac arrest (sudden death) or hyperthermia. 
<!-- See PIM -->

Buffenstein et al. (1997) showed through SPECT scanning of methamphetamine abusers in Hawaii that brain deterioration continues for months after abstinence, possibly suggesting another unique and pathological feature of methamphetamine.

====Pharmacokinetics====
The half life of methamphetamine is 9&ndash;15 hours. It is excreted by the kidneys and its half life depends on urinary pH. One of the metabolites of methamphetamine is amphetamine. <ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=12507968&query_hl=4&itool=pubmed_docsum Methamphetamine and amphetamine pharmacokinetics in oral fluid and plasma after controlled oral methamphetamine administration to human volunteers.]</ref>

====Tolerance====
As with other amphetamines, tolerance to methamphetamine is not completely understood, but known to be sufficiently complex that it cannot be explained by any single mechanism. The extent of tolerance and the rate at which it develops varies widely between individuals, and even within one person it is highly dependent on dosage, duration of use and frequency of administration. Many cases of narcolepsy are treated with methamphetamine for years without escalating doses or any apparent loss of effect.

Short term tolerance can be caused by depleted levels of downregulate in order to compensate for increased levels of dopamine within the synaptic cleft.<ref></ref> To compensate, larger quantities of the drug are needed in order to achieve the same level of effects.

====Addiction====

Methamphetamine is 12 Step meetings, such as Crystal Meth Anonymous.

Methamphetamine-induced hyperstimulation of pleasure pathways leads to L-5HTP/Tryptophan can aid in the recovery process by making it easier for the body to reverse the depletion of Dopamine, Norepinephrine, and Serotonin. Although studies involving the use of these amino acids have shown some success, this method of recovery has not been shown to be consistently effective. 

It is shown that taking ascorbic acid prior to using methamphetamine may help reduce acute toxicity to the brain, as rats given the human equivalent of 5-10 grams of ascorbic acid 30 minutes prior to methamphetamine dosage had toxicity mediated<ref>Wagner GC, Carelli RM, Jarvis MF. "Pretreatment with ascorbic acid attenuates the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine in rats." ''Research Communications in Chemical Pathology and Pharmacology''. 1985 Feb;'''47'''(2):221-8. PMID 3992009</ref><ref>Wagner GC, Carelli RM, Jarvis MF. "Ascorbic acid reduces the dopamine depletion induced by methamphetamine and the 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium ion." ''Neuropharmacology''. 1986 May;'''25'''(5):559-61. PMID 3488515</ref>, yet this will likely be of little avail in solving the other serious behavioral problems associated with methamphetamine use and addiction that many users experience. Large doses of ascorbic acid also lower urinary pH, reducing methamphetamine's elimination half-life and thus decreasing the duration of its actions.<ref>Oyler JM, Cone EJ, Joseph RE Jr, Moolchan ET, Huestis MA. [http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/full/48/10/1703 "Duration of detectable methamphetamine and amphetamine excretion in urine after controlled oral administration of methamphetamine to humans."] ''Clinical Chemistry''. 2002 Oct;'''48'''(10):1703-14. PMID 12324487.</ref>

To combat addiction, doctors are beginning to use other forms of amphetamine such as dextroamphetamine to break the addiction cycle in a method similar to the use of methadone in the treatment of heroin addicts. There are no publicly available drugs comparable to naloxone, which blocks opiate receptors and is therefore used in treating opiate dependence, for use with methamphetamine problems.<ref>The Ice Age (See Below)</ref> However, experiments with some monoamine reuptake inhibitors such as indatraline have been successful in blocking the action of methamphetamine.<ref>Rothman RB, Partilla JS, Baumann MH, Dersch CM, Carroll FI, Rice KC. "Neurochemical Neutralization of Methamphetamine With High-Affinity Nonselective Inhibitors of Biogenic Amine Transporters: A Pharmacological Strategy for Treating Stimulant Abuse." ''Synapse'' 2000 Mar 1;'''35'''(3):222-7. PMID 10657029</ref> There are studies indicating that fluoxetine, bupropion and imipramine may reduce craving and improve adherence to treatment.<ref name="pmid17990840"></ref> Research has also suggested that modafinil can help addicts quit methamphetamine use.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Since the phenethylamine phentermine is a constitutional isomer of methamphetamine, it has been speculated that it may be effective in treating methamphetamine addiction.  Although phenteremine is a central nervous stimulant that acts on dopamine and norepinephrine, it has not been reported to cause the same degree of euphoria that is associated with other amphetamines.

Abrupt interruption of chronic methamphetamine use results in the withdrawal syndrome in almost 90% of the cases. Withdrawal of amphetamine often causes a depression which is longer and deeper than even the depression from cocaine withdrawal.<ref name="pmid17990840" />

==Natural occurrence==
thumb|right|200px|''Acacia berlandieri'' Tree
Methamphetamine occurs naturally in ''Acacia berlandieri'' and possibly ''Acacia rigidula'', trees which grow in west Texas. Acacia trees contain numerous other psychoactive compounds (ex.amphetamine, mescaline, nicotine, DMT, ...<ref>BA Clement, CM Goff, TDA Forbes, Phytochemistry Vol.49, No 5, pp1377&ndash;1380 (1998)
"Toxic amines and alkaloids from Acacia rigidula"</ref>), but scientific papers specifically mentioning the presence of methamphetamine did not exist until 1997 and 1998.<ref>[http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/shulgin/adsarchive/acacia.htm Ask Dr. Shulgin Online: Acacias and Natural Amphetamine]</ref>

==Medical use==
d-Methamphetamine is used medically under the brand name Desoxyn for the following conditions:
* Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;
* Extreme obesity;
* Narcolepsy
thumb|right|10 mg Desoxyn
Because of its social stigma and toxicity, Desoxyn is not generally prescribed for ADHD unless other stimulants, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), lisdexamphetamine (Vyvanse) or mixed amphetamines (Adderall) have failed.

A new study by a group of University of Montana scientists showed that methamphetamine appears to lessen damage to the brains of rats and gerbils that have suffered strokes. The researchers found that small amounts of meth created a protective effect, while higher doses increased damage. The work is preliminary, and more research is needed to confirm and expand the findings; however, U.M. research assistant professor Dave Poulsen said someday humans may use meth to lessen stroke damage.<ref></ref>

== Health issues ==

In an article about his son's addiction to methamphetamine, California writer and former methamphetamine user David Schiff said "This drug has a unique, horrific quality."  In an interview, Stephan Jenkins, the singer in the band Third Eye Blind, said that methamphetamine makes you feel "bright and shiny."
<blockquote>It also makes you paranoid, incoherent and both destructive and pathetically and relentlessly ''self''-destructive.  Then you will do unconscionable things in order to feel bright and shiny again.<ref>David Sheff, "My Addicted Son," ''New York Times Magazine'', February 6, 2005, p. 44</ref></blockquote>

====Meth mouth====

Methamphetamine addicts may lose their teeth abnormally quickly, a condition known as "meth mouth". This effect is not caused by any corrosive effects of the drug itself, which is a common myth. According to the American Dental Association, meth mouth "is probably caused by a combination of drug-induced psychological and physiological changes resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth), extended periods of poor oral hygiene, frequent consumption of high calorie, carbonated beverages and tooth grinding and clenching."<ref name="ADA"></ref> Similar, though far less severe symptoms have been reported in clinical use of other amphetamines, where effects are not exacerbated by a lack of oral hygiene for extended periods.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=15460293&query_hl=5&itool=pubmed_docsum Relationship between amphetamine ingestion and gingival enlargement]</ref>

Like other substances which stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, methamphetamine causes decreased production of acid-fighting saliva and increased thirst, resulting in increased risk for tooth decay, especially when thirst is quenched by high-sugar drinks.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=12271905 Shaner JW, Caries associated with methamphetamine abuse]</ref>

====Hygiene====
Serious health and appearance problems are caused by unsterilized needles, lack of hygiene, and especially pollutants in street-grade methamphetamine. The use of methamphetamine may lead to hypertension, damage to heart valves, vastly deteriorated dental health, and increased risk of strokes.<ref>*Richards, J.R., Brofeldt, B.T. ''Patterns of tooth wear associated with methamphetamine use''. J Periodontol. 2000 Aug; 71(8):1371–4.</ref> Obsessive skin-picking by chronic methamphetamine users may lead to abscesses.<ref name="pmid17990840"></ref>

====Sexual behaviour====
Users may exhibit sexually compulsive behaviour while under the influence.  This disregard for the potential dangers of unprotected sex or other reckless sexual behavior may contribute to the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

'''Methamfetamine''' ('meth') is een amfetamine. Het heeft een extra methylgroep en werkt sterker dan "gewone" amfetamine.
Methamfetamine werkt op het centrale zenuwstelsel. De gebruiker voelt zich tijdelijk onvermoeibaar en euforisch. Nadat de meth is uitgewerkt volgt een ''crash'': de gebruiker voelt zich neerslachtig en moe.

Methamfetamine is verkrijgbaar in poeder-, kristal- en basevorm.
In het illegale circuit wordt methamfetamine meestal in de hydrochloride zout-vorm verkocht.

Er zijn verschillende medische toepassingen voor dit middel. Voorbeelden van gebruik zijn atleten, studenten of (straaljager)piloten die onder grote druk toch goed willen of moeten presteren. In de Tweede Wereldoorlog gebruikten beide zijden het middel. Ook in de recente conflicten in het Midden-Oosten wordt meth gebruikt door soldaten.
Methamfetamine wordt ook gebruikt als vermageringsmiddel (omdat interesse in eten verloren gaat). Ook bij extreme vormen van ADHD en ADD wordt het gebruikt. Een merknaam voor methamfetamine is desoxyn.

Methamfetamine kan in hoge doseringen hersenschade veroorzaken, maar onduidelijk is nog of het in lage doseringen (zoals wanneer het toegepast wordt als medicijn) schade toebrengt.
Negatieve effecten van gebruik komen vooral voort uit het gebrek aan slaap, zoals geïrriteerd zijn, paranoia, slecht zien en waanbeelden. In heel extreme gevallen kan het ook de dood veroorzaken. 

Methamfetamine kan zeer verslavend werken op sommige mensen. Een gebruiker kan ook in een vicieuze cirkel raken als hij zijn vermoeidheid door gebruik van methamfetamine probeert op te vangen.
