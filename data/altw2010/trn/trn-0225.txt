==Book Series Background==

Blair Cornelia Waldorf, born November 17, was born to high society on Manhattan's exclusive Upper East Side. Her father is Harold Waldorf, Esquire, a married man and successful lawyer, and her mother is Eleanor Waldorf Rose, an Upper East Side hostess. She has a younger sibling named Tyler Waldorf. After her mother's marriage to Cyrus Rose, she gained a step sibling named Aaron Rose, an alternative vegan, and a half-sister, Yale Rose. After Blair's
father ran off with a man to Nate Archibald. She is described to be 5'4" and slender, with brilliant blue eyes, long brunette hair (for the first four books), and a fox-like face. Her two allies, after former best friend Serena left for her New Hampshire boarding school, are Kati Farkas and Isabel Coates. She cuts her long brunette hair to her ears and continues to cut it to look like her idol, Audrey Hepburn.

Blair's a student at the Constance Billard School for Girls, a small, elite, all-girls
school located at 93rd and East Hampton summer home, and the Yale Club of New York City. 

===Overview===

Starting at a dinner party at the Waldorf Penthouse for future stepfather Cyrus Rose, 
former best friend Serena van der Woodsen, described as the most gorgeous girl in all of New York City, returns from her boarding school Hanover Academy in Hanover, New Hampshire. Blair, from the start, doesn't want to give up her spotlight as being the "most happening" girl in the room just yet. She and boyfriend Nate who have dated for about a year are in the middle of a passionate scene when Serena shows up, and entertains all the guests with stories about her wild summer adventures and what it was like to be at boarding school, shunning Blair out of the spotlight again.

Blair starts nasty rumors about Serena and turns her into a school outcast. Eventually, 
Blair finds out boyfriend Nate Archibald slept with Serena right after sophomore year, hence why Serena felt the need to escape to boarding school and not come back for a year before she was kicked out for returning late in the beginning of the school year. When Jenny Humphrey, a freshman with a hearty bosom steals Nate away from her on her birthday, which is also the day that her then pregnant mother marries Cyrus Rose, Serena and Blair make up once again and go back to being the best of friends, while ignoring Nate and his new girlfriend. When Blair's mom marries Cyrus Rose, she meets her new step brother, Aaron Rose (a vegan with an endless supply of herbal cigarettes and an unrequited crush on Blair), comes the day Blair has been waiting for all her life- her Yale interview. 

Blair messes up her college interview at Yale by telling her interviewer about the trainwreck her life has become, and then kissing him on the cheek upon dismissal. Blair's father donates a multi-million dollar vineyard to Yale, but it is still not enough to clear her mistakes, and she is wait-listed at Yale. 
She's turned down by Harvard, Princeton, Brown, Tufts, and Wesleyan and is only accepted into 
Georgetown University, her safety, despite being one of the best girls in the senior class. 
However, Serena, a below-average student, was accepted into all of these schools.

She is known to move out of her home frequently, first trying to live at Serena's penthouse before they left for Sun Valley, then taking a suite at The Plaza Hotel (to the chagrin of Constance Billard's headmistress), moving into Brooklyn with her shaven-haired classmate Vanessa Abrams, living with Serena at the original apartment where Breakfast at Tiffany's was shot, and moving into designer Bailey Winter's East Hampton home as a muse. She also lived in the Yale Club of New York City for a short time, where she held her high school graduation bash. 

After Nate, her relationships with other men have been quite rocky. She started a brief fling with her Yale alumni interviewer, only to end it when she finds out that he was married and has a daughter also studying at Constance. She also had a thing with Serena Van der Woodsen's older brother, Erik Van der Woodsen, while they were skiing at Sun Valley for spring break. After another messy break-up with Nate, she starts a brief affair with a British lord she met at the Yale Club, however, this was ended upon learning of his relationship with his second-cousin. 

Blair is eventually accepted into Yale. She and Nate go on a month-long boat trip around 
the world over the summer and return a week before college starts, only to discover Serena waiting. At the end of the final book, Blair and Serena kiss and make up for good, and Nate leaves them both to sail across the world with his father's Navy mentor, Captain Chips White, to figure his life out, not wanting to choose between either girl or getting in the way of their friendship again.

Blair, infuriated, ends her friendship with Serena. However, at the end of the episode '''Poison Ivy''', the two reconcile as Blair incorrectly stated that Serena had a drug problem (pictures, which Chuck Bass took, implied that Serena was a patient at the Ostroff Centre), when in fact Serena was there to visit her brother who tried to commit suicide. Nate continually seeks out Serena, and in the process breaks Blair's heart on numerous occasions; but Blair, hanging onto him, manages to keep their relationship together until '''Victor/Victrola'''. 

Blair and her fashion designer mother have a rocky relationship. Blair is convinced that Eleanor enjoys Serena's company more than her own and seems more convinced of this when Eleanor chooses Serena over Blair as a model for her clothing line. Her father left her and her mother for a man, Roman, and the two live in France. She is close to her father and is trying to have a closer relationship to her mother. It is also revealed that she has an eating disorder that she has overcome, but sometimes relapses back into when extremely distressed.

Fed up with Nate's attraction to Serena, Blair reaches her breaking point when Nate can't seem to reciprocate her love. She breaks it off with Nate and goes to Victrola, the Chuck Bass has recently purchased. After being challenged by Chuck to dance on stage, she loses her virginity to him in a limo in the spirit of the moment.

Regretful of her actions, Blair is focused on getting back together with Nate as soon as possible and warns Chuck to keep quiet about their affair. On the night of her birthday, however, Nate fails to make an appearance at her party, and Chuck confesses his feelings for her. He gives her a necklace as a birthday present that she had hoped Nate would get for her, and the two begin a secret affair.

She agrees to go to the Constance Billard's debutante ball with Nate, but she is distant, and in a fit of jealousy, Nate gets into a fight over her and is kicked out of the ball. Blair realizes that Chuck tricked Nate into getting into the fight and leaves Chuck to reconcile with Nate. Out of fear of losing Blair to Nate, Chuck attempts to manipulate events in his favor, but his plan back-fires and brings the two together again.
