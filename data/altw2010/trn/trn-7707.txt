'''Bro'Sis''' were a multicultural Popstars''. Originally a sextet, the group eventually became a quintet, selling more than 2,2 million albums and singles worldwide. In early 2006 the band announced that they will no longer be performing together, instead pursuing individual careers in music, theatre, television and film.

==History==
===Formation===
In summer 2001 the German version of ''Detlef "D!" Soost, producer Alex Christensen, and singer and radio host Noah Sow. Over the course of several recalls and re-recalls the three judges and vocal coach Artemis Gounaki reduced the contestants to a group of 32 who immediately travelled to Ibiza, Spain to get trained in singing, dancing, and fitness. In the end three females and five males remained who again moved into a loft in Munich to start working on their performance and publicity skills. 

During a special episode on November 11, 2001, judges Soost and Christensen eventually disclosed that Ross Antony, Hila Bronstein, Shaham Joyce, Faiz-Kevin Mangat, Verena "Indira" Weis, and Giovanni Zarrella were chosen to become part of the multicultural group ''Bro'Sis''.

===Debut: ''Never Forget''===

On German singles chart, eventually selling more than a million copies, it also reached number 4 on the Europe Official Top 100. 2004 taiwanse singer Show Luo covered the single "I Believe" and it is called "戀愛達人/Lian Ai Da Ren".

In January 2002, the band released their debut album, ''double A-single "Do You/Peace of Soul" (February 2001), and "Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel" (June 2001). In the meantime Bro'Sis finished a short club tour and appeared as a supporting act on O-Town's blitz tour. 

After touring once again through Germany, Austria, and Switzerland in summer 2002, a ''Special Winter Edition'' of the album was released in November of the same year. The re-issue included the band's fourth single "Hot Temptation", and charity song "The Gift", a cover version of the same-titled 98 Degrees single. However, the Christmas single became the band's first commercial failure when it reached a moderately successful number 16 on the singles chart, and furthermore peaked outside the Swiss Top 100.

===''Days of Our Lives''===

After months of recording  Bro'Sis released "Oh No/Never Stop", the double A-lead single off of their second studio album, in April 2002. The single spawned two videos, with Latin influenced Hip-Hop song "Oh No" being shot in Spain, and German Football Association anthem "Never Stop" being in filmed in a Berlin stadium. Nevertheless the single failed to chart or sell noticeably in Austria, and Switzerland - although it was an airplay success, and became the band's fifth top ten hit in Germany.

On May 9, 2003, four days before the band's second album's release, Indira Weiß announced her departure from the group. Official statements claimed that musical differences between her and the rest of the band had been reason enough for leaving. However, rumours persisted that she had fallen out with her bandmates.
