'''''Ace in the Hole''''' is a 1951 American auteur Sunset Boulevard'', among others; and his first film to be a critical and commercial failure <ref>''On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder'' by Ed Sikov, Hyperion, New York, New York, 1998, pp. 325-326, ISBN 0-7868-6194-0</ref>. 

The film is a cynical examination of the seedy relationship between the media and the news it reports and the manner in which it reports it. Without consulting Wilder, Paramount Pictures executive Y. Frank Freeman changed the title to ''The Big Carnival'' just prior to its release. Early television broadcasts retained that title, but when aired by Turner Classic Movies - and released on DVD by The Criterion Collection in July 2007 - it reverted to ''Ace in the Hole''.

==Plot==
Chuck Tatum is a fiercely ambitious, self-centered, wisecracking, down-on-his-luck reporter who worked his way west to New Mexico from New York City, along the way being fired from eleven newspapers for slander, adultery, and heavy drinking, among other charges. Although for the past year he's been writing for the ''Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin'', a paper of little consequence, he remains unhumbled.

While unhappily on assignment covering a rattlesnake hunt, he learns about Leo Minosa, a local man who has become trapped in a cave collapse while trying to excavate ancient Indian artifacts. Sensing a golden opportunity, Tatum manipulates the rescue effort, getting the unscrupulous sheriff to pressure the engineer charged with the rescue into using a much slower method, so that Tatum can prolong his stay on the front pages of newspapers nationwide.

Lorraine, the victim's trashy wife, plots with the reporter, after the struggling Minosa business, a combination trading post/restaurant, experiences a financial windfall, thanks to the influx of tourists anxious to witness the rescue first-hand. Herbie Cook, the newspaper's young photographer, slowly loses his idealism as he envisions himself selling his pictures to ''Look'' or ''Life''.

Slowly, thousands of others flock to the town, and the rescue site literally becomes a carnival, with rides, entertainment, and games of chance. Eventually, the party atmosphere dissolves when tragedy strikes. When Tatum learns that Leo Minosa is fading fast, he belatedly tries to get the engineer to switch back to the quicker procedure, but it is no longer possible. Minosa dies, leaving Tatum guilt-ridden.

==Production notes==
The film's plot was inspired by two real-life events. The first involved W. Floyd Collins, who in 1925 was trapped inside in Louisville newspaper, the ''Courier-Journal'', jumped on the story by dispatching reporter William Burke Miller to the scene.  Miller's enterprising coverage turned the tragic episode into a national event and earned the writer a Pulitzer Prize. Floyd's name is cited in the film as an example of a cave-in victim who becomes a media sensation. The second event took place in April 1949. Three-year-old Kathy Fiscus of San Marino, California fell into an abandoned well and, during a rescue operation that lasted several days, thousands of people arrived to watch the action unfold. In both cases the victims died before they were reached by rescuers.<ref>''On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder'', pp. 312-313</ref>

The film set constructed outside Gallup was the largest non-combat set ever constructed at the time. It measured 235-feet high, 1200-feet wide, and 1600-feet deep and included the ancient cliff dwelling, collapsed cave, roadside stands, parking lots, and the carnival site. More than 1,000 extras and 400 cars were utilized in the crowd scenes. After the film was completed, Paramount charged admission to the set.<ref>''On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder'', pg. 317</ref>

In the original script, Tatum colluded with the local sheriff. Joseph Breen of the Hays Code office strongly objected to the on-screen depiction of a corrupt law enforcement officer and insisted Wilder add dialogue making it clear the man eventually would be made to answer for his actions.<ref>''On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder'', pg. 318</ref>

The film's final cost was $1,821,052, $250,000 of which was paid to Wilder as writer, producer, and director.<ref>''On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder'', pg. 325</ref>

Following the film's release, Wilder was sued for plagiarism by screenwriter Victor Desny, who claimed he had contacted Wilder's secretary Rosella Stewart to propose a film based on the story of Floyd Collins in November 1949. Wilder's attorneys responded that not only did a verbal plot summary not constitute a formal story submission, but the Collins case was of a historical nature and as such was not protected by copyright laws. In December 1953, Judge Stanley Mosk ruled in favor of Wilder and Paramount. Desny appealed, and in August 1956 the California Supreme Court ruled his oral submission had been legitimate. Wilder's attorneys settled, paying Desny $14,350.<ref>''On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder'', pp. 327-328</ref>

Jay Livingston and Ray Evans wrote the song "We're Coming, Leo," performed by a vocalist and band at the carnival.  

A character in the film identifies himself as a salesman for Pacific All-Risk Insurance, a fictitious company that was featured in Wilder's 1944 film ''Double Indemnity''.
