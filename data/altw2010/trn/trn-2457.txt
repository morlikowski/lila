'''Parcelforce''' (offisielt '''Parcelforce Worldwide''') er et heleid datterselskap av britiske postverket. Det ble opprettet i 1986 for å stå for pakkeombæring. Brevombæringen håndteres fortsatt av Royal Mail, mens postkontorene drives av Post Office Ltd.

Parcelforce leverer over hele verden gjennom datterselskapet General Logistic Systems, og er dermed i direkte konkurranse med andre verdensdekkende budselskaper som DHL, FedEx og UPS. 

I Storbritannia har Parcelforce et nav lokalisert i Coventry, med underavdelinger andre steder. Hovedkvarteret ligger rett ved Coventry Airport, og er en av landets største bygninger. 

Selskapet har fått mye kritikk fra kunder som mener at det ikke har et godt nok servicenivå, og har blant annet blitt kalt for «Parcelfarce»<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/consumer/tv_and_radio/watchdog/reports/services/services_20060321.shtml BBC: «Watchdog Report»]</ref><ref>[http://technology.guardian.co.uk/businesssense/story/0,,1956248,00.html Guardian: «Parcel Farce»]</ref>.

'''Parcelforce Worldwide''', part of Royal Mail Group Ltd, is one of the top five express parcel carriers in the UK.

Its international partner network allows it to extend its delivery reach worldwide. Its European delivery partner, also part of Royal Mail Group Ltd, is called '''GLS''', ('''General Logistics Systems''') and delivers more than 1 million parcels a day across 34 countries in Europe.<ref>[http://www.royalmailgroup.com/portal/rmg/content1?catId=23200554&mediaId=23700541 Royal Mail Group website - Our brands]</ref>

Parcelforce Worldwide is a direct competitor of other worldwide delivery brands such as UPS.

Parcelforce Worldwide operates a "hub and spoke" collection and delivery system with 2 hubs based in Coventry, adjacent to the airport. One hub is for UK parcels and the other for International parcels. The UK hub is a highly automated tracking and sorting centre covering 43 acres which can handle up to 40,000 parcels an hour.<ref>[http://www.parcelforce.com/portal/pw/content1?catId=26300677&mediaId=load105055 Parcelforce Worldwide website - Our business]</ref>

== Depot Network ==
thumb|right|Parcelforce Iveco delivery vehicle
Parcelforce Worldwide operates its collection and delivery services via a network of 53 local depots.  These have been strategically located around the UK from Inverness in the north west of Scotland to Exeter in the south west of England.  There are two depots in Wales, one central depot in Northern Ireland (serving Belfast) and two smaller satellite depots.

The largest posters also have the option of a direct feed collection.  In other words, rather than a local depot collecting parcels for sorting, a trailer is left on site, filled up during the course of the working day and then taken directly to Coventry for processing.

==Handling fee for incoming international parcels==

Parcelforce charge the recipient of incoming international parcels a £13.50 "handling fee", even though the cost of delivery has already been fully paid by the sender.<ref name="g">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/post/story/0,11489,875711,00.htmll The Guardian's consumer champion fights your corner ]</ref> In 2003 Postwatch said it would investigate, stating "This smacks of profiteering. Customers should be confident when placing orders that the price is the price, with no hidden charges - which in this case appear to be exorbitant. We will be taking this up with Parcelforce immediately."<ref name="g"/> As of 2008 this fee is still in place. The fee is regarded by some customers as a potentially illegal scam.<ref>http://www.volkszone.com/VZi/archive/index.php/t-351900.html Don't Let Parcelforce Steal Your Cash!]]</ref> Commenting on the legality aspect, Postwatch stated in 2008 "there appears to be a case for saying that a postal operator may be acting illegally if it retains an item in order to claim its clearance fee."<ref>http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.html?p=10054717 MoneySavingExpert: Parcelforce 'Clearance fee'</ref>
