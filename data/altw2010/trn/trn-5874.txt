'''Bernd Hölzenbein''' (born World Cup in 1974).  He is best known for being fouled in the final against Netherlands, which led to the Germans' equalising penalty.

A qualified merchant, ''Holz'' debuted for Bundesliga in 1967 to serve for this club until his departure in 1981.  A three times German Cup winner with them in 1974, 1975 and 1981, Holzenbein also won the UEFA Cup with Frankfurt in 1980.  His output of 160 goals in his 420 Bundesliga matches is still club record achievement for Frankfurt.  His departure was due to his unwillingness to accept a pay cut to stay on with Frankfurt and made him become a team-mate of Gerd Müller at Fort Lauderdale Strikers in the United States. Over there he was also playing for Memphis Americans and Baltimore Blast in the Major Indoor Soccer League.  He finished off his career in Germany, playing a handful of games alongside Klaus Toppmöller for FSV Salmrohr before hanging up his boots at ''FC Rhein-Main'' and starting to work as assistant to Horst Heese at Viktoria Aschaffenburg.

In his international career, Hölzenbein scored five goals in those forty caps he won for Germany in between 1973 and 1980, but the foul that lead to the German equaliser in the 1974 FIFA World Cup final against the Netherlands (2-1) remained his moment in time. With the Dutch claiming their defender Wim Jansen had not even touched him when he ended up on the floor inside the Dutch penalty-box, Hölzenbein successfully fought off stories in newspapers in which he apparently confessed diving. 

In 1988 he returned to Bundesliga at the start of the 1990's, mainly because of adding players such as Uwe Bein, Anthony Yeboah and Andreas Möller to the clubs Bundesliga squad.  This trio, together with sweeper Manfred Binz and goalkeeper Uli Stein was the driving force behind Eintracht's title bid in 1991-92, unfortunately missing out on the Bundesliga crown of 1992 due to a bad result on the final day of that season.  This bad result was a turning point in Hölzenbein's career as official and couldn't stop the downfall of Eintracht Frankfurt in the following years. Relegation to the 2nd Bundesliga happened to Frankfurt in 1996 and let Hölzenbein resign a few months later. 
His ongoing involvement in the daily business of Eintracht Frankfurt over those years turned out to be the reason for him to be summoned to court for statements regarding a proposed 'immense tax evasion' of Anthony Yeboah in the players years in German football.

'''Bernd Hölzenbein''' est un allemand né le 9 mars 1946 à Dehrn. Il évoluait au poste d'ailier ou d'attaquant (1m72 - 64kg).

Hölzenbein est particulièrement connu pour avoir disputé la finale de la Pays-Bas lors de la finale 1974, c'est lui qui provoque la faute à l'origine de l'égalisation sur pénalty de son équipe. La RFA battra finalement les Pays-Bas 2 à 1 et s'adjugera la Coupe du monde.

En 1976, il marquera lors de la finale de l'Euro, mais ne pourra pas empêcher la Tchécoslovaquie de remporter le tournoi aux tirs au but.

Pendant une bonne partie de sa carrière professionnelle, de 1967 à 1981, il a joué à l'Eintracht Francfort avec qui il a remporté 3 coupes d'Allemagne en 1974, 1975 et 1981, et une coupe UEFA en 1981. A la fin de la saison 1981, il a rejoint le championnat des Etats-Unis comme d'autres de ses compatriotes avant lui (Gerd Müller et Franz Beckenbauer). Il a joué aux Fort Lauderdale Strikers pendant une saison, aux Memphis Americans à partir de 1983 et aux Baltimore Blast en 1985. Il retournera en Allemagne la même année et rejouera quelques matches au sein du FSV Salmrohr, avant de prendre définitivement sa retraite.
