'''Końskowola''' is a village in southeastern Poland, located between Puławy and Lublin, near Kurów, on the Kurówka River. It is the capital of a separate commune (''gmina'') within Puławy County and the Lublin Voivodeship. Population: 2188 inhabitants (as of 2004).

== Name ==
Końskowola literally translates as ''Horse's Will'', but its name came from ''Wola'' - a type of village, and its owner's name - Jan z Konina (Jan Koniński, John of Konin). The name Konińskawola is noted in 1442.

== History ==
The village was founded probably in the XIV century, under the name Witowska Wola. Its name was later changed to Konińskawola, its present form, in the XIX century.

On June 8, 1532, the town was incorporated. As a private town, Końskowola served as a centre of the foodstuffs trade for the surrounding area. Several textile production factories were also located there. Many people immigrated there from other parts of Poland and elsewhere as well; among others were many immigrants from Saxony.

Since then, it has shared the history of the entire region. After the third partition of Poland, in Kingdom of Poland in 1815. After the January Uprising, in 1870 the town finally lost the city charter, never to regain it. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, many demonstrations and strikes of solidarity were organized there. Since 1918, the town is again part of Poland.

With the onset of the POW camp and camps for slave labour in the town. The POW camp was soon liquidated, but a labour camp continued in operation through 1943. The inmates worked for Germans on farms, and on construction sites of roads and railroads.

A Nazi extermination camp Sobibor. In October 1942, the ghetto' population was liquidated. In a massacre carried out by German troops: the Reserve Police Battalion 101, some 800-1000 Jews, among them women and children, were taken to a nearby forest and slaughtered. The ghetto's remaining inhabitants were transferred to another camp.

With the approach of Red Army forces in the summer of 1944, the Germans had plans to burn the town. On July 25, 1944, the German occupation forces were engaged in battle by fighters of the Polish underground Armia Krajowa, joined by Polish partisans of the Bataliony Chłopskie. With the arrival of Soviet Red Army troops, the combined antifascist combatants succeeded in securing the area's liberation.
