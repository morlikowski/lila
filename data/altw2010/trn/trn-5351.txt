'''Golden Boy''' ist ein Anime und Manga aus dem Bereich Ecchi.

Die Geschichte handelt von einem jungen Mann namens Kintaro Oe, der nach Vollendung seines Jurastudiums mit seinem Mountainbike durch Japan reist, um in ''der Schule des Lebens'' zu lernen.

Dabei nimmt er verschiedene Jobs an, unter anderem in einer Software-Firma, einem Nudel-Restaurant und einem Schwimmbad. In den jeweiligen Betrieben begegnet er immer wieder hübschen Mädchen, zu denen er sich hingezogen fühlt. Diese können ihn jedoch anfangs meist nicht leiden. Doch am Ende einer jeden Folge '''Goldenboy''', vermissen sie ihn doch, wenn er mal wieder beschließt seine sieben Sachen zu packen und mit seinem Mountainbike weiterzureisen.
In der letzten Folge begegnet Kintaro noch einmal allen vorherigen Hauptdarstellerinnen.

Der 1995 produzierte Anime ist an einigen stellen teilweise erotisch aufgebaut und besteht aus sechs Folgen, sogenannten Lektionen. Dennoch werden keine obszönen Szenen geboten und er ist daher ein Ecchi. In Deutschland wurde der humorvolle Anime Anfang 2001 auf MTV ausgestrahlt. Ein Jahr später wurde Golden Boy dann auf DVD veröffentlicht.

Der Anime basiert auf einem Manga von Tatsuya Egawa, der von 1992 bis 1998 zunächst als Fortsetzungsgeschichte im Manga-Magazin ''Super Jump'' bei Shūeisha und dann in zehn Sammelbänden veröffentlicht wurde. Auf Deutsch erschien der Manga bei Carlsen Comics.

 is a collected volume released the following year. Parts of the manga were adapted into a six episode OVA series produced by Shueisha and KSS in 1995, which was subsequently released through ADV Films in North America. ADV's license of the series expired in 2006, however, and in July 2007, Media Blasters acquired the license to it. Media Blasters has confirmed that the dub produced by ADV was kept.

Kintaro, despite having met the requirements for a degree, left Tokyo University without graduating. ''Golden Boy'' depicts his living the life of a free spirit, roaming Japan from town to town, job to job. During his travels, Kintaro meets several women whose lives he dramatically changes, despite poor first impressions. He constantly observes and studies the people and events around him, recording his findings in a notebook he carries on his belt.

The ''Golden Boy'' OVA has been positively received by English-language reviewers, but it is widely known for its mature content: while the OVA is not strictly a hentai animation, it does feature instances of partial female nudity, orgasms, and female masturbation. In contrast, the manga becomes almost pornographic starting in the second volume.<ref></ref> 

== Summary ==
Each volume and episode of ''Golden Boy'' places Kintaro opposite a young, beautiful woman, whose interest or disdain for him acts as the conflict of the plot. Some of these women initially dismiss Kintaro as an idiotic and clumsy pervert, and either give him or accept from him some challenge to prove their superiority. Kintaro invariably lusts after these women, but he is principally driven by his desire to be of actual service to them and to thereby learn more about the world. Despite his outward appearances, Kintaro is an incredibly clever and resourceful individual, and consistently exceeds what the women in his encounters thought possible, winning their hearts despite his outward awkwardness. But due to chance, necessity or a sense of honor, Kintaro never takes advantage of these newfound feelings. 

Much of the humor derives from situational elements, such as encounters between Kintaro and the women gone awry, and interactions between Kintaro's fetish for toilets (especially those recently used by beautiful women), his exaggerated facial expressions, and comical entries in his notebook. The last include explicit drawings of the women he encounters and bits of wisdom such as "'C' is not sex", and "The human head cannot turn 360 degrees." Regarding the series, Tatsuya Egawa writes: "Before leaving kindergarten, I wrote these words in my notebook: 'I really like to study.' Often I wonder when it was that our schools forgot the true meaning of 'study.' Something which is now so often misunderstood by teachers and parents. Learning ought to be both stimulating and entertaining."<ref> (unofficial translation)</ref>
