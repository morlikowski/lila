'''Aerovías de México, S.A. de C.V.''', operating as '''AeroMéxico''', is an USA. Its main base is Mexico City International Airport, with secondary hubs at General Mariano Escobedo International Airport, Monterrey and General Ignacio Pesqueira Garcia International Airport in Hermosillo.<ref name="FI"></ref> '''AeroMéxico''' is the only Latin American airline that flies to Asia, and the only airline in Mexico with scheduled services to Europe. '''Aeromexico''' was one of the founding members of Sky Team. 

The airline together with its feeder Aeroméxico Connect holds the 24.8% of the domestic market share, becoming the Mexican airline with the highest participation on the market. Internationally, Aeroméxico holds the 12.8% of the global market share becoming the second Mexican airline after Mexicana. Aeroméxico and Aeroméxico Connect together operate a total of 650 daily flights to 67 destinations in 3 continents, with a global fleet of 105 airplanes.

== History ==
=== 1934 ===

The airline was established as Aeronaves de México on Stinson SR and Julio Zinser piloted it. He inaugurated the maiden flight on the Mexico City - Acapulco route on 14 September 1934.

When Pan Am, which owned 25% of the new Mexican airline. Aeroméxico saw few changes for the next two decades. However, during the 1950s, renovation began, and the airline took over various small competitor companies across the country, including Aerovias Guest (the second airline of the country at that time) that held the routes to Madrid and Paris. Aeroméxico added aircraft including the legendary Douglas DC-3 and its successor, the Douglas DC-4.

=== 1950s ===

During the late 1950s, the Idlewild Airport (now JFK) using the same Bristol Britannia. The Mexico City-New York route would prove profitable for "Aeronaves" and its North American competitors. The airline was nationalised in 1959.
=== 1960s ===

In the early 1960s fleet of Aeronaves de Mexico (Aeromexico) included Douglas DC-3, Douglas DC-6, and Bristol Britannia aircraft. Starting in 1961, "Aeronaves" began replacing its piston-engined planes with new jets. The first jet-engined aircraft were a pair of Douglas DC-8's. The planes were used on routes within Mexico and to New York City. Between 1962 and 1963, Aeronaves de Mexico (Aeromexico) took over Aerovias Guest Mexico the second airline, and they were merged, under the name Aeronaves de Mexico. Later in the 1960s more DC-8's were added and service to Europe was resumed, the service was operated by two Mexicana's, Comet IVC those planes were dry leased by Aerovias Guest Before the merger.

=== 1970s ===
The 1970s brought dramatic changes for Aeroméxico. In 1970, under a government plan, Mexican domestic airlines were rationalized into an integrated air transport system under the control of Aeronaves de Mexico. The system included eight smaller carriers, although these were later disbanded.<ref name="FI"/>
During the early-1970s, the remaining DC-6 and Bristol Britannia aircraft were retired. A new color scheme (orange and black) was introduced and the airline changed its name from "Aeronaves de México" to its current, shortened version of Aeroméxico in February 1972. Aeromexico, as one of the launch customers of the Douglas DC-10-30s program, received the first two planes in 1974, registered as XA-DUG and XA-DUH. That same year the airline also took delivery the first four Douglas DC-9-32s. During this period the airline's popularity and visibility grew dramatically. This was due in part to Aeroméxico's involvement in Mexican movies. Basically, every time a character in any movie produced in Mexico had to fly somewhere, they supposedly flew on Aeroméxico. Service to Canada was initiated and in late-1970s, two more DC-9-15s were added to the fleet.
=== 1980s ===

The early 1980s brought times of expansion. A new color scheme was introduced (orange paint and silver), two DC-10-15 and a DC-10-30 planes were added in 1981, N10038 and N1003N, and in 1982, N3878P later XA-RIY. Aeromexico as one of the launch customers of the McDonnell Douglas MD-82, a stretch version of the DC-9, received the first two planes in late 1981. During the period between 1980 and 1981, eight more DC-9-32 aircraft were added.     
The late 1980s were tough times for Aeroméxico. On August 31, 1986, the company suffered the only fatal accident outside of Mexico when Aeroméxico Flight 498, a Douglas DC-9, approaching Los Angeles International Airport was struck by a small Piper aircraft. Both aircraft then fell to earth in the Los Angeles suburb of Cerritos, California. All 64 passengers and crew on board the DC-9-32 were killed, as were three on the Piper. Fifteen victims on the ground were also killed. After three years and a long trial, the plane crew and the airline were found not to blame. This was because the pilot of the Piper had strayed into an air traffic control zone reserved for commercial flights. This accident cost 82 people their lives. 
In April 1988, the state owned company was declared bankrupt. The main reasons were lack of organization, a fleet with an average of 20 years without a renovation plan and a depredating administration by the Mexican Government. The company was grounded for three months. In August, a privatization program was underway. This involved retiring ten Douglas DC-8 along with five DC-9-15 aircraft.

=== 1990s ===

The early 1990s were turbulent times, with the rise in fuel costs due to the first Gulf War, and a domestic fare war caused by start up airlines like TAESA, Saro, Aviacsa, among others, as well as constant labor problems. 
In late 1992, Grupo AeroMexico was among other investors that failed to consummate the acquisition of Continental Airlines. Later that year, AeroMexico acquired the bankrupt Aeroperú from the Peruvian government. They tried to use the same path that led AeroMexico to the leadership in the domestic market with AeroPeru. In 1992, AeroMéxico introduced direct flights to Madrid and Paris from Mexico City and started services to Frankfurt via Paris and Rome via Madrid. 
On 1993 Aeromexico Group took over Mexicana the second largest airline in the Mexican market.  
Between 1994 and 1995 the six DC-10 aircraft in the fleet were retired. Their last revenue flight was in February 1995.
The sale of Grupo Cintra was announced after several delays in September 1999. With the looming presidential elections in 2000, everything was delayed once again. The ruling party for 70 years lost the election and all the policies changed. The new government put everything on hold until better economic conditions arrived to start the stock sell-off. Just when they were about to start the process, the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred and nothing materialized since the two main carriers Mexicana and AeroMexico (as all the carriers in the world) were losing large amounts of money.

=== 2000s ===

In the period between 2000-2005 AeroMéxico had an average fleet of 60 aircraft in main line, plus 20 in Boeing 777-200ER. This makes Aeroméxico the fourth airline in Latin America to fly to Asia, after Varig and the now defunct airlines TAESA and VASP. However, because of Varig's current financial situation, Aeroméxico is currently the sole airline with this service until Varig restarts flights to Asia. On June 29, 2006, the International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and AeroMéxico announced that the airline will operate three Boeing 787 airplanes. Aeromexico will lease the three 787-8s from ILFC with deliveries scheduled to begin in early 2010, another two planes on lease from ILFC will be in service by 2011. From 2006, Consorcio AeroMéxico S.A. de C.V., the parent company of AeroMéxico at the time, was facing large debts and couldn't make any profits to pay them off. This forced the company to offer AeroMéxico for sale in 2007. In early october of the same year, a week-long auction was held, with Grupo Financiero Banamex competing against the Saba family. Finally, in October 17, 2007, Banamex had the highest bid, and the airline was sold to the bank for USD$249.1 million.

== Destinations ==

In an attempt to gain more world-wide presence and strenghten its network to make connections easier and more frequent, Aeroméxico has started to develop new international markets, since 2006 when the airline started operations to Tokyo from Mexico City vía Tijuana, several international and long-haul international operations have also started. Few long-haul aircraft have been introduce since, therefore many of the new destinations are not served on a daily basis due to the lack of capable aircraft.
