'''John Lincoln Freund''' - better known as '''John Forsythe''' (born American stage, television and film Dynasty'' (1981–1989). He's also well-known for hosting ''World of Survival'' during the 1970s. Forsythe currently appears each year to read children's fiction during the annual Christmas program near his retirement home at the rural resort community of Solvang, California, north of Los Angeles.

==Early life==
Forsythe, the oldest of three children, was born in Penns Grove, New Jersey to a factory worker,<ref>[http://www.salemcountynj.gov/fedstatelocal/pennsgrove.html Borough of Penns Grove], Salem County, New Jersey. Accessed December 11, 2007.</ref> and was raised in Brooklyn, New York where his father worked as a Wall Street businessman during the Great Depression of 1929.

At only 16 years of age Forsythe graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn and began attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 1936 at age 18, he took a job as the announcer at Ebbets Field Stadium in Brooklyn, New York, confirming a childhood love of baseball.

==Movie career and army service==

Despite showing initial reluctance, Forsythe began an acting career at the suggestion of his father. While there he met actress Parker MacCormick and the two were married in 1939. The couple had a son, Dall (born in 1941), but divorced the following year.

As a bit player for Winged Victory'', then worked with injured soldiers who had developed speech problems. 

Also in 1943, Forsythe met Julie Warren, initially a theatre companion but later a successful actress in her own right, landing a role on Broadway in ''Around the World in 80 Days''. Warren became Forsythe's second wife and in the early 1950s the marriage produced in two daughters - Page and Brooke.

In 1947, Forsythe joined the initial class of the soon-to-be prestigious Mister Roberts'' and ''The Teahouse of the August Moon''.

In 1955, Alfred Hitchcock hired Forsythe to star in the movie ''The Trouble with Harry'', alongside a young Shirley MacLaine. However, this movie didn't fare well at the box office, and Forsythe found high profile movie work increasingly hard to find.

==Television work==
===''Bachelor Father''===
In 1957, Forsythe moved into series television, starring in the Bachelor Father'' for CBS as Bentley Gregg, a playboy lawyer who has to become a father to his niece Kelly (played by Noreen Corcoran), upon the death of her biological parents. The show was an immediate smash hit and moved to NBC a few years later.

On various episodes Forsythe had the pleasure of working with such up-and-coming startlets as ABC but was cancelled that season because of declining ratings.

===Post-''Bachelor Father''===
In the early 1960s, Forsythe made further movies including ''In Cold Blood'' (1967), but made several attempts at developing new television series including: ''The John Forsythe Show'' (1965&ndash;1966) and ''To Rome with Love'' (1969&ndash;1971). However, neither were successful.

Between 1971 and 1977, Forsythe served as narrator on the syndicated nature series, ''The World of Survival''.

===''Charlie's Angels''===
Forsythe's big break came in 1976 (beginning what would be a 13-year relationship with Aaron Spelling), in the role of a mysterious millionaire and private investigator, Charles Townsend, on the ABC crime drama ''Charlie's Angels''. The character of Charlie never appeared on-screen so Forsythe was not required to be on set. Instead, he would record his voice on tape which was presented as a speaker phone conversation in the show, instructing the eponymous Angels of their mission for the episode. His original co-stars on ''Charlie's Angels'' included Farrah Fawcett as Jill Munroe, Jaclyn Smith as Kelly Garrett, and Kate Jackson in the role of Sabrina Duncan, the "smart" angel. 

''Charlie's Angels'' was almost immediately a huge success much as ''Bachelor Father'' had been before, and was exported to over 90 countries. Forsythe quickly became the highest paid actor on television. The show survived the departure in 1977 of its biggest visible star, Farrah Fawcett, who was replaced by Cheryl Ladd after a contract dispute. Ladd, a neighbor and good friend of Forsythe's, was immediately offered the role of Kris Monroe, Jill's younger sister, and remained with the series for the next four seasons. Kate Jackson stayed with ''Charlie's Angels'' for three seasons before leaving in 1979 to participate in other projects. Jaclyn Smith remained on the show until its end.

During this period, Forsythe invested a lot of money in thoroughbred racing, a personal hobby. Gaining respect with the celebrity thoroughbred circuit, he has served on the Board of Directors at the Hollywood Park Racetrack since 1972, and has been on the committee for more than 25 years. 

Following heart problems, Forsythe underwent quadruple ...And Justice for All'' later that year. 

By 1980, ''Charlie's Angels'' was starting to decline in ratings, but Forsythe remained under contract to Spelling.
