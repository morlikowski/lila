'''Odlewnictwo''' – formy ciekłym materiałem (najczęściej stopem metali) oraz takim sterowaniu procesami krzepnięcia i stygnięcia odlewu, aby otrzymać wyrób o odpowiedniej strukturze i właściwościach. Do odlewnictwa zalicza się także techniki przygotowania form odlewniczych (formierstwo) oraz obróbki odlanych obiektów.

W Polsce prace badawczo rozwojowe (B+R) prowadzone są w Instytucie Odlewnictwa w Krakowie ([http://www.iod.krakow.pl]) oraz kilku uczelniach technicznych. Jedyny w Europie Wydział Odlewnictwa Krakowskiego AGH prowadzi studia z zakresu tej branży. Jest to jeden z najtrudniejszych wydziałów na tej uczelni.

Tak naprawdę odlewy są wszędzie wokół nas, służą nam (jako części samochodów, samolotów, statków, maszyn, urządzeń ale także komputerów i jako implanty) i cieszą oko (rzeźby, biżuteria) i ucho (Dzwon Zygmunta). Są małe i precyzyjne (o masie kilku gramów) i olbrzymie, ważące dziesiątki ton (czasami i większe).

<!-- The American spelling for mold is used in this article -->

'''Casting''' is a manufacturing process by which a liquid material is (usually) poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solid casting is then ejected or broken out to complete the process. Casting may be used to form hot liquid metals or various materials that ''cold set'' after mixing of components (such as epoxies, concrete, plaster and clay). Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods.

Casting is a 6000 year old process.<ref name=mco>.</ref> The oldest surviving casting is a copper frog from 3200 BC.<ref name=mco/> 

The casting process is subdivided into two distinct subgroups: expendable and non-expendable mold casting.

==Expendable mold casting==

Expendable mold casting is a generic classification that includes sand, plastic, shell, plaster, and investment (lost-wax technique) moldings. This method of mold casting involves the use of temporary, non-reusable molds.

===Waste molding of plaster===
A durable plaster intermediate is often used as a stage toward the production of a bronze sculpture or as a pointing guide for the creation of a carved stone. With the completion of a plaster, the work is more durable (if stored indoors) than a clay original which must be kept moist to avoid cracking. With the low cost plaster at hand, the expensive work of bronze casting or stone carving may be deferred until a prosperous patron is found, and as such work is considered to be a technical, rather than artistic process, it may even be deferred beyond the lifetime of the artist.

In waste molding a simple and thin plaster mold, reinforced by sisal or burlap, is cast over the original clay mixture. When cured, it is then removed from the damp clay, incidentally destroying the fine details in undercuts present in the clay, but which are now captured in the mold. The mold may then at any later time (but only once) be used to cast a plaster positive image, identical to the original clay. The surface of this "''plaster''" may be further refined and may be painted and waxed to resemble a finished bronze casting.

===Sand casting===

Sand casting is one of the most popular and simplest types of casting that has been used for centuries. Sand casting allows for smaller batches to be made compared to permanent mold casting and at a very reasonable cost. Not only does this method allow manufacturers to create products at a low cost, but there are other benefits to sand casting, such as very small size operations. From castings that fit in the palm of your hand to train beds (one casting can create the entire bed for one rail car), it can all be done with sand casting. Sand casting also allows most metals to be cast depending on the type of sand used for the molds.<ref>'''Technology to Metal Casting''' produced by the American Foundry Society, chapters 2-4</ref>

Sand casting requires a lead time of days for production at high output rates (1-20 pieces/hr-mold) and is unsurpassed for large-part production. Green (moist) sand has almost no part weight limit, whereas dry sand has a practical part mass limit of 2300-2700 kg. Minimum part weight ranges from 0.075-0.1 kg. The sand is bonded together using clays (as in green sand) or chemical binders, or polymerized oils (such as motor oil). Sand can be recycled many times in most operations and requires little additional input.

===Plaster casting (of metals)===
Plaster casting is similar to sand molding except that plaster is substituted for sand. Plaster compound is actually composed of 70-80% gypsum and 20-30% strengthener and water. Generally, the form takes less than a week to prepare, after which a production rate of 1-10 units/hr-mold is achieved, with items as massive as 45 kg and as small as 30 g with very high surface resolution and fine tolerances.  Parts that are typically made by plaster casting are lock components, gears, valves, fittings, tooling, and ornaments.<ref name=met></ref>  Plaster casting is an inexpensive alternative to other molding processes due to the low cost of the plaster and the mold production.  It may be disadvantageous, however, because the mold quality is dependent on several factors, "including consistency of the plaster molding composition, mold pouring procedures, and plaster curing techniques."<ref></ref>  If these factors are not closely monitored, the mold can result in distorted dimensions, shrinking upon drying and poor mold surfaces.

Once used and cracked away, normal plaster cannot easily be recast. Plaster casting is normally used for non-ferrous metals such as aluminium-, zinc-, or copper-based alloys. It cannot be used to cast ferrous material because sulfur in gypsum slowly reacts with iron. The plaster itself cannot stand temperatures above 1200<sup>o</sup>C, which also limits the materials to be cast in plaster.  Prior to mold preparation the pattern is sprayed with a thin film of parting compound to prevent the mold from sticking to the pattern. The unit is shaken, so plaster fills the small cavities around the pattern.  The plaster sets, usually in about 15 minutes, and the pattern is removed.  The plaster is dried at temperatures between 120<sup>o</sup> and 260<sup>o</sup>C.  The mold is preheated and the molten metal poured in. <ref name=met/>

Plaster casting represents a step up in sophistication and requires skill. The automatic functions are easily handed over to robots, yet the higher-precision pattern designs required demand even higher levels of direct human assistance.

===Casting of plaster, concrete, or plastic resin===

Plaster itself may be cast, as can other chemical setting materials such as concrete or plastic resin - either using single-use ''waste'' molds as noted above or multiple-use ''piece'' molds, or molds made of small ridged pieces or of flexible material such as latex rubber (which is in turn supported by an exterior mold).  When casting plaster or concrete, the finished product is, unlike marble, relatively unattractive, lacking in transparency, and so it is usually painted, often in ways that give the appearance of metal or stone. Alternatively, the first layers cast may contain colored sand so as to give an appearance of stone. By casting concrete, rather than plaster, it is possible to create sculptures, fountains, or seating for outdoor use. A simulation of high-quality marble may be made using certain chemically-set plastic resins (for example epoxy or polyester) with powdered stone added for coloration, often with multiple colors worked in. The latter is a common means of making attractive washstands, washstand tops and shower stalls, with the skilled working of multiple colors resulting in simulated staining patterns as is often found in natural marble or travertine.

===Shell molding===
Shell molding is also similar to sand molding except that a mixture of sand and 3-6% resin holds the grains together. Shell molding also uses sand with a much smaller grain than green-sand.  Set-up and production of shell mold patterns takes weeks, after which an output of 5-50 pieces/hr-mold is attainable. Aluminium and magnesium products average about 13.5 kg as a normal limit, but it is possible to cast items in the 45-90 kg range. Shell mold walling varies from 3-10 mm thick, depending on the forming time of the resin.

Shell molding is used for small parts that require high precision.  Some examples include gear housings, cylinder heads and connecting rods.  It is also used to make high-precision molding cores.  This process makes it so complex parts can be cast with less labor.

There are a dozen different stages in shell mold processing that include:

#Initially preparing a metal-matched plate
#Mixing resin and sand
#Heating pattern, usually to between 505-550 K
#Inverting the pattern (the sand is at one end of a box and the pattern at the other, and the box is inverted for a time determined by the desired thickness of the mill)
#Curing shell and baking it
#Removing investment
#Inserting cores
#Repeating for other half
#Assembling mold
#Pouring mold
#Removing casting
#Cleaning and trimming.

The sand-resin mix can be recycled by burning off the resin at high temperatures.

===Investment casting===

Investment casting (known as lost-wax casting in art) is a process that has been practised for thousands of years, with the lost-wax process being one of the oldest known metal forming techniques. From 5000 years ago, when bees wax formed the pattern, to today’s high technology waxes, refractory materials and specialist alloys, the castings, ensure high-quality components are produced with the key benefits of accuracy, repeatability, versatility and integrity.

Investment casting derives its name from the fact that the pattern is invested, or surrounded, with a refractory material.  The wax patterns require extreme care for they are not strong enough to withstand forces encountered during the mold making. One advantage of investment casting it that the wax can be reused.<ref>Kalpakjian, Serope and Steven R. Schmid.  ''Manufacturing Engineering And Technology Fifth Edition''.  Upper Saddle River:  Pearson Education, Inc., 2006.</ref>

The process is suitable for repeatable production of net shape components, from a variety of different metals and high performance alloys. Although generally used for small castings, this process has been used to produce complete aircraft door frames, with steel castings of up to 300 kg and aluminium castings of up to 30 kg. Compared to other casting processes such as die casting or sand casting, it can be an expensive process, however the components that can be produced using investment casting can incorporate intricate contours, and in most cases the components are cast near net shape, so requiring little or no rework once cast.

==Non-expendable mold casting==

thumb|200px|[[Tin soldiers being cast in German molds from the early 20th century. The two mold halves are clamped together, and the metal (an alloy of tin and lead, heated to approx. 300 °C) is poured into the mold. When the metal has solidified, the mold is cracked open. Sprues (pouring channels) and extraneous flash (metal that has penetrated cracks and air channels in the mold) are seen in the third image, and have been removed from the castings in the last image.]]

Non-expendable mold casting differs from expendable processes in that the mold need not be reformed after each production cycle. This technique includes at least four different methods: permanent, die, centrifugal, and continuous casting.
