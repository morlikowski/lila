For his fourth feature, Malick considered directing a biopic about John Smith and transcendental Malickian style. The film was scheduled for limited release on December 25 2005, and for general release in mid-January 2006; it was nominated for an Academy Award and received largely mixed reviews during its theatrical run. Over one million feet of film was shot during the isolated filming schedule, resulting in a final film which ran for 150 minutes before Malick decided to temporarily withdraw the film from release and re-edit it into a 135-minute version.  It has since been announced that a 172-minute version, closer to Malick's intended vision, will be released later this year on DVD by New Line Cinema.

Malick is also credited with the screenplay for ''Great Balls of Fire!'' (1989) and ''Dirty Harry'' (1971).
