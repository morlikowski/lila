 is a Japanese tokusatsu kaiju film. It was released in 1973, and is the 13th Godzilla film.  It was directed by Jun Fukuda, with special effects by Teruyoshi Nakano. 

==Plot summary==

In the film, the undersea civilization Seatopia has been heavily affected by nuclear testing conducted by the surface nations of the world. Naturally upset by this, they unleash their civilization's god, Megalon, to the surface to destroy those who would—unknowingly or not—destroy them. Agents of Seatopia attempt to steal the newly-constructed human-sized robot Jet Jaguar, which they use to guide and direct Megalon. They also capture the robot's inventor, Goro Ibuki, his kid brother Rokuro and their friend Hiroshi Jinkawa. After Jet Jaguar is used by the Seatopians to lure Megalon to Tokyo and the JSDF fails to defeat it, Goro manages to regain control, and sends Jet Jaguar to Monster Island to bring Godzilla to fight Megalon. An extended fight scene then takes place, with Godzilla and Jet Jaguar, the latter newly giant-sized and self-directed, fighting Megalon and Gigan in the hills outside Tokyo. The film ends with Megalon and Gigan (who for the second time abandons an ally) defeated, Godzilla returning to Monster Island, and Jet Jaguar returning to his previous, human-sized state.

==Production==

''Godzilla Vs. Megalon'' was originally planned as a non-Godzilla film, a solo vehicle for Jet Jaguar, which was the result of a contest Toho had for children in mid-to-late 1972 (in an effort to capitalize on the many tokusatsu and anime superhero and super robot shows that were all the rage at the time). The winner of the contest was an elementary school student, who submitted the drawing of a robot called ''Red Arone'', which superficially resembled both Ultraman and Mazinger Z (both of which were very popular at the time). The robot was renamed "Jet Jaguar" and was set to star in a film vehicle for him, titled ''Jet Jaguar vs. Megalon'', which pitted him against Megalon (a previously unused Godzilla monster design). However, after doing some screen tests and storyboards, Toho figured Jet Jaguar would not be able to carry the film on his own, either in screen appearance or marketing value (both important to Toho), so they shut the project down during pre-production. Nearly a month later, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka called in screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa to revise the script to add Godzilla and Gigan (especially since Godzilla had more marquee value).  To make up for lost production time, the film was shot in a hasty three weeks.  The production time totaled at nearly six months, from planning to finish.

==Critical reaction==

''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' was released theatrically in America on May 9, 1976, though the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' indicates that it opened there in June, and ''The New York Times'' indicates that it opened in New York City on July 11. Oddly, ''New York Times'' film critic, Vincent Canby, who a decade before had given a negative review to ''Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster''-- one of the more respected entries in the Godzilla series-- gave ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' a generally positive review. 

In his review of July 12, 1976, Canby says "'Godzilla vs. Megalon' completes the canonization of Godzilla... It's been a remarkable transformation of character-- the dragon has become St. George... It's wildly preposterous, imaginative and funny (often intentionally). It demonstrates the rewards of friendship, between humans as well as monsters, and it is gentle."

''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' was given a high-profile prime-time network premiere the next year, with an introduction and bumper segments by John Belushi in a Godzilla suit. <ref name="Binion"></ref>  
    
''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' has attracted the ire of many Godzilla and kaiju fans in the decades since its original release. The film is largely responsible for the reputation of Godzilla films in the United States as cheap children's entertainment that should not be taken seriously. <ref name="Toho Kingdom"></ref><ref name="Stomp Tokyo"></ref> It's been described as "incredibly, undeniably, mind-numbingly bad"<ref name="Barry"></ref> and one of the "poorer moments" in the history of kaiju films. <ref name="Stomp Tokyo"/>

In particular, the special effects of the film have been heavily criticised. One review described the Godzilla costume as appearing to be "crossed with Kermit the Frog" <ref name="Stomp Tokyo"/> and another stated that sneeringly compared it to ''Godzilla vs. Gigan'', stating that it did "everything wrong that Gigan did, and then some". However, most of the criticism is of the lack of actual special effects work, as most of it consists of stock footage from previous films, including ''Godzilla vs. Gigan'' and ''Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster'', and at least one piece of effects work has garnered praise, specifically a scene where Megalon breaks through a dam. <ref name="Toho Kingdom"/>

The other aspects of the film have been similarly skewered. The acting is usually described as flat and generally poor, and as not improving, or sometimes, worsening, the already weak script. <ref name="Toho Kingdom"/> One part of the film, on the other hand, has garnered almost universal praise: Godzilla's final attack on Megalon, a flying kick. It has been called the saving grace of the film <ref name="Barry"/>, and was made famous by the mock exclamations of shock and awe displayed on ''Godzilla vs. Megalon''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s appearance on ''King Kong, which used a similar image for its own poster. <ref name="Toho Kingdom"/> These posters in particular have been greeted with some embarrassment by fans. <ref name="Barry"/>

In the Japanese version, Robert Dunham's voice was dubbed over by voice actor Goro Naya, best known to Japanese audiences as the villainous voice of Shocker in the Kamen Rider TV series.

There are, interestingly, no major female characters in the movie, making this the only Godzilla film without a female lead.

==Trivia==

* According to Teruyoshi Nakano, the Godzilla suit made for this film (called the "Megaro-Goji") was made in a week, the fastest featured Godzilla suit ever made to date.
* ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' was referenced during the ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' episode "...Or Just Like One."
* While fighting Megalon, Godzilla can be seen doing the Muhammad Ali Shuffle.
* In the audio book for the Daily Show's "America : A Citizen's Guide to Inaction", John Stewart discusses Godzilla vs. Megalon as a US Supreme Court case, finding in favor of Megalon, deciding that the "emission of lighting from its horn-like appendage did not constitute a violation of Godzilla's civil rights"
* There are two notable deleted scenes: A scene towards the end of the film in which Antonio ponders aloud if sending Megalon to destroy the world above is really any different from what the people above are doing with atomic testing. Another is a roughly minute-long "conversation" between Gigan and Megalon that consists of quirky jestures and bodily movements. If kept in, this small scene would've given the villains considerably more character.

In 1976, CinemaShares released a dubbed version of ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' theatrically.  Riding the coattails of Dino De Laurentiis' big-budget ''King Kong'', poster art showed Godzilla and Megalon battling on top of the World Trade Center, despite the fact that no scenes were set in New York City.

To obtain a G-rating from the MPAA, CinemaShares cut three minutes of footage, including:

== Achtergrond ==
===Productie===
''Godzilla Vs. Megalon'' was oorspronkelijk niet gepland als een Godzillafilm, maar als een film om Jet Jaguar te introduceren. Jet Jaguar was het resultaat van een wedstrijd die Toho had georganiseerd voor kinderen eind 1972. Anime superhelden en superrobots waren toen een rage in Japan, en Toho hoopte met Jet Jaguar mee te liften op dit succes. Het winnende ontwerp werd ingestuurd door een basisschoolleerling.

Na een paar testen concludeerde Toho dat een film met enkel Jet Jaguar als de held waarschijnlijk niet aan zou slaan. Derhalve werd het filmproject een tijd stilgelegd. Bijna een maand later kregen producer Tomoyuki Tanaka en scriptschrijver Shinichi Sekizawa het script voor de film in handen, en herschreven het tot een Godzillafilm met Jet Jaguar in een bijrol. Om de verloren tijd in te halen werd de film in amper drie weken opgenomen.

=== Reacties ===
''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' werd ook in Amerika uitgebracht in de bioscopen op 9 mei 1976. De film kreeg wisselende reacties. De  ''New York Times'' filmcriticus Vincent Canby, die eerder de film ''Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster'' had afgekraakt, gaf de film een positieve recensie. 

Toch was niet iedereen het daarmee eens. De film wordt door veel Kaijufans en Godzillafans gezien als de voornaamste reden dat in de Verenigde Staten de oude Godzillafilms vaak af worden gedaan als “goedkope kinderfilms die niet serieus genomen moeten worden”. <ref name="Toho Kingdom">[http://www.tohokingdom.com/web_pages/m_reviews/anthony_r/godzilla_vs_megalon.htm Toho Kingdom; Godzilla vs. Megalon review]</ref><ref name="Stomp Tokyo">[http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/g/godzilla-vs-megalon.html Stomp Tokyo- Godzilla vs. Megalon review]</ref> Vooral de special effects van de film kregen het zwaar te verduren in de recensies. Tevens vonden veel critici het acteerwerk onder de maat.<ref name="Toho Kingdom"/>
