'''Friedrich Heinrich Alexander, Barão de Humboldt''' (alemão, e o irmão mais jovem do ministro e lingüista prussiano Wilhelm von Humboldt.

Alexander von Humboldt foi um naturalista de uma polivalência que, desde sua morte, nunca mais se observou e, haja vista como a ciência se desenvolveu e especializou, certamente não mais será vista. Ele desenvolveu (e se especializou em) diversas áreas: foi etnógrafo, antropólogo, físico, geógrafo, geólogo, mineralogista, botânico, vulcanólogo e humanista, tendo lançado as bases de ciências como a Geografia, Geologia, Climatologia e Oceanografia. Apesar de ter pesquisado diversas coisas em seus mínimos detalhes, sempre o fez com uma visão geral e imparcial.

Com catorze anos de idade, fixou-se em Ciências Naturais.

Em Capitão Cook em sua viagem ao redor do mundo. O resultado de toda essa exploração científica foi uma obra intitulada ''Observações Sobre os Basaltos do Reno''.

Sua viagem exploratória pela América Central e América do Sul (1799-1804) e pela Ásia Central (1829) tornaram-no mundialmente conhecido ainda antes da sua morte. Sua principal obra é o ''Kosmos'', uma condensação do conhecimento científico de sua época. Sua obra ''Ansichten der Natur'' também foi bastante popular.

Sua correspondência científica com colegas cientistas compõe-se de 35 mil cartas, das quais aproximadamente 12&nbsp;500 estão arquivadas.

Além das ciências naturais, foi também um influente Jacob, Carl Friedrich Gauss e Wilhelm Grimm, August Wilhelm Schlegel, assim como Johann Wolfgang von Goethe e Friedrich Schiller.

=== A Fundação Alexander von Humboldt===
Após sua morte, seus amigos e colegas criaram a alemão) para manter o generoso apoio de Humboldt a jovens cientistas. Apesar de a dotação inicial ter se perdido durante a hiperinflação alemã dos anos vinte, e novamente após a Segunda Guerra Mundial, a fundação tem recebido apoio do governo alemão e tem um papel importante na atração de pesquisadores estrangeiros à Alemanha, possibilitando também a pesquisadores alemães trabalharem no estrangeiro por um determinado período.

==Vida e viagens de Humboldt==
===Juventude e educação===

Com nove anos de idade, após a morte de seu pai, Alexander e seu irmão Wilhelm, dois anos mais velho, são criados pela mãe, Maria Elizabeth von Colomb, no castelo de Tegel, nos arredores de Berlim.

O segundo tutor dos Humboldt, Gottlob Christian Kunth, tem um papel importante na vida de Alexander. Ele transmite aos irmãos Humboldt sólidas bases de História, Matemática e línguas. Alexander demonstra grande interesse pela História natural.

Enquanto Wilhelm demonstra uma robusta constituição, grande facilidade de aprendizagem e se orienta à alta função pública, Alexander aprende com dificuldade, orientando-se para uma formação em Economia, que ele estuda durante seis meses na universidade de Frankfurt (Oder). Um ano mais tarde, em 25 de abril de 1789, ele se matricula na universidade de Göttingen.

Em Göttingen tem aulas de G. C. Lichtenberg, C. G. Heyne e J. C. Blumenbach. Durante suas férias de 1789 ele deu uma demonstração de suas proezas posteriores em uma excursão científica que subiu o Reno, que originou o estudo ''Mineralogische Beobachtungen über einige Basalte am Rhein'' (Brunswick, 1790) (Observações mineralógicas sobre alguns Basaltos do Reno).

Alexander von Humboldt estudou ainda o A. G. Werner, J. C. Loder, F. X. von Zach e J. G. Köhler. Suas pesquisas sobre a vegetação das minas de de Freiberg levaram à publicação, em Galvani, foram condensados no seu ''Versuche über die gereizte Muskel- und Nervenfaser'' (Berlin, 1797), enriquecido de uma tradução francesa com notas de Blumenbach.

===Viagens e trabalhos na Europa===
Em Schiller, ''Die Horen'', uma alegoria filosófica intitulada ''Die Lebenskraft, oder der rhodische Genius''. No verão de Forster. Em 1792 e 1797, esteve em Viena; em 1795, realizou uma viagem a caráter geológico e botânico na Suíça e na Itália. Durante este tempo, obteve um posto público como assessor de Minas em Berlim, em 29 de fevereiro de 1792. 

Diante da ignorância dos mineradores, que não sabem distinguir um mineral de uma rocha sem valor, Humboldt abre uma escola de formação de mineradores, que ele financia com seu próprio dinheiro. Ele recusará o dinheiro que o Ministro von Heinitz lhe enviará para rembolsar suas despesas. Humboldt realiza também pesquisas para melhorar a segurança das minas.

Apesar de o serviço público ser por ele considerado como um aprendizado ao serviço da ciência, ele cumpriu suas tarefas com tanta habilidade e zelo que não somente foi promovido a postos superiores no seu departamento, como também recebeu diversas missões diplomáticas importantes. 

Em 1795, von Heinitz propõe a Humboldt o cobiçado posto de Diretor de Minas da Silésia, no sudeste da Prússia. Humboldt recusa e abandona o serviço público.

A morte de sua mãe, em 19 de novembro de 1796, deixa-o livre para seguir seu destino, no que aguarda uma oportunidade de pôr em prática seus planos de viagem.

===A expedição pela América Latina===

O Pacífico, e depois ao Baudin. Uma guerra com a Áustria leva o Diretório a anular a expedição.

O botanista Napoleão no Egito. O barco que eles deveriam tomar jamais aportou em geográficas.

Humboldt é apresentado ao rei e à rainha da Espanha, obtendo um passaporte com o selo real, que garante aos viajantes a assistência das autoridades que eles encontrarem. Bonpland torna-se oficialmente secretário de Humboldt. Os dois são os primeiros a efetuar uma exploração científica digna deste nome. A ambição de Humboldt durante essa viagem às Américas é ''descobrir a interação das forças da Natureza e as influências que o ambiente geográfico exerce sobre a vida animal''. Com essas poderosas recomendações, eles embarcam no ''Pizarro'' na Corunha em 5 de junho de 1799.

Durante a navegação, Humboldt efetua medidas astronômicas, meteorológicas, de magnetismo, de temperatura e de composição química do mar.

Fazem uma escala de seis dias em escravos, mesmo se é nas possessões espanholas onde eles são mais bem tratados.

Em fevereiro de hidrográficos do Orinoco e do canal Casiquiare, que liga o Orinoco ao Amazonas), e a determinação exata do ponto de bifurcação. Humboldt e Bonpland não são os primeiros europeus a tomar essa rota, mas o rigor dos seus dados e das descrições que realizaram faz com que não existam mais dúvidas sobre a existência de uma passagem navegável entre os dois rios.

Eles recolhem diversos espécimens de animais e plantas desconhecidos, e Humboldt anota meticulosamente a temperatura do rio, do solo e do ar, assim como a enguias elétricas foram capturadas por Alexander von Humboldt (com Aimé Bonpland) por volta de 19 de março de 1800. Os pesquisadores receberam choques elétricos violentos durante suas experiências.

Em Cartagena. 

Humboldt descobre que Baudin deixou a França e deve chegar em Andes, passando doze meses em altitude através dos vulcões. Eles têm os pés em sangue, mas recusam fazer como a aristocracia local: serem transportados em cadeiras fixas nas costas de índios.

Subindo o curso do Magdalena, e atravessando os picos gelados dos Andes, chegam em Quito depois de um dia difícil em 6 de janeiro de 1802. Durante essa estadia, escalaram o Pichincha e o Chimborazo, e terminaram em uma expedição às fontes do Amazonas a caminho de Lima, onde chegam em 22 de outubro de 1802. 

Humboldt ganha um renome mundial ao escalar o Chimborazo, pico considerado na época como o mais alto do mundo.

Em Mercúrio em 9 de novembro, e estuda as propriedades fertilizantes do guano, cuja introdução na Europa muito se deveu às suas obras. Uma viagem tumultuada, sob uma tempestade, levou-os para o México, onde residiram durante 1 ano.

Humboldt e seus companheiros passaram o ano de 1803 a percorrer o México. Humboldt escreverá seu ''Ensaio político sobre o reino da Nova Espanha'', o primeiro ensaio geográfico regional, no qual ele relata sumariamente suas viagens. No México, estuda o calendário azteca.

Ele embarca em seguida para a Havana, a fim de recuperar suas coleções lá depositadas havia mais de 3 anos.

===Passagem pelos Estados Unidos===
Estimando seu dever saudar o presidente Thomas Jefferson, ele prolonga sua viagem e vai para a Filadélfia, até pouco capital do país. Humboldt é acolhido pela Sociedade americana de Filosofia, criada sobre o modelo da Royal Society de Londres. Humboldt passa a maior parte do seu tempo com os membros da sociedade. Bonpland e Montufar, não falando o inglês, têm um papel de figurantes. Humboldt encontra Jefferson, com que discute sobre história natural, costumes diferentes de acordo com o país e as maneiras de melhorar o nível de vida. Os dois homens se entendem tão bem que Jefferson convida Humboldt a morar na casa dele.

Eles zarparam para a Europa na embocadura do Delaware, chegando em Bordeaux em 3 de agosto de 1804.

 (German naturalist and explorer, and the younger brother of the Prussian minister, philosopher, and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835). Humboldt's quantitative work on botanical geography was foundational to the field of biogeography.

Between 1799 and 1804, Humboldt travelled to Latin America, exploring and describing it from a scientific point of view for the first time. His description of the journey was written up and published in an enormous set of volumes over 21 years. He was one of the first to propose that the lands bordering the Atlantic were once joined (South America and Africa in particular). Later, his five-volume work ''Kosmos'' (1845) attempted to unify the various branches of scientific knowledge. Humboldt supported and worked with other scientists, including Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac, Justus von Liebig, Louis Agassiz, Matthew Fontaine Maury, and most notably Aimé Bonpland (with whom he conducted much of his scientific exploration).

==Humboldt's life and travels==
===Early life and education===
Humboldt was born in Berlin in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. His father, Alexander George von Humboldt, was a major in the Prussian Army and belonged to a prominent Pomeranian family and was rewarded for his services during the Seven Years' War with the post of Royal Chamberlain. He married Maria Elizabeth von Colomb in 1766, the widow of Baron von Holwede, and they had two sons.

Alexander's childhood was not promising as regards either health or intellect. His characteristic tastes, however, soon displayed themselves; and from his penchant for collecting and labelling plants, shells, and insects he received the playful title of "the little apothecary". His father died in University of Frankfurt (Oder); and a year later, on Göttingen, then eminent for the lectures of C. G. Heyne and J. F. Blumenbach. His vast and varied powers were by this time fully developed, and during a vacation in 1789, he made a scientific excursion up the Rhine, and produced the treatise ''Mineralogische Beobachtungen über einige Basalte am Rhein'' (Brunswick, 1790).

Humboldt's passion for travel was confirmed by friendships formed at Göttingen with A. G. Werner, anatomy at J. C. Loder, and astronomy and the use of scientific instruments under F. X. von Zach and J. G. Köhler. His researches into the vegetation of the mines of Freiberg led to the publication, in 1793, of his ''Florae Fribergensis Specimen''; and the results of a prolonged course of experiments on the phenomena of muscular irritability, then recently discovered by Luigi Galvani, were contained in his ''Versuche über die gereizte Muskel- und Nervenfaser'' (Berlin, 1797), enriched in the French translation with notes by Blumenbach.

===Travels and work in Europe===
In 1794 Humboldt was admitted to the intimacy of the famous Schiller's new periodical, ''Die Horen'', a philosophical allegory entitled ''Die Lebenskraft, oder der rhodische Genius''. In the summer of 1790 he paid a short visit to England in company with Forster. In 1792 and 1797 he was in Vienna; in 1795 he made a geological and botanical tour through Switzerland and Italy. He had obtained in the meantime official employment: appointed assessor of mines at Berlin, February 29, 1792. Although this service to the state was regarded by him as only an apprenticeship to the service of science, he fulfilled its duties with such conspicuous ability that not only did he rise rapidly to the highest post in his department, but he was also entrusted with several important diplomatic missions. The death of his mother, on 19 November 1796, set him free to follow the bent of his genius, and severing his official connections, he waited for an opportunity to fulfil his long-cherished dream of travel. 

===Latin American expedition===
On the postponement of Captain Baudin's proposed voyage of Napoleon Bonaparte in Egypt. Means of transport, however, were not forthcoming, and the two travellers eventually found their way to Madrid, where the unexpected patronage of the minister Don Mariano Luis de Urquijo convinced them to make Spanish America the scene of their explorations.

Armed with powerful recommendations, they sailed in the ''Pizarro'' from oil-bird, which he was to make known to science as ''Steatornis caripensis''. Returning to Cumaná, Humboldt observed, on the night of 11-12 November, a remarkable a communication between the water-systems of the rivers Orinoco and Amazon, and of determining the exact position of the bifurcation. Around March 19, 1800, von Humboldt and Bonpland discovered and captured some electric eels. They both received potentially dangerous electric shocks during their investigations.

On Magdalena, and crossing the frozen ridges of the Cordillera Real, they reached Pichincha and Chimborazo. Humboldt and his party reached an altitude of 19,286 feet, a world record at the time. The journey concluded with an expedition to the sources of the Amazon ''en route'' for Delaware, and landed at Bordeaux on August 3, 1804.

===Achievements of the Latin American expedition===
right|250px|thumb|An [[1815 self-portrait of Humboldt (age 45).]]
This memorable expedition may be regarded as having laid the foundation of the sciences of physical geography and igneous origin of rocks previously held to be of aqueous formation, he contributed largely to the elimination of erroneous views, such as Neptunism.

The reduction into form and publication of the encyclopædic mass of scientific, political and archaeological material &ndash; collected by him during his absence from Europe &ndash; was now Humboldt's most urgent desire. After a short trip to Italy with Gay-Lussac for the purpose of investigating the law of magnetic declination, and a sojourn of two and a half years in his native city, he finally, in the spring of 1808, settled in Paris with the purpose of securing the scientific cooperation required for bringing his great work through the press. This colossal task, which he at first hoped would occupy but two years, eventually cost him twenty-one, and even then it remained incomplete. In these early years in Paris, he shared accommodation and a laboratory with his former rival, and now friend, Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac, both working together on the analysis of gases and the composition of the atmosphere.

Humboldt is considered to be the be the "second discoverer of Cuba" due to all the scientific and social research he conducted on this Spanish colony. During an initial three month stay at Havana his first tasks were to properly measure Havana city and nearby towns of Guanabacoa, Regla and Bejucal.
He befriended Cuban land owner and thinker Francisco Arrango y Parreño, together they visited the Guines area in south Havana, the valleys of Matanzas Province and the Valley of the Sugar Mills in Trinidad, these three were at the time the first frontier of the sugar production in the island, during these trips Humboldt collected statistical information on Cuba's population, production, technology and trade, and with Arrango he made contributions and ideas to enhance them. He predicted that the agricultural and commercial potential of Cuba was huge and could be vastly improved with a proper leadership in the future. After traveling America, Humboldt returned to Cuba for a second shorter stay in April 1804. During this time he conducted among his scientific and landlords friends mineralogical surveys and finished his vast Botanical and Fauna collection on the Island. 

Finally, Humboldt conducted a rudimentary census of the indigenous and European inhabitants in New Spain, and on May 5, 1804, he estimated the population to be six million individuals.<ref> </ref><ref></ref>

===Humboldt acclaimed===
With the exception of congress of Aachen. Again in the autumn of 1822 he accompanied the same monarch to the congress of Verona, proceeded thence with the royal party to Rome and Naples, and returned to Paris in the spring of 1823.

The Encyclopædia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, observes, "Thus that scientific conspiracy of nations which is one of the noblest fruits of modern civilization was by his exertions first successfully organized." However, earlier examples of international scientific cooperation exist, notably the eighteenth-century observations of the Transits of Venus.

===Explorations in Russia===
In 1811, and again in 1818, projects of Asiatic exploration were proposed to Humboldt, first by the Russian government, and afterwards by the Prussian government; but on each occasion, untoward circumstances interposed, and it was not until he had begun his sixtieth year that he resumed his early role of traveller in the interests of science. Between May and November 1829, he, together with his chosen associates, Gustav Rose and C. G. Ehrenberg, traversed the wide expanse of the Russian empire from the Neva to the Yenesei, accomplishing in twenty-five weeks a distance of 9,614 miles. The journey, however, though carried out with all the advantages afforded by the immediate patronage of the Russian government, was too rapid to be profitable. Its most important fruits were crabapples, the correction of the prevalent exaggerated estimate of the height of the Central Asian plateau, and the discovery of diamonds in the gold-washings of the Ural, a result which Humboldt's Brazilian experiences enabled him to predict, and by predicting to secure.

===Humboldt as diplomat===
Between Louis Philippe, with whom he always maintained the most cordial personal relations.

His brother, Wilhelm von Humboldt, died in Alexander's arms on 8 April 1836. The death saddened the later years of his life; Alexander lamented that he had lost half of himself with the death of his brother.

Upon the accession of the crown prince Frederick William IV in June 1840, Humboldt's favour at court increased. Indeed, the new king's craving for Humboldt's company became at times so importunate as to leave him only a few waking hours to work on his writing.

===The "Cosmos"===

thumb|300px|left|Statue of Alexander von Humboldt outside [[Humboldt University, Unter den Linden, Berlin. Note the Spanish inscription describing him as "the second discoverer of Cuba."]]

It is not often that a man postpones until his seventy-sixth year, and then successfully executes, the crowning task of his life. Yet this was Humboldt's case. The first two volumes of the ''Kosmos'' were published, and, in the main, composed, between the years 1845 and 1847. The idea of a work that should convey not only a graphic description, but an imaginative conception of the physical world which should support generalization by details, and dignify details by generalization, had floated before his mind for more than half a century. It first took definite shape in a set of lectures delivered by him before the University of Berlin in the winter of 1827-28. These lectures formed, as his latest biographer expresses it, ''"the cartoon for the great fresco of the Kosmos."'' The scope of this remarkable work may be described briefly as the representation of the unity amidst the complexity of nature. In it, the large and vague ideals of the 18th century are sought to be combined with the exact scientific requirements of the 19th century. And, in spite of inevitable shortcomings, the attempt was in an eminent degree successful. A certain heaviness of style, too, and laborious picturesqueness of treatment make it more imposing than attractive to the general reader. But its supreme and abiding value consists in its faithful reflection of the mind of a great man. No higher eulogy can be passed on Humboldt than that, in attempting, and not unworthily so, to portray the universe, he succeeded still more perfectly in portraying his own comprehensive intelligence.

The last decade of his long life — his "improbable" years, as he was accustomed to calling them — was devoted to the continuation of this work, of which the third and fourth volumes were published in 1850-58, while a fragment of a fifth was to appear posthumously in 1862. In these volumes he sought to elaborate upon the individual branches of science broadly surveyed in the first volume. Notwithstanding their high separate value, it must be admitted that, from an artistic point of view, these additions were deformities. 
The characteristic idea of the work, so far as such a gigantic idea admitted of literary incorporation, was completely developed in its opening portions, and the attempt to convert it into a scientific encyclopædia was in truth to nullify its generating motive. Humboldt's remarkable industry and accuracy were never more conspicuous than in this latest trophy to his genius. Nor did he rely entirely on his own labours. 
He owed much of what he accomplished to his rare power of assimilating thoughts that were not as his own and availing himself of others' cooperation. The notes to Kosmos overflow with laudatory citations, the current coin in which he discharged his intellectual debts.

===Illness and death===
On February 24, 1857 Humboldt suffered a minor stroke, which passed without perceptible symptoms. It was not until the winter of 1858-1859 that his strength began to decline, and that spring, on 6 May, he died quietly in Berlin at the age of 89. The honours which had been showered on him during life continued after his death. His remains, prior to being interred in the family resting-place at Tegel, were conveyed in state through the streets of Berlin, and received by the prince-regent at the door of the cathedral. The first centenary of his birth was celebrated on 14 September, 1869, with great enthusiasm in both the New and Old Worlds. Numerous monuments erected in his honour, and newly explored regions named after Humboldt, bear witness to his wide fame and popularity.

===Personal life===
thumb|250px|Steel engraving of a portrait of Humboldt by [[Julius Schrader]]
Much of Humboldt's private life remains a mystery because he destroyed his private letters. 

In 1908 the sexual researcher Paul Näcke, who worked with Magnus Hirschfeld, gathered reminiscences of him from people who recalled his participation in the homosexual subculture of Berlin.<ref></ref> A travelling companion, the pious Francisco José de Caldas, accused him of frequenting houses where 'impure love reigned', of making friends with 'obscene dissolute youths', and giving vent to 'shameful passions of his heart'.<ref>''Colonialism and Homosexuality'', by Robert F. Aldrich, Routledge, London 2003, p. 29.</ref> 

Throughout his life Humboldt formed strong emotional attachments to men. To the soldier Reinhard von Haeften he wrote: "I know that I live only through you, my good precious Reinhard, and that I can only be happy in your presence."<ref>''The Life and Times of Alexander Von Humboldt'', by Helmut de Terra. Alfred A. Knopf, New York 1955, p. 63.</ref> He never married, yet there were two notable exceptions where he seemed to have been drawn to the opposite sex. The first was an adolescent infatuation with Henriette Herz, the beautiful wife of Marcus Herz, his mentor, and the second was a short lived but intimate relationship with a woman named Pauline Wiesel in 1808 Paris.<ref></ref> He was strongly attached to his brother's family; and in his later years the somewhat arbitrary sway of an old and faithful servant held him in more than matrimonial bondage. By a singular example of generosity (or some people would say weakness), he executed, four years before his death, a deed of gift transferring to this man Seifert the absolute possession of his entire property. No undue advantage appears to have been taken of this extraordinary concession. 

The clue to his inner life might well be found in a certain egotism of self-culture scarcely separable from the promptings of genius. Yet his attachments, once formed, were sincere and lasting. He made innumerable friends; and it does not stand on record that he ever lost one. His benevolence was throughout his life active and disinterested. His early zeal for the improvement of the condition of the miners in Galicia and Franconia, his consistent detestation of slavery, his earnest patronage of rising men of science, bear witness to the large humanity which formed the ground-work of his character. 

The faults of his old age have been brought into undue prominence by the injudicious publication of his letters to Varnhagen von Ense. The chief of these was his habit of smooth speaking, almost amounting to flattery, which formed a painful contrast with the caustic sarcasm of his confidential utterances. His vanity, at all times conspicuous, was tempered by his sense of humour, and was so frankly avowed as to invite sympathy rather than provoke ridicule. After every deduction has been made, he yet stands before us as a colossal figure, not unworthy to take his place beside Goethe as the representative of the scientific side of the culture of his country.
