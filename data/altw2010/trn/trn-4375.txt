The '''Second Sudanese Civil War''' (sometimes referred to as '''a peace agreement in January 2005, yet fighting continues to the present day, and hundreds of thousands remain internally displaced.

==Background and causes==
''For more information, see History of Sudan, 1956-1969, History of Sudan, 1969-1985''

The war is usually characterized as a fight between the southern, non-Arab populations against the northern, Arab-dominated government. Kingdoms and great powers based along the Nile river have fought against the people of inland Sudan for centuries. Since at least the 17th century, central governments have attempted to regulate and exploit the cattle herders of southern and inland Sudan.<ref>Lee J.M.

When the British ran Sudan as a colony they administered the northern and southern provinces separately. The south was held to be more similar to the other east-African colonies &mdash; Arabic-speaking Egypt. Northerners were prevented from holding positions of power in the south, and trade was discouraged between the two areas.

However, in 1946 the British gave in to northern pressure to integrate the two areas. Arabic was made the language of administration in the south, and northerners began to hold positions there. The southern elite, trained in English, resented the change as they were kept out of their own government.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20051227024857/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~sail/insudan.htm What's happening in Sudan?], Sudanese Australian Integrated Learning (SAIL) Program.

In 1955, southern resentment of northern federal system. For the next 17 years, the southern region experienced civil strife, and various southern leaders agitated for regional autonomy or outright secession.

Another factor in the second war was the natural resources of Sudan, particularly in the south, where there are significant oil fields. Oil revenues make up about 70% of Sudan's export earnings. Due to numerous tributaries of the precipitation in southern Sudan, the south also has greater access to water, and is therefore much more fertile. The north of the country is on the edge of the Sahara desert. The northern desire to control these resources, and the southern desire to maintain control of them, contributed to the war. A parallel war between the Nuer and Dinka also raged in the south.

This chronic state of insurgency against the central government was suspended in 1972 after the signing of the Nimeiry declared his intention to transform Sudan into a Muslim Arab state, divided the south into three regions and instituted Shari’a law. This was controversial even among Muslim groups. After questioning Nimeiry's credentials to Islamicize Sudan's society, Ansar leader Sadiq al-Mahdi was placed under house arrest. 

On 26 April 1983, President Nimeiry declared a state of emergency, in part to ensure that Shari’a was applied more broadly. Most constitutionally guaranteed rights were suspended. In the north, emergency courts, later known as "decisive justice courts", were established, with summary jurisdiction over criminal cases. Amputations for theft and public lashings for alcohol possession were common during the state of emergency. Southerners and other non-Muslims living in the north were also subjected to these punishments. These events, and other longstanding grievances, in part led to a resumption of the civil war.

The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) was founded in 1983 as a southern-based mainly non-Arabic rebel group, fighting against the central government and attempting to establish an independent Southern Sudan under its leadership. Its leader was John Garang.

In September 1984, President Nimeiry announced the end of the state of emergency and dismantled the emergency courts but soon promulgated a new judiciary act, which continued many of the practices of the emergency courts. Despite Nimeiry's public assurances that the rights of non-Muslims would be respected, southerners and other non-Muslims remained deeply suspicious.

===Arms Suppliers===

Sudan relied on a variety of countries for its arms supplies. Following independence, the army was trained and supplied by the British. After the 1967 Six-Day War however, relations were cut off, as were relations with the United States and West Germany. 

From 1968 to 1972, the Soviet Union and Eastern bloc nations sold large numbers of weapons and provided technical assistance and training to Sudan. At this time the army grew from a strength of 18,000 to roughly 50,000 men. Large numbers of tanks, aircraft, and artillery were acquired, and they dominated the army until the late 1980s.

Relations cooled between the two sides after the Marxist elements in Ethiopia angered the Sudanese sufficiently to cancel their deals. The People's Republic of China was the main supplier in the late 1970s.

Egypt was the most important military partner in the 1970s, providing missiles, personnel carriers, and other military hardware. At the same time military cooperation between the two countries was important.

Western countries began supplying Sudan again in the mid-1970s. The United States began selling Sudan a great deal of equipment around 1976, hoping to counteract Soviet support of Marxist Ethiopians and US$101 million. After the start of the second civil war, American assistance dropped, and was eventually cancelled in 1987.<ref>[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-13451.html Sudan - Foreign Military Assistance], Library of Congress Country Study ([http://www.country-data.com/frd/cs/sdtoc.html TOC]), research completed June 1991.

Early 1985 saw serious shortages of fuel and bread in Khartoum, a growing insurgency in the south, drought and famine, and an increasingly difficult refugee burden. In early April, during Nimeiry's absence from the country, massive demonstrations, first triggered by price increases on bread and other staples, broke out in Khartoum.

On 6 April, senior military officers led by Gen. Abdul Rahman Suwar ad-Dahhab mounted a coup. Among the first acts of the new government was to suspend the 1983 constitution, rescind the decree declaring Sudan's intent to become an Islamic state, and disband Nimeiry's Sudan Socialist Union. However, the "September laws" instituting Shari’a law were not suspended. A 15-member transitional military council was named, chaired by Gen. Suwar ad-Dahhab. In consultation with an informal conference of political parties, unions, and professional organizations known as the "Gathering", the council appointed an interim civilian cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Dr. Al-Jazuli Daf'allah.

Elections were held in April 1986, and a transitional military council turned over power to a civilian government as promised. The government, headed by Prime Minister Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) (formerly the National Unionist Party, NUP), the National Islamic Front (Hassan al-Turabi’s NIF) and several southern parties. This coalition dissolved and reformed several times over the next few years, with Sadiq al-Mahdi and his Umma party always in a central role.

In May 1986, the Sadiq al-Mahdi government began peace negotiations with the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), led by Col. John Garang. In that year the SPLA and a number of Sudanese political parties met in Ethiopia and agreed to the "Koka Dam" declaration, which called for abolishing Islamic law and convening a constitutional conference. In 1988, the SPLA and the DUP agreed on a peace plan calling for the abolition of military pacts with Egypt and Libya, freezing of Islamic law, an end to the state of emergency, and a cease-fire. A constitutional conference would then be convened.

During this period, the civil war intensified in lethality and the economy continued to deteriorate. When prices of basic goods were increased in 1988, riots ensued, and the price increases were cancelled.  When Sadiq al-Mahdi Rya refused to approve a peace plan reached by the DUP and the SPLA in November 1988, the DUP left the government. The new government consisted essentially of the Umma and the Islamic fundamentalist NIF.

In February 1989, the army presented Sadiq with an ultimatum: he could move toward peace or be thrown out. He formed a new government with the DUP and approved the SPLA/DUP agreement. A constitutional conference was tentatively planned for September 1989. 

On junta of 15 military officers (reduced to 12 in 1991) assisted by a civilian cabinet. General al-Bashir became president and chief of state, prime minister and chief of the armed forces.

The new military government banned trade unions, political parties, and other "non-religious" institutions. 78,000 members of the army, police, and civil administration were purged in order to reshape the government.

In March 1991, a new penal code, the Criminal Act of 1991, instituted harsh punishments nationwide, including amputations and stoning. Although the southern states are officially exempt from these Islamic prohibitions and penalties, the 1991 act provides for a possible future application of Islamic Law (Shari’a) in the south. In 1993, the government transferred all non-Muslim judges from the south to the north, replacing them with Muslim judges. The introduction of Public Order Police to enforce Shari’a law resulted in the arrest and treatment under Shari’a law of southerners and other non-Muslims living in the north.

'''제2차 수단 내전'''은 1983년에 시작되었다. 이 분쟁은 1955년부터 1972년까지 일어난 제1차 수단 내전의 연장선에 있다고 여겨진다. 2차 세계 대전 이후로 비전투원 사망자가 가장 많은 분쟁 중 하나인 이 내전이 일어난 뒤 남부 수단은 20세기 후반의 가장 길고 잔혹한 전쟁의 희생양이 되어 대략 190만 명이 죽고 400만 명 이상이 도피해야 했다. 공식적으로 분쟁은 2005년 1월에 평화 협정에 체결되면서 끝났지만, 여전히 분쟁은 계속되고 있다. 

== 분쟁의 원인과 배경 ==
이 분쟁은 북부의 아랍인이 지배하는 정부에 대한 남부의 비아랍인 주민의 봉기라고 여겨진다. 나일 강 기슭에 기반을 둔 왕국이나 열강은 수 세기 동안 수단 내륙의 주민들과 싸워왔다. 적어도 17세기 이후 중앙 정부는 남부나 내륙의 수단인들을 착취하고 지배하려고 시도했다.

영국이 수단을 식민 지배 할 때는 남북을 분리해서 지배했다. 남부는 케냐, 탄자니아, 우간다 같은 동아프리카와 비슷하게 취급됐고 북부는 아랍의 이집트와 비슷하게 취급됐다. 북부인들은 남부를 지배할 수 없었고 북부와 남부의 교역은 방해 받았다.

그러나 1946년 북부의 압력을 받은 영국은 두 지역을 통합하기로 결정했다. 아랍어가 남부에서도 공용어로 되었고 북부인들은 남부에서 권력을 장악하기 시작했다. 영어로 교육받은 남부 엘리트들은 새 정권에 넣어지지 않았다. 남부 엘리트는 그러한 변화에 분개했다. 독립 이후 하르툼의 북부 엘리트가 대부분의 권력을 잡아 남부에서는 불만이 높아졌다. 

1955년, 북부의 이슬람교도 아랍인의 지배에 대한 남부의 불만이 고조되어, 에카트리아 지방에 있는 남부인의 부대가 반란을 일으켰다. 이 반란은 연방제를 구축하겠다는 약속을 폐기한 것에 대한 반응이었다. 그 후 17년 동안 남부는 지속적으로 반란을 일으켰고 남부 지도자들은 자치나 완전한 독립에 찬성하는 여론을 환기했다.

제2차 수단 내전의 다른 원인은 천연 자원에 있었다. 석유 수출은 수단의 수출 소득의 70%를 차지하는데 중요한 유전 지대는 남부에 있다. 또 나일 강의 지류가 흐르고 강수량이 높기 때문에 남부 수단은 물을 이용하기 수월하고 토질도 비옥한 반면 북부는 사하라 사막의 가장 자리에 있다. 북부는 남부의 천연 자원을 지배하기를 원한 반면 남부는 천연 자원에 대한 통제권을 유지하고 싶었다.

딩카족과 누어인의 전쟁도 동시에 일어나고 있었다.

== 분쟁의 발발 ==

이슬람교도 아랍인이 지배하는 중앙 정부에 대한 지속적인 반란은 남부 수단에 자치권을 주는 아디스 아바바 협정이 조인됨에 따라 1972년에 끝났다. 그러나 1983년 니메이리 정권은 이슬람화의 일환으로 수단을 이슬람 - 아랍 국가로 할 의향을 나타냈다. 남부 수단은 3개 지역 분할되어 이슬람법 샤리아가 강제로 도입되었다. 

1983년 4월 23일 니메이리 대통령은 계엄령을 선언하고 이슬람법 샤리아의 적용을 확대했다. 헌법으로 보장된 권리들은 정지됐다. 북부에서는 임시 법정이 설립되어 절도에 대해 손목을 자르는 일이나 술을 소지한 것에 대해 채찍질을 가하는 것은 일반적인 일이 되었다. 북부에 살고 있는 남부인이나 이슬람을 믿지 않는 사람도 이러한 벌을 받았다. 이러한 사건과 다른 불만이 합해져 내전을 재개시켰다.

존 가랑의 지도 하에 1983년 비아랍인이 중심이 되어 수단 인민해방군이 설립됐다. 수단 인민해방군은 중앙 정부와 싸우고 독립된 남부 수단 국가를 건설하려 했다. 

1984년 9월 니메이리 대통령은 계엄령을 끝내고 임시 법정을 폐지하겠다고 발표했다. 그러나 임시 법정이 해왔던 일들은 새 법으로 계속됐다. 비이슬람교도의 권리는 존중된다는 니메이리의 보장에도 불구하고 남부인과 다른 비이슬람교도는 중앙 정부의 의도를 의심하지 않을 수 없었다.

=== 무기 공급 === 

수단 정부는 여러 국가들로부터 무기를 공급받았다. 독립 이후 수단 군은 영국에 의해 훈련되었고 무기도 영국으로부터 공급받았다. 그러나 6일 전쟁 이후 영국과의 관계는 단절됐다. 미국과 서독과의 관계도 단절됐다.
