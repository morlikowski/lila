'''Condition Zero Deleted Scenes''' é um bônus do jogo Counter Strike desenvolvido pela Valve. Os vestígios que restaram das diferentes etapas de desenvolvimento de Condition Zero não foram descartados. Pelo contrário, a Valve os compilou e eles se tornaram uma espécie de bônus para os compradores de Condition Zero, ou de consolo para os que esperavam ver algo radicalmente diferente na continuação.

O modo Deleted Scenes reúne missões dos projetos que foram abortadas durante a produção de Condition Zero. Em uma das fases, o helicóptero do jogador é abatido e ele precisa se virar aniquilando todos os inimigos.

Por se tratar de um material inacabado, o modo Deleted Scenes contém uma série de erros e falhas, mas vale a pena ser visto e, mais do que isso, mostra que a decisão da Valve de manter o estilo consagrado por Counter-Strike, pelo menos dentro dessas circunstâncias, foi acertada: se Condition Zero fosse o que se vê em Deleted Scenes, com certeza fracassaria, por causa da fórmula manjada de disparar em tudo o que se move.

'''''Counter-Strike: Condition Zero''''' (abbreviated '''CS: CZ''' or just '''CZ''') is the newer version of the multiplayer game, ''Counter-Strike''. The game was released in 2004 using the GoldSrc ''Half-Life'' engine. CS: CZ features a multiplayer mode, which mostly features updated character models, textures, maps and other graphical tweaks. Unlike other Counter-Strike games, Condition Zero also contains a single player mission pack with the player unlocking maps and more efficient bots as they pass certain requirements for each map while playing as a counter terrorist. These requirements include targets such as, "Kill 3 enemies with a glock" or "Win a round in 45 seconds." Condition Zero also contains bots with better AI than other Counter-Strike games.

As of 2008, the game is one of the ten most played ''Half-Life'' modifications in terms of players, according to GameSpy.<ref></ref>

==Development==
===Counter-Strike: Condition Zero maps===
Condition Zero maps are generally re-made ''Counter-Strike'' maps featuring newer textures and effects. As of 2008, some Condition Zero maps now contain advertising. Several new maps made by Turtle Rock Studio were also incorporated into the Xbox version of Counter-Strike.

==Clans and Communities==

Clans and Communities are groups of players which play together under a single name, usually displayed as a shortened version known as a "tag" in their in-game name. Clans tend to be more tight knit than communities, and are often made up of around 10 - 50 people. Communities are typically much larger and generally consist of more than 50 players. This group aspect of the game is one of the reasons it is so popular many years after its release. Clans and Communities often run or rent their own servers which they administer themselves.

==Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes==
'''''Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes''''' were what was left over from Ritual Entertainment's dropped share of development. A series of 18 unconnected single-player missions, ''Deleted Scenes'' were originally the focus on the game with standard multiplayer thrown in too. However, after declaring the game gold and handing out review copies of Ritual's work, Valve saw an average review score of around just 60%. The companies retracted the gold status and work on ''CZ'' was essentially begun again. The final game contained Ritual's portion, called ''Deleted Scenes'', alongside Turtle Rock Studios's version of the game.
