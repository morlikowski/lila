A '''sandwich''' is a food item made of two or more slices of leavened oil, mustard or other condiments to enhance flavor and texture. 

==History==
The first form of sandwich is attributed to the ancient Jewish sage Paschal lamb and bitter herbs inside matzo (or flat,unleavened bread) during Passover. The filling between the matzos served as a reminder to Israelites of their forced labor constructing Egyptian buildings..

During the open-face sandwiches<ref>[http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/SandwichHistory.htm What's Cooking America], ''Sandwiches, History of Sandwiches''. February 2, 2007.</ref> as they were of disposable dishware. The immediate cultural precursor with a direct connection to the English sandwich  was to be found in seventeenth-century Holland, where the naturalist John Ray observed<ref>Ray, ''Observations topographical, moral, & physiological; made in a journey through part of the Low Countries, Germany, Italy, and France...'' (vol. I, 1673) quoted in Simon Schama, ''The Embarrassment of Riches'' (1987:152).</ref> that in the taverns beef hung from the rafters "which they cut into thin slices and eat with bread and butter laying the slices upon the butter"— explanatory specifications that reveal the Dutch ''belegde broodje'' was as yet unfamiliar in England.
 
The first written usage of the English word appeared in Edward Gibbon's journal, in longhand, referring to "bits of cold meat" as a 'Sandwich'.<ref>''OED'' gives its appearance as 1762.</ref> It was named after John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, an 18th-century English aristocrat, although he was neither the inventor nor sustainer of the food. It is said that Lord Sandwich was fond of this form of food because it allowed him to continue playing cards, particularly cribbage, while eating without getting his cards greasy from eating meat with his bare hands.<ref>[http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/SandwichHistory.htm Sandwiches: History of Sandwiches]</ref>

The rumour in its familiar form appeared in Pierre Jean Grosley's ''Londres'' (Neichatel, 1770), translated as ''A Tour to London'' 1772;<ref>Grosley, ''Londres'' (Neuchatel, 1770) and ''A Tour to London, or, New observations on England and its inhabitants, translated from the French by Thomas Nugent''
(London : Printed for Lockyer Davis) 1772;  [http://www.faktoider.nu/sandwich.html Hexmasters Faktoider: Sandwich]: English quotes from Grosley 1772</ref> Grosley's impressions had been formed during a year in London, 1765. The sober alternative is provided by Sandwich's biographer, N.A.M. Rodger, who suggests Sandwich's commitments to the navy, to politics and the arts mean the first sandwich was more likely to have been consumed at his desk.

It is also possible that Sandwich's wife's sister's husband, Jerome de Salis, who was born in the Grisons Republic of Switzerland, taught him about sandwiches.<!--his --> 

If it was initially perceived as food men shared while gaming and drinking at night, the sandwich slowly began appearing in polite society as a late-night meal among the aristocracy. The sandwich's popularity in Spain and England increased dramatically during the 19th century, when the rise of an industrial society and the working classes made fast, portable, and inexpensive meals essential.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Food and Culture'', Solomon H. Katz, editor (Charles Scribner's Sons: New York) 2003</ref>

It was at the same time that the sandwich finally began to appear outside of Europe. In the United States, the sandwich was first promoted as an elaborate supper meal. By the early 20th century, as bread became a staple of the American diet, the sandwich became the same kind of popular, quick meal as was widespread in the Mediterranean.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Food and Culture,'' Solomon H. Katz, editor (Charles Scribner's Sons: New York) 2003</ref>

'''Са́ндвич''', '''сэ́ндвич'''<ref>В русском орфографическом словаре булки) и одного или нескольких слоёв мяса и/или других начинок.

Особенно в английских больших городах сандвич стал неотъемлемой частью культуры питания. В Subway и Burger King.

В США распространены сандвичи треугольной формы, называемые «клубными сандвичами». Клубные сандвичи часто продаются по две штуки в пластиковых или картонных упаковках.

== Отличие от бутерброда ==
Французский вариант сандвича называется Croque; немецкий бутерброд отличается от сандвича тем, что отсутствует коннотация фастфуда и второй кусок хлеба.

== История ==
Сандвич был назван по имени Джона Монтегю, 4-го графа Сандвичского (1718—1792), лондонского министра и игрока, который по легенде в 1762 г. его изобрёл. Во время игры в криббедж, которая длилась уже несколько часов, он не нашёл времени поесть. Джон Монтегю заказал у слуги, чтобы ему подали еду между двумя ломтиками хлеба. Его друзьям-игрокам понравился такой способ еды без отрыва от игры, и они тоже заказали хлеб «по-сандвичски».
По другой версии, тот же граф Сандвич любил охотиться. И вот его слуга, чтобы графу было удобно во время долгой охоты, придумал класть начинку между ломтиками хлеба.
