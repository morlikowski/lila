'''''Der Schuh des Manitu''''' (English: ''Manitou's Shoe'', literally ''The Shoe of [the] Manitou'') is a German western films. Directed by Michael Herbig, it is a film adaptation of the Manitou sketches from his Pro Sieben television show ''Bullyparade''. 

==The Movie==

The movie copies the parodies of Greek character Dimitri owns a mule named Apollo 13 (his twelve brothers - and subsequently, he as well - were killed by speeding trains), and for lack of a hatchet the Shoshones, a Native American tribe, dig out a folding-chair they had buried.

The movie has several references to the Karl May movies of the 1960s and to Herbig's own TV show. It features many puns that are difficult to translate into English. In the German version, Abahachi, Ranger and Winnetouch all speak with a rather strong Bavarian accent that is predominant in the Bullyparde-Show, which is mentioned by the barkeeper at the saloon by ''"You must be Ranger, the man with the Southern States accent"''.

Many scenes have been shot in Indians in the movie are actually Spanish.  The Shoshone chief is played by an East Indian, for humorous effect, and his two advisors are Native Americans.  have been played by true Native Americans. According to Herbig's comments, some Spanish can be heard on the DVD, and he was never entirely sure if the Spanish actors really knew what kind of movie they were participating in. The Mexican Hombre is played by Hilmi Sözer, a Turkish-German actor.

==The Winnetou Novels==
„Der Schuh des Manitu“ parodies a series of wild west adventure novels of the 19th century German author Karl May.

The main topic of these novels is the deep friendship of a fictional Native Americans in Germany. Many shots of the original Winnetou movies feature Old Shatterhand and Winnetou riding side by side, accompanied by romantic orchestral music (which is also happening in the parody).

Winnetou’s main objection against European settlers is their "greed." He dislikes that they want to take ''all'' the land for themselves and cannot share with the natives. A recurring opponent is the bandit Santer who kills Winnetou's father and sister, probably the namesake of Santa Maria in the parody.
