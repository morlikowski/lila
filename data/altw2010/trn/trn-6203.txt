250px|thumb|The symbols of the Movement - The '''Red Cross''' and the '''Red Crescent''' emblems at the [[Red Cross Museum|museum in Geneva. The '''Red Crystal''' emblem has just recently joined them.]]
The '''emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement''', under the Geneva Conventions, are to be placed on humanitarian and medical vehicles and buildings to protect them from military attack on the battlefield.  There are four such emblems, three of which are in use:  the '''Red Cross''', the '''Red Crescent''', and the '''Red Crystal'''.  The '''Red Lion and Sun''' is also a recognized emblem, but is no longer in use.

There were also prior disputes concerning the use of a Red Star of David by Magen David Adom (MDA), the Israeli first-aid society; the Red Crystal was created in response to these disputes, thus enabling the admission of MDA to the movement.

== History of the emblems ==
===Emblems in use===
====The Red Cross====

The '''Red Cross''' emblem was officially approved in Swiss flag with colors reversed.

The Red Cross flag is not to be confused with the St George cross which is the flag of England, Barcelona, Freiburg and several other places. In order to avoid this confusion the protected symbol is sometimes referred to as the "Greek Red Cross"; that term is also used in United States law to describe the Red Cross. The red cross of the St George cross extends to the edge of the flag, whereas the red cross on the Red Cross flag does not. The Red Cross was originally intended to be a reverse image of the flag of Switzerland, a historically neutral nation.

====The Red Crescent====

The '''Red Crescent''' emblem was first used by ICRC volunteers during the armed conflict between Russia and Turkey (1877–1878). The symbol was officially adopted in 1929, and so far 25 Islamic states have recognized it.

Originally, only the Red Cross was to be used as an emblem of the Geneva Conventions, but because it reminded Crusaders, most of the Muslim nations (primarily the Ottoman Empire, later Turkey) objected to this, and as a result an additional emblem (the '''Red Crescent''') was to be provided for.

Though the crescent is traditionally associated with Islam, the Red Crescent is a color reversal of the Ottoman flag, which was later adapted into the modern flag of Turkey, except that the Red Crescent does not have a star and is usually centered on its white ground.

Iran also adopted the Red Crescent in 1980 after abandoning the Red Lion and Sun (see below).

====The Red Crystal====
left|100px|
On December 8 2005, partly in response to growing pressure to accommodate Magen David Adom as a full member of the Red Cross & Red Crescent movement, a new emblem (officially the '''Third Protocol Emblem''', but more commonly known as the '''Red Crystal''') was adopted by an amendment of the Geneva Conventions known as Protocol III.  The new emblem was designed to be easily recognizable and, to make it more universally acceptable throughout different cultures, devoid of religious connotation (contrasting the Red Cross and Red Crescent, which are often associated with Christianity and Islam, respectively).  No country or national society is obliged to change their emblems, and none are obliged to use the new one; but all are required to respect it in the same manner as the other emblems.

Societies can choose to use the Red Crystal emblem alongside the Red Cross and/or Red Crescent emblems, or as a border for a Red Cross or Red Crescent emblem.  Societies that use other emblems may, with prior approval, use their own emblems alongside or inside the Red Crystal; at present, the only such society is Magen David Adom (MDA).  Alternatively, the emblem can be used alone, which may be useful in areas where religious strife may lead to confusion over the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.

On 22 June 2006, along with its recognition of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and MDA, the ICRC announced the formal adoption in its statutes of the Red Crystal as a third official symbol.<ref name="ICRC PR 06-65">[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/geneva-news-220606?opendocument ICRC website — Press Release 06/65], 22-06-2006</ref>  As of 14 January 2007, Protocol III is in full effect, and the Red Crystal emblem is now fully recognized under the Geneva Conventions by the nations that have ratified the protocol. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6260353.stm BBC News (2007-01-14): Red Crystal gets official status]</ref>

Eritrea has said it is planning to use the new symbol, because the country has a mixture of Christians and Muslims.

===Recognized emblems in disuse===
====The Red Lion and Sun====

The '''Red Lion and Sun Society of Iran''' was established in 1922 and admitted to the Red Cross & Red Crescent movement in 1923.<ref>[http://www.rcs.ir/en/index.php?page_id=2&menu_id=1&menu_item_id=3 History of the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) (IRCS website, in English)]</ref> However, some report the symbol was introduced at Geneva in 1864 <ref>[http://www.rcs.ir/fa/index.php?page_id=3&menu_id=1&menu_item_id=33 IRCS website, in Persian]</ref><!-- Both "fact" and reference tags are appropriate; even if the Iranian Red Crescent Society claims the Red Lion and Sun was proposed in 1864 (I can't be sure as I can't read Persian, but the URL is theirs per Whois), it is inconsistent with the first recorded use of the Red Crescent in 1876-1878. --> as a counter example to the crescent and cross used by two of Iran's rivals, the Ottoman and the Russian empires.  Though that claim is inconsistent with the Red Crescent's history, that history also suggests that the Red Lion and Sun, like the Red Crescent, may have been conceived during the 1877-1878 war between Russia and Turkey.

In 1980, because of the association of the emblem with the Shah, the newly proclaimed Islamic Republic of Iran replaced the Red Lion and Sun with the Red Crescent, consistent with most other Muslim nations. Though the Red Lion and Sun has now fallen into disuse, Iran has in the past reserved the right to take it up again at any time; the Geneva Conventions continue to recognize it as an official emblem, and that status was confirmed by Protocol III even as it added the Red Crystal.

===Unrecognized emblems===
====The Red Star of David (Magen David Adom)====
100px|left
For over 50 years, Christian and Muslim emblems were recognized, the corresponding Jewish emblem should be as well. This emblem is the one used by Magen David Adom (MDA), the national first-aid society of Israel, but it is still not recognized by the Geneva Conventions as a protected symbol.

The Red Cross & Red Crescent movement repeatedly rejected Israel's request over the years, stating that the Red Cross emblem was not meant to represent Christianity but was a color reversal of the Swiss flag, and also that if Jews (or another group) were to be given another emblem, there would be no end to the number of religious or other groups claiming an emblem for themselves. They reasoned that a proliferation of red symbols would detract from the original intention of the Red Cross emblem, which was to be a single emblem to mark vehicles and buildings protected on humanitarian grounds.

Certain Arab nations, such as Syria, also protested the entry of MDA into the Red Cross movement, making consensus impossible for a time.  However, from 2000 to 2006 the American Red Cross withheld its dues (a total of $42 million) to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) because of IFRC's refusal to admit MDA [http://www.redcross.org/mda/]; this ultimately led to the creation of the Red Crystal emblem and the admission of MDA on June 22, 2006.

The Red Star of David is not recognized as a protected symbol outside Israel; instead the MDA uses the Red Crystal emblem during international operations in order to ensure protection.  Depending on the circumstances, it may place the Red Star of David inside the Red Crystal, or use the Red Crystal alone.

====Other proposed symbols====

Various other countries have also lobbied for alternative symbols, which have been rejected because of concerns of territorialism.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

*Red Lamb (Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)) - Used by one of several rival societies in 1963 to 1964.
*Red Wheel (India) - Hindu swastika design proposed after the Indian independence movement, but abandoned in favor of the Red Cross.
*Hakuai Sha (Japan) - Founded in 1877, but adopted the Red Cross in 1887.
*Red Cedar (Lebanon) - Suggested after the Lebanese Civil War, but abandoned in favor of the Red Cross.

In 1922 a Warlord era. The swastika is used in East Asia as a symbol to represent Dharma or Buddhism in general. While the organization has organized philanthropic relief projects (both domestic and international), as a sectarian religious body it is ineligible for recognition from the International Committee. Its headquarters are now in Taiwan.

== Use of the emblems ==
thumb|250px|Belgian Red Cross volunteers
As specified by the Geneva Conventions, the four recognized emblems are to be used only to denote the following:
* facilities for the care of injured and sick armed forces members;
* armed forces medical personnel and equipment; 
* military chaplains; 
* International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and the 185 national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies.

In order to ensure universal respect for the emblems, the Geneva Conventions obliged their signatories to forbid any other use of the names and emblems in wartime and peacetime.  

Nevertheless, the misuse of the emblem is widespread and it is often used as a general symbol to indicate first aid, medical supplies and civilian medical services especially walk-in clinics. Misuses appear in movies (A notable example is The Living Daylights <ref></ref><ref>[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JMB9 Protection of the red cross and red crescent emblems and the repression of misuse]</ref>, wherein narcotics were disguised as Red Cross care packages, as a plot device), on television, and in computer software and games. Service companies, such as those for car repair or lawn maintenance, tout themselves as service "doctors" and incorporate medical symbols to promote themselves.

A '''Bandeira do Diamante Vermelho''' ou alternativamente, do Cristal Vermelho (oficialmente, o "Emblema do Terceiro Protocolo") é o novo emblema, neutro de significados políticos e religiosos, aprovado pelo movimento da Cruz Vermelha Internacional.right|thumb|180px|Diamante vermelho

O emblema foi votado em 8 de dezembro de 2005, com 98 votos a favor, 27 contra e dez abstenções (além de 57 sociedades nacionais que não compareceram à votação).

Entre os países que manifestaram interesse pelo novo emblema ou suas variações encontram-se o Estado de Eritréia.

The '''Red Crystal flag''' is the new politically (and religiously) neutral emblem approved by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.  This emblem clears a hurdle for the Magen David Adom to join the International Committee of the Red Cross.
 
== Rationale ==
left|thumb|Photo of the new flag at the conference that approved it
Because of the controversy over USSR until its demise.

The problem was that adding a new protection symbol to the Geneva Conventions required convening a diplomatic conference of all 192 signatory states. The Swiss government organized such a conference, which took place from 5 December to 8 December 2005, to decide on the issue of adopting the Red Crystal as a third protocol to the Geneva Conventions, having equal status with the Red Cross and Red Crescent. The emblem was voted in on 8 December 2005, with the vote count being 98 in favor, 27 opposed, and 10 abstentions&mdash;57 national societies were absent at the vote. Other than Cuba and China, most of the dissent against the use of the Red Crystal symbol came from Arab and Muslim states. The icon was given the neutral status as a "symbol of all nations," and thus one without any specific religious, cultural, or ethnic relevance that could prove divisive. 

==Usage ==

The emblem's official name is the "Third Protocol emblem". The rules for the use of this symbol, based on the proposed third additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions, will be the following:

* Within its own national territory, a national society could use either of the recognized symbols alone, or incorporate any of these symbols or a combination of them into the Red Crystal. Furthermore, a national society can choose to display a previously and effectively used symbol, after officially communicating this symbol to the state parties of the Geneva Conventions through Switzerland as the depositary state prior to the adoption of the third additional protocol. 

* For indicative use on foreign territory, a national society which does not use one of the recognized symbols as its emblem would have to incorporate its unique symbol into the Red Crystal (known in vexillological terms as "defacing the flag"), based on the previously mentioned condition about communicating its unique symbol to the state parties of the Geneva Conventions.
