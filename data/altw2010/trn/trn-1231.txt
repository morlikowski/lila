'''Football Club Partizan''' (Serbian: ФК Партизан, ''Fudbalski klub Partizan'') is a football club from Sports Association Partizan'''. The second division team FK Teleoptik is also owned by Partizan. According to UEFA, Partizan has the second-ranking youngster school in Europe, after Ajax Amsterdam.<ref name="School"></ref> According to a recent poll, Partizan Belgrade is the second most popular football club in Serbia, with 32.2 percent of the population supporting the club.<ref name="Poll"></ref>.

== History ==

Partizan was founded on partisans, the communist resistance military formation during the World War II in Yugoslavia. The club is still a member of the same sports association, which includes 25 clubs in different sports, as well as the Football Association of Serbia, but it has complete independence regarding organisation, management, finances, material goods and facilities.

The club was initially formed under Yugoslav People's Army, and the stadium was named for most of the time Stadion JNA (Stadium of Yugoslav People's Army). In the early 50's club became independent from the Army. The first international match was played on December 6, 1945, against CSKA Moscow (then known as CDKA). 

Partizan participated in the first ever European Cup game, that took place on Sporting. Final result of this game was 3-3. Partizan also became the first club from European Cup final against Real Madrid, after eliminating Manchester United in the semifinals. In more recent years, the club played in 2003/04 UEFA Champions League season, after eliminating Newcastle United in the last qualifying round and also in the round of 16 of the UEFA Cup in the 2004/2005 season.

Partizan's current colors are black and white, after blue and red for the first thirteen years.

== Fans ==

thumb|270px|Grobari
Partizan's fans, known as Grobari (Gravediggers), were formed in 1970. The nickname itself was given by their biggest rivals F.C. Red Star Belgrade fans, referring to club's mostly black colours which were similar to official uniforms of cemetery undertakers. The other theory is that the name arrives from the Partizan's stadium street name - Humska (Graves').
They generally support all clubs in the Sports Association Partizan. In 1999, organized fans who traditionally occupy South stands at the stadium split into two groups. Newly formed group named ''Južni Front'' (South Front) accused several top members of Grobari organization for abusing their privileges, and the club itself for favoring those individuals.
Last year fans settled their differences and today there are three major fan groups: "Južni Front", "Grobari 1970" and "Grobari Beograd".In November 2005, all fan groups are boycotting the FC Partizan matches until sports director Nenad Bjeković and general secretary Žarko Zečević resign. Bjeković finally resigned in May, and Zečević in September 2007. As a result of their demands being accepted, the Grobari returned to the stands of Stadion Partizana.

The Grobari have a strong bond with Gate 4, the supporters of Greek club PAOK FC. Sharing the same club colors and extreme "die hard" mentality, both groups help each other in battle against rival clubs. 
This dedication and appreciation surpasses friendship so they consider themselves brothers.
In the 2007-2008 season, a coalition between the two groups caused great upset when they attacked Red Star Belgrade fans during a basketball game. 
The organized attack showed the bond between the two groups and the willingness to fight for each other. Both groups are amongst the most feared fans in Europe, due to the ruthlessness and willingness to die for their club.

Danny Dyer featured the Grobari on the ''Real Football Factories International'' show. In the episode he labelled the Grobari as a wild group willing to do anything for the respect of the club. <ref name="Real Football Factories"></ref>

The club's stadium is now named "Stadion Partizana", although it was known as "Stadion JNA" (Stadium of the Yugoslav People's Army) for most of its history, and is still sometimes called that.

The sports centre "Partizan-Teleoptik", also known as "Zemunelo" (the name being composed to show the resemblance to the Teleoptik, down to the youngest categories of large Partizan family.

The stadium is expected to be redesigned by Swiss firm Mob Lab. The new capacity is to be approximately 45,000 seats and will include a very modern business park filled with hotels and office buildings. <ref></ref>
