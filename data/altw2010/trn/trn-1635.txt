'''Sly & the Family Stone''' - американський гурт, утворений 1966 року у Сан-Франциско, Каліфорнія. До складу гурту ввійшли: Слай Стоун (''Sly Stone''), справжнє ім'я Сілвестр Стюарт (''Sylvester Stewart'', 15 березня 1944, Далас, Техас, США) — вокал, клавішні, труба, саксофон; Фредді Стоун (''Freddie Stone''), справжнє ім'я Фредерік Стюарт (''Frederic Stewart'', 5 червня 1964, Далас, Техас, США) — гітара, вокал; Роузі Стоун (''Rosie Stone''), справжнє ім'я Роуз Бенкс (''Rose Banks'', 21 березня 1945,  Валлежо, Каліфорнія, США) — клавішні, вокал; Сінтія Робінсон (''Cynthia   Robinson'', 12 січня 1946,  Сакраменто, Каліфорнія, США) - труба, вокал; Джеррі Мартіні (''Jerry Martini'', 1 жовтня 1943, Колорадо, США) — саксофон; Леррі Грейем (''Larry Graham'', 14 серпня 1946, Бімонт, Техас, США) — бас, вокал та Грег Ерріко (''Greg Errico'', 1 вересня 1946, Сан-Франциско, Каліфорнія) - ударні.

Слай Стоун розпочав свою музичну кар'єру ще 1948 року. Як вундеркінд взяв участь, граючи на ударних та на гітарі, у запису синглу "On The Battlefield For My Lord" гурту ''The Stewart Four'', яка складалась із членів його родини.
У середній школі він співав у гурті ''The Vicanes'', а від кінця п'ятдесятих виступав у різних барах та клубах Норт Бічч у Сан-Франциско. Слай був членом багатьох формацій, таких як, ''Joe Piazza & The Continentals'', та лідером власної. У цей період з'явився його сингл "Long Time Away", який видала фірма "G & Р". Стоун також працював диск-жокеєм на радіостанціях "KSOL" та "KDIA", а пізніше був запрошений до фірми "Autumn Records" у якості композитора, автора текстів та продюсера. 1964 року пісня "C'mon & Swim" його підопічного Боббі Фрімена здобуває великий успіх, проте власний сингл Слая "І Just Learned How To Swim" не мав такого успіху на топ-аркушах, як і наступний "Buttermilk Pts 1 & 2". Однак заслуги Стоуна у продюсерській діяльності були оцінені дуже високо. Такі гурти, як ''The Beau Brummels'', ''The Tikis'' та ''The Mojo Men'' були дуже вдячні йому за появу у кожного  власного  звучання.

1966 року Слай утворив гурт ''The Stones'', який за рік перетворився на формацію ''Sly & The Family Stone'' і дебютував синглом "І Ain't Got Nobody", який видала локальна фірма "Loadstone". Пізніше гурт уклав угоду з "Epic Records" і незабаром з'явився його дебютний альбом "A Whole New Thing". Проте успіх до гурту прийшов лише 1968 року, коли сингл "Dance To The Music" злетів до Тор 10 у США та Британії. Ще одним хітом став черговий сингл "Everyday People", який окупував перше місце американського чарту на початку 1969 року. Того ж року ''Sly & The Family Stone'' випустили свій найкращий і найпопулярніший альбом "Stand!", який розійшовся у кількості двох мільйонів примірників, а заглавний твір та "І Want To Take You Higher" і "Sex Machine", що пульсували новим ритмом, який включав соул, дууоп та сан-франциське звучання, назавжди змінили образ "чорної" музики. Сучасні виконавці від Майлз Девіса до Джорджа Клінтона та The Temptations перебували під значним впливом музичний видінь Слая. Вдалий виступ на фестивалі "Woodstock" приніс нову хвилю популярності гурту.

Нове десятиріччя ''Sly & The Family Stone'' розпочали виданням хіт-синглу "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again"/"Everybody Is A Star", який зайняв перше місце у категоріях римт-енд-блюз та поп. На жаль, вдалий період завершувався. Слай почав пропускати концерти, а ті, у яких брав участь, часто розчаровували. Незважаючи на успіх чергового альбому "There's A Riot Goin' On" та трьох синглів — "Family Affair", "Running Away" та "Smilin", — які входили до цього альбому, відчувалось, що це лише радісне відлуння шістдесятих. Наступні роботи, "Fresh" та "Small Talk", засвідчили спад популярності гурту. Зазнав змін і склад ''The Family Stone''. Леррі Грейем утворив власну формацію ''Graham Central Station'', а Грега Ерріко замінив Енді Ньюмарк (''Andy Newmark''). Також новими членами групи стали Пет Різзо (''Pat Rizzo'') — саксофон та Расті Оллен (''Rusty Allen'') - бас. Однією з головних причин розпаду ''Sly & The Family Stone'' 1975 року стала залежність лідера від наркотиків.

1979 року гурт знову зібрався у майже оригінальному складі і записав альбом "Back On The Right Track", але тогорічне концертне турне довелось перервати через наркотичні проблеми Слая Стоуна, а 1987 року його навіть заарештували за вживання кокаїну.

In the preface of his 1998 book ''For the Record: Sly and the Family Stone: An Oral History'', Joel Selvin sums up the importance of Sly & the Family Stone's influence on African American music by stating "there are two types of black music: black music before Sly Stone, and black music after Sly Stone".<ref name=Selvin>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. xi.</ref> The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.

As of 2008, Sly & the Family Stone had reunited for a series of shows beginning with several dates at the House of Blues in Anaheim and West Hollywood California.

The Stewart family was a deeply-religious middle-class household from Denton, Sylvester, Freddie, Rose, and Vaetta) formed "The Stewart Four", who released a local 78 rpm single, "On the Battlefield of the Lord" b/w "Walking in Jesus' Name", in 1952. The eldest sister, Loretta, was the only Stewart child not to pursue a musical career.

While attending Filipino teenager were the only non-white members. The Viscaynes released a few local singles, and Sylvester recorded several solo singles under the name "Danny Stewart".

By 1963, Sylvester had become KSOL, where he included white performers such as Autumn Records, producing for San Francisco-area bands such as The Beau Brummels and The Mojo Men. One of the Sylvester Stewart-produced Autumn singles, Bobby Freeman's "C'mon and Swim", was a national hit record.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 12.</ref> Stewart recorded unsuccessful solo singles while at Autumn.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 8–9.</ref>

===Early years===
In 1966, Sly Stone formed a band called ''Sly & the Stoners'', which included acquaintance Cynthia Robinson on trumpet. Around the same time, Freddie founded a band called ''Freddie & the Stone Souls'', which included Gregg Errico on drums. At the suggestion of Stone's friend, saxophonist Jerry Martini, Sly and Freddie combined their bands, creating Sly & the Family Stone at the end of 1966. Since both Sly and Freddie were guitarists, Sly appointed Freddie the official guitarist for the Family Stone, and taught himself to play the electronic organ. Meanwhile, Sly recruited Larry Graham to play bass guitar.

Vaetta Stewart wanted to join the band as well. She and her friends, Mary McCreary and Elva Mouton, had a gospel group called ''The Heavenly Tones''. Sly recruited the teenagers directly out of high school to become Little Sister, Sly & the Family Stone's background vocalists.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 88; interview with Elva "Tiny" Moulton.</ref>

After the debut single for Sly & the Family Stone, "I Ain't Got Nobody", became a major regional hit for Loadstone Records,<ref name="ErlewineSly"/> CBS Records executive Clive Davis signed the group to CBS' Epic Records label. The Family Stone's first album, ''A Whole New Thing'', was released in 1967 to critical acclaim, particularly from musicians such as Mose Allison and Tony Bennett.<ref name="WholeNew"> Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 59–60; interviews with David Kapralik and Jerry Martini.</ref> However, the album's low sales restricted their playing venues to small clubs, and caused Clive Davis and the record label to intervene.<ref name="WholeNew" /><ref>Fotenot, Robert.

Davis suggested that Sly try to write and record a hit record, and he and the band reluctantly provided the single "Dance to the Music".<ref name="Selvin60">Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 60; interview with Jerry Martini.</ref> Upon its February 1968 release, "Dance to the Music" became a widespread ground-breaking hit, and was the band's first charting single, reaching #8 on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref name="BillboardCharts"></ref> Just before the release of "Dance to the Music", Rose Stone joined the group as a vocalist and a keyboardist. Rose's brothers had invited her to join the band from the beginning, but she initially had been reluctant to leave her steady job at a local record store.<ref name="Selvin60" />

Sly Stone had produced for and performed with both blacks and whites during his early career, and he integrated music by white artists into black radio station KSOL's playlist as a D.J.

===Internal problems and a change of direction===
With the band's newfound fame and success came numerous problems. Relationships within the band were deteriorating; there was friction in particular between the Stone brothers and Larry Graham.<ref> Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 107, 146–152</ref> Epic requested more product.<ref name="Kaliss" /> The Black Panther Party demanded that Sly make his music more militant and more reflective of the black power movement,<ref name="Kaliss" /> replace Greg Errico and Jerry Martini with black instrumentalists, and replace manager David Kapralik.<ref> Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 89; interview with David Kapralik.</ref>

After moving to the Los Angeles area in fall 1969, Sly Stone and his bandmates became heavy users of illegal drugs, primarily PCP.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 94–98</ref> As the members became increasingly focused on drug use and partying (Sly Stone carried a violin case filled with illegal drugs wherever he went),<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 122</ref> recording slowed significantly. Between summer 1969 and fall 1971, the band released only one single, "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)" / "Everybody Is a Star", released in December 1969. Although "Star" was another positive song in the vein of "Everyday People," the single's lead side featured an angry, bitter Sly & the Family Stone, who declared in unison that they could no longer pretend to be something they were not (peaceful, loving, and happy) and disrespectfully thanked the audience "for letting me be myself again."<ref> Hoskyns, Barney (2006-03-26).

He was replaced with a succession of drummers until Sly settled on Gerry Gibson. Gibson only remained with the band for a year before being replaced by Andy Newmark in 1973.

To appease fan demand for new songs, Epic began re-releasing material. ''A Whole New Thing'' was reissued with a new cover, and several of the Family Stone's most popular recordings were packaged into the band's first ''Greatest Hits'' album. ''Greatest Hits'' reached number two on The Billboard 200 in 1970.

During this period, Sly Stone negotiated a production deal with Atlantic Records, resulting in his own imprint, Stone Flower Productions. Stone Flower released four singles, including one by R&B artist Joe Hicks, one by a group called 6IX, and two pop Top 40/R&B Top 10 singles by Little Sister: "You're the One" and "Somebody's Watching You", a cover of a song from ''Stand!''. For unclear reasons, Sly gradually withdrew his attention from Stone Flower, and the label was closed in 1971. Little Sister's "Somebody's Watching You" is one of the first popular recordings to feature the use of a drum machine for its rhythm track.<ref>Stewart, Vaetta.

In the fall of 1971, Sly & the Family Stone returned with a new single, "Family Affair", which became a number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. "Family Affair" was the lead single from the band's long-awaited fifth album, ''There's a Riot Goin' On'', which debuted at number-one on the ''Billboard'' album charts upon its November 1971 release. Instead of the bright, cheery rock-laced soul that had represented the optimistic 1960s, ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' was filled with dark instrumentation, filtered drum machine tracks, and plaintive vocals representing the hopelessness many people were feeling in the early 1970s.<ref>"[http://www.classicbands.com/sly.html Sly and the Family Stone]".
