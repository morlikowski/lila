'''Kongeriket Saudi-Arabia''' (arabisk: , al-Mamlaka al-ʻArabiyya as-Suʻūdiyya), vanligvis omtalt som '''Saudi-Arabia''', er et land med geografisk beliggenhet i Midtøsten, og det største landet på den arabiske halvøy. Landet grenser mot Jordan i nordvest, Irak i nord og nordøst, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain og De forente arabiske emirater i øst, Oman i sørøst og Yemen i sør. Landet grenser også mot Persiabukten i nordøst, og Rødehavet mot vest. Saudi-Arabia har anslagsvis 27,6 millioner innbyggere,<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sa.html «CIA - The World Factbook - Saudi Arabia»</ref> og et areal på omtrent 2&nbsp;150&nbsp;000 km².

Kongeriket Saudi-Arabia blir noen ganger referert til som «De to hellige moskeers land», da med tanke på Abdul-Aziz bin Saud, hvis offensiv startet i 1902 med gjenerobringen av Al-Saud-familiens forfedres hjemby Riyadh, og kulminerte i 1932 med kunngjøringen og anerkjennelsen av Kongeriket Saudi-Arabia.

Saudi-Arabia er det landet i verden som eksporterer mest olje, og denne eksporten smører den saudiske økonomien.<ref>[http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/country/country_energy_data.cfm?fips=SA «U.S. Energy Information Administration - Saudi Arabia Country Energy Profile»]</ref> Olje står for over 90&nbsp;% av landets eksportinntekter og nesten 75&nbsp;% av de statlige inntektene. Dette danner grunnlaget for en velferdsstat,<ref>[http://saudinf.com/main/h814.htm «Social Services 2»]</ref><ref>[http://www.mofa.gov.sa/Detail.asp?InSectionID=1516&InNewsItemID=1746 «Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia-London: The Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia - A Welfare State»]</ref> som regjeringen har hatt problemer med å opprettholde i perioder med lav oljepris.<ref>[http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=164957&Sn=BUSI&IssueID=29274 «Gulf Daily News»</ref> Menneskerettighetsorganisasjoner, som Amnesty International og Human Rights Watch, har gjentatte ganger uttrykt bekymringer angående menneskerettigheter i Saudi-Arabia, bekymringer som har blitt avfeid av den saudiske regjeringen.

==Historie==

Mellom Kong Faisal (regjerte 1964—1975) avskaffet slaveriet og gjennomførte en rekke reformer innen undervisning og helsestell.

Landet har vært politisk knyttet til Storbritannia og USA.  Landet deltok på alliert side i Gulfkrigen mot Irak i 1991, og hadde allierte baser på sitt territorium.  Irak angrep hovedstaden Riyadh med Scud-raketter under krigen.  Det amerikanske militære nærværet har siden blitt sterkt redusert, og landet har fått et mer anspent forhold til USA.

Kong Fahd Ibn Abdel-Aziz al Saud har vært statsoverhode og statsminister siden 1982,
men døde i 2005. 
Halvbroren Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud overtok.

===Flagget===
Saudi-Arabias flagg er et symbol for de arabiske ørkenfolkene. En rekke varianter er blitt brukt etter at wahabittene kom til makten. Grønt skal ha vært profeten Muhammeds foretrukne farge.

The '''Kingdom of Saudi Arabia''' or  '''KSA''' (, '') is the largest country of the Arabian Peninsula. It is bordered by Jordan on the northwest, Iraq on the north and northeast, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates on the east, Oman on the southeast, and Yemen on the south. The Persian Gulf lies to the northeast and the Red Sea to its west. It has an estimated population of 27.6 million, and its size is approximately 2,150,000 square km (830,000 square miles).

The Kingdom is sometimes called "The Land of The Two Holy Mosques" in reference to Mecca and Medina, the two holiest places in Islam. In English, it is most commonly referred to as '''Saudi Arabia''' (pronounced  or ). The Kingdom was founded by Abdul-Aziz bin Saud, whose efforts began in 1902 when he captured the Al-Saud’s ancestral home of Riyadh, and culminated in 1932 with the proclamation, and recognition of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia is the world's leading petroleum exporter and Saudi economy.<ref>[http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/country/country_energy_data.cfm?fips=SA U.S. Energy Information Administration - Saudi Arabia Country Energy Profile]</ref> Oil accounts for more than 90 percent of exports and nearly 75 percent of government revenues, facilitating the creation of a oil prices.<ref>[http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=164957&Sn=BUSI&IssueID=29274 Gulf Daily News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have repeatedly expressed concern about the state of human rights in Saudi Arabia, although these concerns have been dismissed by the Saudi government.

== History ==

left|thumb|250px|The founder of modern Saudi Arabia, [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Abdul Aziz, converses with U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on board a ship returning from the Yalta Conference in 1945]]

Although the region in which the country stands today has an ancient history, the emergence of the Saudi dynasty began in central Arabia in 1744. That year, Ad-Dir'iyyah near Abdul Aziz Al-Saud (known internationally as ''Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud'').

In 1902 at the age of only 22, Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud re-captured Al-Qatif, the rest of Nejd, and Hejaz between 1913 and 1926. On 8 January 1926 Abdul Aziz bin Saud became the King of Hejaz. On 29 January 1927 he took the title King of Nejd (his previous Nejdi title was Sultan). By the Treaty of Jeddah, signed on 20 May 1927, the United Kingdom recognized the independence of Abdul Aziz's realm, then known as the '''Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz'''. In 1932, the principal regions of Al-Hasa, Qatif, Nejd and Hejaz were unified to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Abdul Aziz's military and political successes were not mirrored economically until vast reserves of oil were discovered in March 1938. Development programmes, which were delayed due to the onset of the Second World War in 1939, began in earnest in 1946 and by 1949 production was in full swing. Oil has provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and a great deal of leverage in the international community.

Prior to his death in 1953 Abdul Aziz, aware of the difficulties facing other regional absolute rulers reliant on extended family networks, attempted to regulate the succession.

Saud succeeded to the throne on his father's death in 1953. However, by the early 1960s the Kingdom was in jeopardy due to Saud's economic mismanagement and failure to deal effectively with a regional challenge from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. As a consequence Saud was deposed in favour of Faisal in 1964.

Intra-family rivalry was one of the factors that led to the assassination of Faisal by his nephew, Prince Faisal bin Musa'id, in 1975. He was succeeded by King Khalid until 1982 and then by King Fahd. When Fahd died in 2005, his half-brother Abdullah ascended to the throne.

== Geography ==

thumb|Map of Saudi Arabia

The kingdom occupies about 80 percent of the miles²). Other reputable estimates vary between 1,960,582&nbsp;km²<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html CIA World Factbook - Rank Order: Area]</ref> (756,934&nbsp;mi²) and 2,240,000&nbsp;km² (864,869&nbsp;mi²). The kingdom is commonly listed as the world's 14th largest state.

Saudi Arabia's geography is varied. From the western coastal region (Tihamah), the land rises from sea level to a peninsula-long mountain range (Jabal al-Hejaz) beyond which lies the plateau of Nejd in the center. The southwestern 'Asir region has mountains as high as 3,000 m (9,840&nbsp;ft) and is known for having the greenest and freshest climate in all of the country, one that attracts many Saudis to resorts such as Abha in the summer months. The east is primarily rocky or sandy lowland continuing to the shores of the Persian Gulf. The geographically hostile Rub' al Khali ("Empty Quarter") desert along the country's imprecisely defined southern borders contains almost no life.

Mostly uninhabited, much of the nation's landmass consists of semi-arid regions, with a dwindling traditional xerophytic herbs and shrubs. Less than two percent of the kingdom's total area is arable land. Population centers are mainly located along the eastern and western coasts and densely populated interior oases such as Hofuf and Buraydah. In some extended areas, primarily the Rub' al-Khali and the Arabian Desert, there is no population whatsoever, although the petroleum industry is constructing a few planned communities there. Saudi Arabia has no permanent year-round rivers or lakes; however, its coastline extends for 2640 km (1640&nbsp;miles) and, on the Red Sea side, offers world-class coral reefs, including those in the Gulf of Aqaba.

Native animals include the wolves, and oases. The coastal area on the Red Sea with its marine life.

===Climate ===

Extreme heat and aridity are characteristic of most of Saudi Arabia. It is one of the few places in the world where summer temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) have been recorded, 51.7 °C (124 °F) being the highest ever recorded temperature. In winter, frost or snow can occur in the interior and the higher mountains, although this only occurs once or twice in a decade. Lowest ever recorded temperature is -12.0 °C recorded at Turaif. The average winter temperature range is 8° to 20 °C (47° to 68 °F) in January in interior cities such as Riyadh and 19° to 29 °C (66° to 83 °F) in Jeddah on the Red Sea coast. The average summer range in July is 27° to 43 °C (81° to 109 °F) in Riyadh and 27° to 38 °C (80° to 100 °F) in Jeddah. Nighttime temperatures in the central deserts can be famously chilly even in summer, as the sand gives up daytime heat rapidly once the sun has set. Annual precipitation is usually sparse (up to 100 mm or 4&nbsp;inches in most regions), although sudden downpours can lead to violent flash floods in wadis. Annual rainfall in Riyadh averages 100&nbsp;mm (4&nbsp;inches) and falls almost exclusively between January and May; the average in Jeddah is 54&nbsp;mm (2.1&nbsp;inches) and occurs between November and January.

The central institution of the Saudi Arabian government is the Saudi monarchy. The ''Basic Law of Government'' adopted in 1992 declared that Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by the sons and grandsons of the first king, Abd Al Aziz Al Saud. It also claims that the Qur'an is the constitution of the country, which is governed on the basis of the Sharia (Islamic Law). According to The Economist's Democracy Index, the Saudi government is the ninth most authoritarian regime in the world.

There are no recognized political parties or national elections, except the local elections which were held in the year 2005 when participation was reserved for male citizens only.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3734420.stm Saudi women barred from voting], ''BBC News'', Qur'an schools around the world. The leading members of the royal family choose the king from among themselves with the subsequent approval of the ulema.

Saudi kings have gradually developed a central government. Since 1953, the Council of Ministers, appointed by the king, has advised on the formulation of general policy and directed the activities of the growing bureaucracy. This council consists of a prime minister, the first prime minister and twenty ministers.

Legislation is by resolution of the Council of Ministers, ratified by royal decree, and must be compatible with the Shari'a. A 150-member Consultative Assembly, appointed by the King, has limited legislative rights. Justice is administered according to the Shari'a by a system of religious courts whose judges are appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council, composed of twelve senior jurists. Independence of the judiciary is protected by law. The king acts as the highest court of appeal and has the power to pardon. Access to high officials (usually at a ''majlis''; a public audience) and the right to petition them directly are well-established traditions.

The combination of relatively high oil prices and exports led to a revenues windfall for Saudi Arabia during 2004 and early 2005. For 2004 as a whole, Saudi Arabia earned about $116 billion in net oil export revenues, up 35 percent from 2003 revenue levels. Saudi net oil export revenues are forecast to increase in 2005 and 2006, to $150 billion and $154 billion, respectively, mainly due to higher oil prices. Increased oil prices and consequent revenues since the price collapse of 1998 have significantly improved Saudi Arabia's economic situation, with real GDP growth of 5.2 percent in 2004, and forecasts of 5.7% and 4.8% growth for 2005 and 2006, respectively.

For budget deficit. However, this was based on an extremely conservative price assumption of $19 per barrel for Saudi oil and an assumed production of <!--barrels per day?-->. Both of these estimates turned out to be far below actual levels. As a result, as of mid-December 2004, the Saudi Finance Ministry was expecting a huge budget surplus of $26.1 billion, on budget revenues of $104.8 billion (nearly double the country's original estimate) and expenditures of $78.6 billion (28 percent above the approved budget levels). This surplus is being used for several purposes, including: paying down the Kingdom's public debt (to $164 billion from $176 billion at the start of 2004); extra spending on education and development projects; increased security expenditures (possibly an additional $2.5 billion dollars in 2004; see below) due to threats from terrorists; and higher payments to Saudi citizens through subsidies (for housing, education, health care, etc.). For 2005, Saudi Arabia is assuming a balanced budget, with revenues and expenditures of $74.6 billion each.

In spite of the recent surge in its oil income, Saudi Arabia continues to face serious long-term economic challenges, including high rates of unemployment (12 percent of Saudi nationals),<ref>Ghafour, P.K. Abdul. [http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&section=0&article=95003&d=15&m=4&y=2007 470,000 Saudis Are Jobless, Says Study], ''Arab News'', April 15, 2007. Accessed June 25, 2008.</ref> one of the world's fastest population growth rates, and the consequent need for increased government spending. All of these place pressures on Saudi oil revenues. The Kingdom also is facing serious security threats, including a number of terrorist attacks (on foreign workers, primarily) in 2003 and 2004. In response, the Saudis reportedly have ramped up spending in the security area (reportedly by 50 percent in 2004, from $5.5 billion in 2003). Saudi Arabia's per capita oil export revenues remain far below high levels reached during the 1970s and early 1980s. In 2007, Saudi Arabia's citizens earned around $20,700 per person, versus $22,589 in 1980, but it is catching up. This 80 percent decline in real per capita oil export revenues since 1980 is in large part because Saudi Arabia's young population has nearly tripled since 1980, while oil export revenues in real terms have fallen by over 40 percent (despite recent increases). Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has faced nearly two decades of heavy budget and trade deficits, the expensive 1990-1991 war with Iraq, and total public debt of around $175 billion. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia does have extensive foreign assets (around $110 billion) which provide a substantial fiscal "cushion."

Saudi municipal elections took place in 2005 and some commentators saw this as a first tentative step towards the introduction of democratic processes in the Kingdom, including the legalization of political parties. Other analysts of the Saudi political scene were more skeptical.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4252079.stm 'Islamist win' in key Saudi poll], ''BBC News'', February 11, 2005. Accessed June 25, 2008.</ref>

==== Law ====

The Basic Law, in 1992, declared that Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by the progeny of King Abd Al Aziz Al Saud. It also declared the Islamic law.<ref name = Jurist>[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm Saudi Arabia]. JURIST</ref>

Criminal cases are tried under Sharia courts in the country. These courts exercise authority over the entire population including foreigners (regardless of religion). Cases involving small penalties are tried in Shari'a summary courts. More serious crimes are adjudicated in Shari'a courts of common pleas. Courts of appeal handle appeals from Shari'a courts.<ref name = Jurist/>

Civil cases may also be tried under Sharia courts with one exception: Shia may try such cases in their own courts. Other civil proceedings, including those involving claims against the Government and enforcement of foreign judgments, are held before specialized administrative tribunals, such as the Commission for the Settlement of Labor Disputes and the Board of Grievances.<ref name = Jurist/>

Main sources of Saudi law are Hanbali fiqh as set out in a number of specified scholarly treatises by authoritative jurists, other schools of law, state regulations and royal decrees (where these are relevant), and custom and practice.<ref name =emory>[http://www.law.emory.edu/ifl/legal/saudiarabia.htm Saudi Arabia, Kingdom of]</ref>

The Saudi legal system prescribes homosexual activity, and floggings, for less serious crimes against public morality such as drunkenness.<ref>[http://hrw.org/backgrounder/mena/saudi/saudi.pdf Human Rights in Saudi Arabia: A Deafening Silence]</ref>
Murder, accidental death and bodily harm are open to punishment from the victim's family. Retribution may be sought in kind or through blood money. The blood money payable for a woman's accidental death is half as much as that for a man.<ref>[http://www.jeansasson.com/law_and_government.htm Saudi Arabian Government and Law]</ref> The main reason for this is that, according to Islamic law, men are expected to be providers for their families and therefore are expected to earn more money in their lifetimes. The blood money from a man would be expected to sustain his family, for at least a short time. Honor killings are also not punished as severely as murder. This generally stems from the fact that honor killings are within a family, and done to compensate for some dishonorable act committed. Slavery was abolished in 1962.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_8.shtml BBC - Religion & Ethics - Islam and slavery: Abolition]</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24160 Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History]</ref>

=== Human rights ===

Several international human rights organizations, such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the United Nations Human Rights Committee have issued reports critical of the Saudi legal system and its human rights record in various political, legal, and social areas, especially its severe limitations on the rights of women. The Saudi government typically dismisses such reports as being outright lies or asserts that its actions are based on its adherence to Islamic law.

In 2002, the United Nations Committee against Torture criticized Saudi Arabia over the amputations and floggings it carries out under the Shari'a. The Saudi delegation responded defending its legal traditions held since the inception of Islam in the region 1300 years ago and rejected "interference" in its legal system.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1992027.stm Saudi 'torture' condemned by UN], ''BBC News'', May 16, 2002. Accessed June 25, 2008.</ref>

Saudi Arabia is also the only country in the world where women are banned from driving on public roads.<ref>Hassan, Ibtihal; Hammond, Andrew. [http://www.reuters.com/article/basicindustries-SP-A/idUSL1071429920071210 Car makers target Saudi women despite driving ban], ''Reuters'', December 10, 2007.

The Government views its interpretation of Islamic law as its sole source of guidance on human rights. In 2000, the Government approved the October legislation, which the Government claimed would address some of its obligations under the Convention Against Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.<ref name = Jurist/>

Saudi Arabia's economy is Petroleum-based; roughly 75% of budget revenues and 90% of export earnings come from the oil industry. The oil industry comprises about 45% of Saudi Arabia's gross domestic product, compared with 40% from the private sector (see below). Saudi Arabia officially has about  of oil reserves, comprising about 24% of the world's proven total petroleum reserves.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/international/reserves.html World Proved Reserves of Oil and Natural Gas, Most Recent Estimates]</ref>

The government is attempting to promote growth in the private sector by privatizing industries such as power and telecom. Saudi Arabia announced plans to begin privatizing the electricity companies in 1999, which followed the ongoing privatization of the telecommunications company. Shortages of water and rapid population growth may constrain government efforts to increase self-sufficiency in agricultural products.

In the 1990s, Saudi Arabia experienced a significant contraction of oil revenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita income fell from a high of $11,700 at the height of the oil boom in 1981 to $6,300 with in 1998.<ref>[http://www.jica.go.jp/english/global/pov/profiles/pdf/sau_eng.pdf Country Profile Study on Poverty: Saudi Arabia]</ref> Recent oil price increases have helped boost per capita GDP to $17,000 in 2007 dollars,<ref>List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita</ref> or about $7,400 adjusted for inflation.<ref>[http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl CPI Inflation Calculator]</ref>

Recent oil price increases have triggered a second oil boom, pushing Saudi Arabia's budget surplus to $28 billion (110SR billion) in 2005. Tadawul (the Saudi stock market Index) finished 2004 with a massive 76.23% to close at 4437.58 points. Market capitalization was up 110.14% from a year earlier to stand at $157.3 billion (589.93SR billion), which makes it the biggest stock market in the Middle East.‏

OPEC limits its member's oil production based on its "proven reserves." The higher their reserves, the more OPEC allows them to produce. Saudi Arabia's published reserves have shown little change since 1980, with the main exception being an increase of about  between 1987 and 1988.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/crudeoilreserves.xls Crude Oil Reserves]</ref> Some have suggested that Saudi Arabia is greatly exaggerating its reserves and may soon show production declines (see peak oil).

To diversify the economy, Saudi Arabia launched a new city on the western coast with investments exceeding 26.6 billion dollars. The city which is named "King Abdullah Economic City" will be built near al-Rabegh industrial city north to Jeddah. The new city, where construction work started in December 2005, includes a port which is the largest port of the kingdom. Extending along a coastline of 35&nbsp;km, the city will also include petrochemical, pharmaceutical, tourism, finance and education and research areas.

Saudi Arabia officially became a World Trade Organization member in December 2005.

=== Development ===

Saudi Arabia is one of the few fastest growing countries in the world with a high cities (cities will diversify the economy of Saudi Arabia, and will also increase the per capita income to a high level. The King of Saudi Arabia has announced that the cities will be spread around Saudi Arabia to promote diversification for each region and their economy, and the cities will contribute $ 150 billion to the GDP.

However the urban areas of Riyadh and Jeddah will contribute $287 billion dollars by the year 2020.<ref>[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/richest-cities-2020.html Riyadh's Urban area will contribute $ 167 B and Jeddah's will contribute $ 111 Billion]</ref>

== Demographics ==

Saudi Arabia's population as of July 2006 is estimated to be about 27,019,731, including about 5,576,076 resident foreigners. Until the 1960s, a majority of the population was nomadic; but presently more than 95% of the population is settled, due to rapid economic and urban growth. As recently as the 1950s, the Saudi Arabia’s slave population was estimated at 450,000 — 20% of the population.<ref>[http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/slavery.htm Slavery in Islam]</ref><ref>[http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/apr07/page18.html £400 for a Slave]</ref> Slavery was finally abolished in 1962.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated2 /> The birth rate is 29.56 births per 1,000 people. The death rate is 2.62 deaths per 1,000 people. Some cities and oases have densities of more than 1,000 people per square kilometer (2,600/sq&nbsp;mi).

Around 85 percent of Saudis are ethnically Asian and sub-Saharan/Indian: 1.4 million, Filipino: 950,000, Egyptian: 900,000, Syrian: 100,000 and Turkish: 80,000.<ref>[http://www.un.org/esa/population/meetings/EGM_Ittmig_Arab/P02_Kapiszewski.pdf Arab versus Asian migrant workers in the GCC countries]</ref> There are around 100,000 Westerners in Saudi Arabia, most of whom live in compounds or gated communities.

They are not allowed to hold or even apply for Saudi citizenship, as the new law passed by Saudi Arabia's Council of Ministers in October 2004 (which entitles expatriates of all nationalities who have resided in the kingdom for ten years to apply for citizenship, with priority being given to holders of degrees in various scientific fields) has one glaring exception: Palestinians will not be allowed to benefit from the new law because of Arab League instructions barring the Arab states from granting them citizenship in order "to avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their right to return to their homeland."<ref>[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&section=0&article=58980&d=14&m=2&y=2005 Expatriates Can Apply for Saudi Citizenship in Two-to-Three Months]</ref>

== Education ==

When the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932, education was not accessible to everyone and limited to individualized instruction at religious schools in mosques in urban areas. These schools taught Islamic law and basic literacy skills. By the end of the century, Saudi Arabia had a nationwide educational system providing free training from preschool through university to all citizens. The modern Saudi educational system provides quality instruction in diverse fields of modern and traditional arts and sciences. This diversity helps meet the Kingdom's growing need for highly-educated citizens to build on its rapid progress.

The primary education system began in Saudi Arabia in the 1930s. By 1945, King Abdulaziz bin Abdelrahman Al-Saud, the country's founder, had initiated an extensive program to establish schools in the Kingdom. Six years later, in 1951, the country had 226 schools with 29,887 students. In 1954, the Ministry of Education was established, headed by then Prince Fahd bin Abdulaziz as the first Minister of Education. The first university, now known as King Saud University, was founded in Riyadh in 1957.

Today, Saudi Arabia's nationwide public educational system comprises twenty universities, more than 24,000 schools, and a large number of colleges and other educational and training institutions. The system provides students with free education, books and health services and is open to every Saudi. Over 25 percent of the annual State budget is for education including vocational training. The Kingdom has also worked on scholarship programs to send students overseas to the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Malaysia and other nations. Currently thousands of students are being sent to higher-educations programs every year.

The study of Islam remains at the core of the Saudi educational system. The Islamic aspect of the Saudi national curriculum is examined in a recent report by Freedom House.<ref>http://www.freedomhouse.org/religion/news/bn2005/bn-2005-2006-05-23.htm</ref> The report found that in religious education classes (in any religious school), children are taught to deprecate other religions, in addition to other branches of Islam. The Saudi religious studies curriculum is taught outside the Kingdom in madrasah throughout the world.

== Sports ==

Men can often be found playing sports. Women rarely participate in sports, and always away from the presence of men; this often leads to indoor gyms. Even though football is the most popular sport, Saudi Arabia has recently participated in the Summer Olympic Games and in international competitions in volleyball and other sports. The Saudi Arabian national youth baseball team has also participated in the Little League World Series. The Saudi Arabia national football team is often most known for being in four consecutive times in the FIFA World Cup and six times in the AFC Asian Cup, which the team won three times and was runner-up three times. Some popular football players include Majed Abdullah, Mohamed Al-Deayea, Sami Al-Jaber, and Saeed Al-Owairan.
