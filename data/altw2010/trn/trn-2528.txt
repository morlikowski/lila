'''Samuel Phillips Huntington''' (lahir 18 April 1927 di New York, AS) adalah seorang ilmuwan politik Amerika Serikat. Ia adalah Guru Besar sekaligus Ketua Jurusan Ilmu Politik di Universitas Harvard dan Ketua Harvard Academy untuk Kajian Internasional dan Regional, di Weatherhead Center for International Affairs. 

Pada bulan Januari 2000, Huntington meletakkan jabatannya sebagai direktur pada Olin Institute. Selama tahun 1999-2000, ia berkerja untuk meneliti berbagai perubahan yang menonjol menyangkut persoalan identitas nasional Amerika dan implikasi-implikasi dari berbagai perubahan ini terhadap peran Amerika di dunia internasional. Setelah itu, ia mengajar matakuliah dalam bidang kajian, dan matakuliah-matakuliah lainnya dalam bidang perbandingan politik (''comparative potitics'') dan politik global pasca Perang Dingin.

Menulis buku '''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''' (terjemahan peristiwa 11 September (pengeboman menara WTC di New York). Berbekal kerangka buku ini banyak orang melihat perang menumpas terorisme sebagai perbenturan kebudayaan Barat dan Timur, sesuai kerangka pikir yang dituliskan Huntington. Buku ini merupakan karya monumentalnya yang menjadi kontroversi dan memicu polemik di berbagai belahan dunia selama lebih dari tiga tahun.

Bukunya '''Political Order in Changing Societies''' yang ditulis tahun 1968, kerap dilihat sebagai cetak biru model demokratisasi yang mementingkan stabilitas. Pemikiran ini antara lain kuat mempengaruhi model pembangunan politik di Indonesia dalam era Orde Baru. Bagian lain dari tesis dalam buku itu bahwa bersama perubahan masyarakat tingkat partisipasi harus juga meningkat, yang perlu diperhatikan pula oleh para penyusun strategi politik di lapangan.

Bukunya yang kemudian berjudul '''Culture Matters: How Values Shape Human Progress''', yang disuntingnya bersama Lawrence Harrison, dan telah terbit pada bulan Mei 2000.

Buku terakhirnya adalah '''Who Are We: The Challenges to America's National Identity''' terbit Mei 2004. Dalam buku ini terutama Huntington menyoroti identitas Amerika sebagai bangsa pemukim (''settler'') bukan imigran, hal ini berbeda dengan kebanyakan ahli yang melihat Amerika sebagai budaya imigran yang dicangkokkan dari tanah leluhurnya. Para pemukim dalam interaksinya harus membentuk identitas sendiri.

Selama tahun-tahun selanjutnya, Huntington tetap memfokuskan dirinya pada persoalan-persoalan identitas nasional, terutama identitas nasional Amerika.

'''Samuel Phillips Huntington''' (born political scientist who gained prominence through his "coups d'etat'', and for his more recent analysis of threats posed to the U.S. by contemporary immigration.

==Biographical details==

Huntington graduated from decolonized countries. As an adviser to Lyndon Johnson, and in an influential 1968 article, he justified heavy bombardment of the countryside of South Vietnam as a means of driving Viet Cong supporters to the cities. He also was co-author of ''The Crisis of Democracy: On the Governability of Democracies'', a report issued by the Trilateral Commission in 1976. During 1977 and 1978 he was the White House Coordinator of Security Planning for the National Security Council. 

==Notable arguments==
===''Political Order in Changing Societies''===

In the 1970s, Huntington applied his theoretical insights as an advisor to governments, both democratic and dictatorial. In 1972, he met with Medici government representatives in Brazil; a year later he published the report "Approaches to Political Decompression", warning against the risks of a too-rapid political liberalization, proposing graduated liberalization, and a strong party state modeled upon the image of the Mexican PRI. After a prolonged transition, Brazil became democratic in 1985.

Huntington frequently cites Brazil as a success, alluding to his role in his 1988 presidential address to the American Political Science Association, commenting that political science ''played a modest role in this process''. Critics, such as British political scientist Alan Hooper, note that contemporary Brazil has an especially unstable party system, wherein the best institutionalized party, Lula da Silva's Partido dos Trabalhadores (Party of the Workers), emerged in opposition to controlled-transition. Moreover, Hooper claims that the lack of civil participation in contemporary Brazil stems from that top-down process of political participation transition.

=== ''The Clash of Civilizations'' ===

In End of History thesis advocated by Francis Fukuyama.

Huntington expanded "The Clash of Civilizations?" to book length and published it as ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'' in 1996. The article and the book posit that post–Cold War conflict would most frequently and violently occur because of cultural rather than ideological differences. That, whilst in the Cold War, conflict likely occurred between the Capitalist West and the Communist Bloc East, it now was most likely to occur between the world's major civilizations — identifying seven, and a possible eighth: (i) Western, (ii) Latin American, (iii) Islamic, (iv) Sinic (Chinese), (v) Hindu, (vi) Orthodox,  (vii) Japanese, and (viii) the African. This cultural organization contrasts the contemporary world with the classical notion of sovereign states. To understand current and future conflict, cultural rifts must be understood, and culture — rather than the State — must be accepted as the locus of war. Thus, Western nations will lose predominance if they fail to recognize the irreconcilable nature of cultural tensions.

Critics (see ''A.J. Toynbee's controversial religious theories about Asian leaders in the early twentieth century.

=== ''Who Are We'' and immigration ===
Professor Huntington's, latest book, ''American national identity and the possible cultural threat posed to it by large-scale Latino immigration, which Huntington warns could "divide the United States into two peoples, two cultures, and two languages".

=== Other ===

Huntington is credited with coining the phrase ''Davos Man'', referring to global elites who "have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite's global operations". The phrase refers to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where leaders of the global economy meet.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1404411,00.html Davos man's death wish], ''The Guardian'', 3 February 2006</ref>

==The National Academy of Sciences controversy==
<!-- Deleted image removed: right|thumb|150px| -->

In 1986, Prof. Huntington was nominated for membership to the National Academy of Sciences, with his nomination voted by the entire academy, but most votes, by scientists mainly unfamiliar with the nominee, are token votes. Professor Serge Lang, a Yale University mathematician, disturbed this electoral status quo by challenging Prof. Huntington's nomination. Prof. Lang campaigned for others to deny Huntington membership, and eventually succeeded; Prof. Huntington was twice nominated and twice rejected. 

:''In the book Political order in changing societies that Huntington published in 1968 he used pseudo-mathematical arguments to prove that in the 1960s South Africa was a "satisfied society". Lang didn't believe the conclusion so he looked how Huntington justified this claim and saw that he used methodology which was simply not valid. Lang suspected that he was using false pseudo-mathematical argument to give arguments that he wanted to justify greater authority. It was, said Lang:-

:''... a type of language which gives the illusion of science without any of its substance. 

:''Lang fought a vigorous campaign to prevent Huntington becoming a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1986 after he had been nominated. Lang was successful on this occasion and also on a second occasion when Huntington was again nominated. A detailed description of these events was published by Lang in Academia, Journalism, and Politics: A Case Study: The Huntington Case which occupies the first 222 pages of his 1998 book Challenges.''[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Lang.html] Google Books, Contents: [http://books.google.com/books?id=0avTrkyT1VcC&pg=PA560&dq=%22A+case+study%22+intitle:Challenges+inauthor:Serge+inauthor:Lang&lr=&as_brr=0&sig=SVjRSA1oN5MbUah_e3M3lk4KJAs#PPP10,M1]
