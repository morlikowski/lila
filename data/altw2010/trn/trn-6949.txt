== Biography ==

Born in Amsterdam in 1921 to Elisabeth van Collem (daughter of socialist poet Abraham van Collem) and Daniel Koningsberger, he was educated at the University of Amsterdam 1939-41, the University of Zurich 1941-43, and the Sorbonne in 1946.

Escaping occupied Holland with the Resistance (he was a wearer of the Dutch Resistance Cross), he was one of the youngest sergeants in the British Liberation Army, 7 Troop, 4 Commando, working as an interpreter during the allied occupation of Germany at the end of the war. 

As an editor of the ''Groene Amsterdammer'', a Dutch weekly, 1947-50, he was invited to run a cultural program on Radio Jakarta,  Indonesia which he did from 1950-51. It was after this that he came by freighter to the United States. His first novel, ''The Affair'', was published in 1958. He also began writing non-fiction, including several travel books, including ''Love and Hate in China'' (1966).

During the Vietnam War he turned his attention to protest, helping to found the still-active ‘Resist’ organization in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with Noam Chomsky among others.

For the next thirty years he wrote fiction and non-fiction and was a two-time recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship for creative writers, for fiction. Four of his novels were made into films: ''A Walk with Love and Death'', which was Anjelica Huston’s first film, directed by her father, John Huston, ''The Revolutionary'', starring Jon Voight, ''Death of a Schoolboy'', for the BBC London, and ''The Petersburg-Cannes Express''.

From 2000 to 2006 he also found time to run ''Literary Discord'', a radio program broadcast by WPKN Bridgeport, dedicated to discussing such literature and the state of publishing in the United States. He interviewed, among many others, Russel Banks and Sadi Ranson about the state of publishing in the United States.
