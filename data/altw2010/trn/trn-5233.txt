'''''Midtown Madness 2''''' is a free roam racing/arcade sequel to Midtown Madness series, developed by Angel Studios (now Rockstar San Diego) and published by Microsoft Game Studios, which features a range of vehicles which can be driven around London and San Francisco.

==Race modes==
The game features ''Blitz'', ''Checkpoint'', ''Circuit'' and ''Cruise'' modes, which are all derived from the original Midtown Madness game. Winning Blitz, Checkpoint and Circuit races allows you to unlock new vehicles and paint jobs. The Cruise mode lets you roam freely around the two available cities.

A ''Crash Course'' can be completed in each of the cities. The ''Cab Driving School'' in London Cab driver, where a player must complete objectives in a London cab. The ''Stunt Driver'' course in Ford Mustang Fastback.

Players can change variables which affect the vehicle's performance and visual appearance of the game before starting a race, such as the weather and time of day. Additionally, police vehicle frequency can be modified, as with the amount of traffic and pedestrians.

Every race or cruise would begin with someone commenting about the weather, the conditions of the race, or something else. These commenters would also be heard at the end of a race (not a cruise) saying something that depends on your position upon finishing. The commenters would be different for each race, and they are different for each city (i.e. someone commenting in San Francisco would not be heard in London, or vice versa). These include for San Francisco: a newscaster, a Scottish man, an English woman, and (presumably through her elegant-sounding voice) Queen Elizabeth II, although the woman mispronounces English words using the American slang terms instead.

==Available cities==
London and San Francisco are available as free roaming, yet dimensionally limited, city locales in the game. They represent the innermost areas of the real life cities, although are less detailed than their real life counterparts.<ref>[http://www.mm2c.com/features/londonarticle/ Midtown Madness 2 Central | Midtown Madness 2 | Features | London Through The Eyes Of An Englishman<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===London===
Drivers in tube line. Also you can drive through the Tower of London and jump over the open Tower Bridge.

===San Francisco===
Drivers in San Francisco can also explore landmarks, such as crossing the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. However the route to Marin County does not exist in the game, as the road after the bridge terminates in a loop. Alcatraz is also completely visible, although cannot be reached without further modification. It is also possible, though difficult, to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge.
