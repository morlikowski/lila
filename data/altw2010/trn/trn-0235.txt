 is a Prime Minister of Japan from 2001 to 2006.

Widely seen as a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), he became known as an economic reformer, focusing on Japan's government debt and the privatization of its postal service. In 2005, Koizumi led the LDP to win one of the largest parliamentary majorities in modern Japanese history.

Koizumi also attracted international attention through his deployment of the China and South Korea.

==Early life==
Koizumi is a third-generation politician. His father, Junya Koizumi, was director general of the Japan Defense Agency and a member of the Diet. His grandfather, Matajiro Koizumi, was Minister of Posts and Telecommunications under Prime Ministers Hamaguchi and Wakatsuki and an early advocate of postal privatization. See Koizumi family.

Born in Yokosuka, Kanagawa prefecture on January 8, 1942, Koizumi was educated at Yokosuka High School and Keio University, where he studied economics. He attended University College London before returning to Japan in August 1969 upon the death of his father. He stood for election to the lower house in December; however, he did not earn enough votes to win election as a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) representative. In 1970, he was hired as a secretary to Takeo Fukuda, who was Minister of Finance at the time and would go on to become Prime Minister in 1976.

In the general elections of December 1972, Koizumi was elected as a member of the Lower House for the 11th District of Kanagawa Prefecture. He joined Fukuda's faction within the LDP. Since then, he has been re-elected ten times.

==Member of House of Representatives==
Koizumi gained his first senior post in 1979 as Parliamentary Vice Minister of Finance, and his first ministerial post in 1988 as Minister of Health and Welfare under Prime Minister Miyazawa cabinet) and 1996–1998 (Minister of Health and Welfare in the Uno and Hashimoto cabinets).

In 1994, with the LDP in opposition, Koizumi became part of a new LDP faction, Koichi Kato and Koizumi, a group popularly dubbed "YKK." He competed for the presidency of the LDP in September 1995 and July 1998, but he gained little support losing decisively to vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori in 2000, Koizumi became the last remaining credible member of the YKK trio, which gave him leverage over the reform-minded wing of the party.

On April 24, 2001, Koizumi was elected president of the LDP. He was initially considered an outside candidate against Hashimoto, who was running for his second term as Prime Minister. However, in the first poll of prefectural party organizations, Koizumi won 87 to 11 percent; in the second vote of Diet members, Koizumi won 51 to 40 percent. He defeated Hashimoto by a final tally of 298 to 155 votes.<ref name="anderson">Anderson, Gregory E., "[http://www.asianperspective.org/articles/v28n1-g.pdf Lionheart or Paper Tiger?

===Domestic policy===
Within Japan, Koizumi pushed for new ways to revitalise the moribund economy, aiming to act against bad debts with commercial banks, privatize the postal savings system, and reorganise the factional structure of the LDP. He spoke of the need for a period of painful restructuring in order to improve the future.

In the fall of 2002, Koizumi appointed Keio University economist and frequent television commentator Financial Services Agency (FSA) to fix the country's banking crisis. Bad debts of banks were dramatically cut with the NPL ratio of major banks approaching half the level of 2001. The Japanese economy has been through a slow but steady recovery, and the stock market has dramatically rebounded. The GDP growth for 2004 was one of the highest among G7 nations, according to the IMF and OECD. Takenaka was appointed as a Postal Reform Minister in 2004 for the privatization of Japan Post, operator of the country's Postal Savings system.

Koizumi moved the LDP away from its traditional rural agrarian base toward a more urban, neoliberal core, as Japan's population grew in major cities and declined in less populated areas, although under current purely geographical districting, rural votes in Japan are still many times more powerful than urban ones. In addition to the privatization of Japan Post (which many rural residents fear will reduce their access to basic services such as banking), Koizumi also slowed down the LDP's heavy subsidies for infrastructure and industrial development in rural areas. These tensions made Koizumi a controversial but popular figure within his own party and among the Japanese electorate.

===Foreign policy===

Although Koizumi's foreign policy was focused on closer relations with the United States and UN-centered diplomacy, which were adopted by all of his predecessors, he went further to pursue supporting the US policies in the abductions and nuclear development issues, he took more assertive attitudes than his predecessors <ref>"[http://www8.cao.go.jp/survey/tokubetu/h18/h18-jieitai.pdf]"'「自衛隊のイラク人道復興支援活動に関する特別世論調査」の概要', Cabinet Office of Japan</ref>.

====Self-Defense Forces policy====
Although Koizumi did not initially campaign on the issue of defense reform<ref name="anderson" />, he approved the expansion of the dispatched to Iraq. Koizumi's government also introduced a bill to upgrade the Ministry of Defense in January 9, 2007.<ref name="june06">"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20060617a7.html Diet closes for summer, puts lid on Koizumi legacy]," ''Japan Times'' (registration required), June 17, 2006.</ref>

====Visits to Yasukuni Shrine====
Koizumi has often been noted for his controversial visits to the China and South Korea, and, indeed, many from within Japan itself. These countries still hold bitter memories of Japanese invasion and occupation during the first half of the 20th century. As a result, China and South Korea refused to meet Koizumi in Japan and their countries, and there were no mutual visits between Chinese and Japanese leaders from October 2001, and between South Korean and Japanese leaders from June 2005. The standstill ended when the next prime minister Abe visited China and South Korea in October 2006.

In China, the visits led to massive anti-Japanese riots. The president, ruling and opposition parties, and much of the media of South Korea openly condemned the visits regardless of their political positions. <ref>

When Koizumi was asked about such speeches, Koizumi stated these are "for the domestic (audience)". 

Although Koizumi signed the shrine's visitor book as "Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister of Japan", he claimed that his visits to the shrine were as a private citizen and not an endorsement of any political stance.<ref>"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20060126a1.htm Koizumi not backing down on Yasukuni]," ''The Japan Times'' (registration required), January 26, 2006.</ref> These claims were scoffed as ineffective excuses in China and Korea. Several journals and news reports in Japan, such as one published by Kyodo News Agency on August 15, 2006, questioned the validity of the claim that Koizumi was visiting as a private citizen, as he recorded his name on the shrine's guestbook as prime minister, and visited the shrine yearly as part of his campaign pledge, which was political in nature.

Koizumi revisited the shrine again in August 15, 2007, after having resigned as prime minister, to mark the 62nd anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War Two. However, his 2007 visit was met with less attention from the media than on prior occasions.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/photo/070815/ids_photos_wl/r1219897673.jpg Yahoo news]</ref><ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=aobKKW2KinWU Former Japanese PM Koizumi Visits War Shrine in Tokyo (Update4)]</ref>

====Statements on World War II====
On August 15, 2005, the sixtieth anniversary of the end of World War II, Koizumi publicly stated that Japan was deeply saddened by the suffering it caused during World War II and vowed Japan would never again take "the path to war". [http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/pacific.victoryday/] However, Koizumi was criticized for actions which allegedly ran contrary to this expression of remorse (e.g. the Yasukuni visits), which resulted in worsening relations with China and South Korea.

Initially Koizumi was at certain points in his tenure an extremely popular leader, with his outspoken nature and colourful past. His nicknames included "Lionheart", due to his hair style and fierce spirit, and "Maverick".<ref name="anderson" /> During his tenure in office, it was common for the Japanese public to refer to him as "Jun-chan". In June 2001, he enjoyed an approval rating of 85 percent, with only 7 percent disapproving.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/BUSINESS/asia/06/11/japan.popularity/index.html Koizumi's popularity hits fresh peak], CNN.com, June 12 2001.</ref>

In January 2002, he sacked his popular but volatile Foreign Minister Koichi Kato, Koizumi's popularity rating had fallen 40 percentage points since his nomination as prime minister.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1916438.stm Koizumi ally quits politics over scandal]," BBC News, April 8 2002.</ref>

Koizumi was re-elected in 2003 and his popularity surged as the economy recovered. His proposal to cut pension benefits as a move to fiscal reform, however, turned out to be highly unpopular. Also, his two visits to House of Councilors elections in 2004 to being only marginally better than the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).

In 2005, the House of Councilors rejected the contentious postal privatization bills. Koizumi previously made it clear that he would dissolve the lower house if the bill failed to pass. The Democratic Party, while expressing support for the privatization, made a tactical vote against the bill. Fifty-one LDP members also either voted against the bills or abstained.

On New Komeito (a junior coalition partner with Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party) said that his party would entertain forming a coalition government with the Democratic Party of Japan if the DPJ took a majority in the House of Representatives.<ref>"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20050728a2.htm New Komeito exec signals willingness to jump LDP ship]," ''The Japan Times'' (registration required), July 28, 2005.</ref>
