==History==
Uroševac was little more than a village until Saint Uroš, who is commemorated by a cathedral in the town. Its Albanian name derives from a pre-1873 hotel owned by a local Kosovo Albanian named Turkish. It is still known informally as "Tasjan", from a Turkish form of the French word ''station'', referring to its status as a main station on the railway line.<ref name="elsie">Robert Elsie. "Ferizaj", ''Historical Dictionary of Kosova'', p. 58. Scarecrow Press, 2004. ISBN 0810853094</ref>

The city suffered some damage during the Yugoslav Army. Following the war, the city has seen serious intercommunal unrest which resulted in almost all of the non-Albanian inhabitants being expelled or fleeing. 

KFOR peacekeeping force in Kosovo, is located nearby.

==Mosque and Church==
