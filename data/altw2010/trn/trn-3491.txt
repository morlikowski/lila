'''Fort Necessity National Battlefield''', located near Congress in 1932, the park consists of three separate sections totaling about 900 acres (4 km²). Here, French colonial expansion. What became known as the British and French colonial interests in North America, and in doing so helped cause the worldwide conflict known as the Seven Years' War. It is also the location of George Washington's only military surrender. Along with the fort and battlefield, the park also contains an historic tavern from the early days of the National Road and the grave of British military commander Edward Braddock.

==Fort design and construction==
Built in an open clearing surrounded by dense hardwood forest, the fort was a circular palisade constructed primarily of white oak. Crude and simplistic, the fort centerpiece was a 10 by 14 foot (3 by 4 m) log cabin. The roof on the shelter was covered with animal skin for protection against the weather. The cabin was surrounded by a 7 to 8 foot (2 to 2.5 m) tall palisade fence that was 53 feet (16 m) in diameter. Earthworks were built outside the main stockade in a diamond shape. The fortification was built between two streams. The entire project took the men five days to complete.

==History==

After the failed attempt to build and secure a fort at the "Forks of the Ohio" (present day location of Pittsburgh) in January 1754, colonial Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia sent 22 year old Lt. Colonel George Washington to build a roadway through the forest (toward the Monangahela River)that would allow greater numbers of troops and equipment to enter the region. While constructing the road in May 1754, Washington and his party scouted out an area which was known as the great meadows and decided that this would be a good choice for an encampment. Told by Indian guides that an advance party of French soldiers was nearby, Washington and approximately 40 of the colonials set out to locate them. On the morning of  May 28, 1754, Washington's party encountered a small group of French troops, under the leadership of Joseph Coulon de Villiers, Sieur de Jumonville. In the Battle of Jumonville Glen, 10 French soldiers were killed and 21, including Jumonville, who was wounded, were captured. It has never been determined who initiated the first shots, but what has become known as the Jumonville affair has been credited as the commencement of the French and Indian War, or as it is known in Europe, the Seven Years' War.

After returning to the great meadows, Washington decided it prudent to reinforce his position. Supposedly named by Washington as Fort Necessity or Fort of Necessity, The constructed a storehouse to store supplies such as gunpowder, rum, and flour. The crude palisade they erected was built to defend supplies in the fort's storehouse from Washington's own men who he described as loose and idle. By June 12, 1754, Washington had under his command 293 colonials and nominal command of 100 additional regular British army troops from South Carolina. Washington spent the remainder of June 1754 extending the wilderness road further towards his destination for an advanced base which was Redstone Old Fort on the Monongahela River.

On July 3, 1754, in the Battle of the Great Meadows, 600 French troops led by Capt. Louis Coulon de Villiers, the brother of Jumonville, along with 100 Indians, attacked the fort. Throughout the day, heavy rain swamped the low-lying fort making the use of firearms difficult and ruining much of the gunpowder and provisions.  The French however also had problems.  They were nearly out of supplies after having to travel light to catch Washington.  Furthermore, French estimates put the numbers of their force only at 300 Indians and 100 French.  To make things worse, those Indians wanted to leave the next morning. 
Late in the day, Washington did not know the French situation. Feeling that their position was untenable, Washington accepted surrender terms which allowed the peaceful withdrawal of his forces which he completed on July 4, 1754<ref>Leckie, 276</ref>. The French subsequently occupied the fort and then burned it.

==Park Formation and Structure==
Attempts to preserve the location of Fort Necessity were undertaken and on Congress declared the location a National Battlefield Site under management of the War Department. Transferred to the archaeological research helped to uncover the majority of the original fort position, shape and design. A replica of the fort was completed in the 1970s. A new visitor center, which also is home to a National Road interpretive center opened on October 8, 2005. The battlefield and fort are currently being improved, with a the fort replica being reconstructed to look more historically accurate, new informative signs being added, and the historic treelines and charge locations being outlined.

Along with the fort, the national battlefield also features two other historic sites. On a hillside adjacent to the battlefield and within the boundaries of the park is Mount Washington Tavern, a classic example of the many inns lining the National Road, America's first federally-funded highway. The land on which the tavern was built was originally owned by George Washington, who purchased the site on which he commanded his first battle just a few months before his death in 1799. In 1827, Judge Nathnial Ewing of Uniontown constructed the tavern. James Sampey acquired the land and constructed an inn along the new highway.  It was operated by his family until the railroad construction boom caused the National Road to decline in popularity, rendering the inn unprofitable.  In 1855, it was sold to the Fazenbakers and served as a private home for the next 75 years, until it was acquired by the National Park Service in 1933 and restored. The Mount Washington Tavern demonstrates the standard features of an early American tavern, including a simple but congenial barroom that served as a gathering place, a more fancy parlor room that was used for relaxation, and crowded bedrooms in which people would crowd in order to catch up on sleep.
