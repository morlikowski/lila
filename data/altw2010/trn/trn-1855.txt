'''Turks e Caicos''' è un territorio d'oltremare del Regno Unito. È formata dalle isole di Gran Turk e di Salt Cay, più altre ventotto isole minori. 

== Politica ==
L'isola di Grand Turk è il centro amministrativo, politico e culturale delle '''Turks e Caicos'''; in cui si trova Cockburn Town, capitale amministrativa e politica dal 1766, sede del governo. Le isole erano sotto la giurisdizione della Giamaica fino al 1962, quando assunsero lo status di colonia della corona. Il governatore delle Bahamas si curò degli affari delle isole dal 1965 al 1973, quando le Bahamas ottennero l'indipendenza. '''Turks e Caicos''' ricevette quindi un governo separato e nel 1982 divenne un territorio d'oltremare.
Il 30 agosto 1975 (festa nazionale) le isole si dotarono di una costituzione. Sospesa nel 1986, fu riveduta e ristabilita il 5 maggio di due anni dopo.
Il sistema legale di '''Turks e Caicos''' è basato sul Common Law inglese, con un numero minore di leggi adottate da Giamaica e Bahamas.

Il sovrano del Regno Unito è il capo dello stato rappresentato da un governatore. Il capo del governo è il primo ministro. Il Consiglio Esecutivo è formato da tre membri ''ex officio''e cinque scelti dal governatore tra i membri del Consiglio Legislativo. Non ci sono elezioni: il governatore è scelto dal sovrano e il primo ministro è scelto dal governatore.

Il Consiglio Legislativo è composto da 19 membri, di cui 13 eletti dai cittadini per 4 anni. Attualmente il Partito Nazionale Progressista (PNP) di Michael Misick detiene 8 seggi e il Movimento Democratico Popolare (PDM) di Derek H. Taylor i restanti tre. Il Partito Democratico Unito (UDP) di Wendal Swann non ha nessun seggio.

Il più alto organo giuridico è la Corte Suprema.

== Demografia ==

Otto delle trenta isole dell'arcipelago sono disabitate, con una popolazione totale (Luglio 2006) di circa 32000 abitanti. Un terzo della popolazione ha meno di 15 anni, e solo il 6% supera i 65 anni. Nel 2006 la popolazione cresceva con un tasso di 2.82% anno, con 10.57 immigrati ogni mille abitanti, 21.84 nascite per 1000 abitanti e 4.21 morti per 1000 abitanti. La mortalità infantile è di 15.18 morti ogni 1000 nati e l'aspettativa di vita era di 74.73 anni (72.48 per gli uomini, 77.08 per le donne). La maggioranza della popolazione è nera. Per 2/5 battisti, per 1/5 metodisti e per 1/5 anglicani. Meno del 2% sono avventisti del 7° giorno.

== Storia ==

== Economia ==

L'economia di '''Turks e Caicos''' è basata su turismo, pesca e servizi finanziari offshore. Gran parte delle merci per uso interno è importato. Gli Stati Uniti ed il Canada sono i paesi di provenienza della maggioranza dei turisti. La maggiore fonte di guadagno dello stato sono le imposte sulle attività finanziarie. Il PIL era di 216 milioni di $ (11500$ per abitante) nel 2002, con un tasso di crescita del 4.9% e l'inflazione al 4%. Un terzo della forza lavoro è occupata in posizioni governative, un quinto nel settore primario, il resto nel terzo settore. Il tasso di disoccupazione si aggira intorno al 10%. La bilancia commerciale vede un entrata di 47 milioni di $ a fronte di una spesa di 33.5 milioni di $. 

I principali prodotti agricoli sono Stati Uniti.

== Comunicazioni ==

Le isole producono  e consumano circa 5GWh di elettricità, la quasi totalità prodotta da combustibili fossili. Il territorio dispone di circa 5700 linee telefoniche (2002) e 1700 cellualri (1999). Il sistema è connesso con la terra tramite due cavi sottomarini ed i satelliti Intelsat. Sull'isola sono attive 2 stazioni radio AM e 7 FM, ricevute dalle circa 8000 radio disponibili sulle isole. Attiva è solo un canale televisivo (WIV TV), ma è possibile ricevere trasmissioni via cavo dalle Bahamas. Il territorio ha due Internet Provider che si occupano dei 1488 (2005) host. Il dominio internet è .tc

The '''Turks and Caicos Islands''' ('''TCI''') () are a British Overseas Territory consisting of two groups of tropical islands in the West Indies at .

==History==

The islands of the Turks and Caicos were first populated by Carib Amerindians.
 
Though many nations controlled the islands, official settlement did not occur right away. For several decades around the turn of the 18th century they became popular Bermudian salt collectors were the first to settle the Turk Islands in 1678 or 1681. In 1765–1783 they were under French occupation. After the British Caribbean colonies, including (in 1783) the first settlers on the Caicos Islands; cotton became an important crop briefly. In 1799 both island groups were annexed by Britain as part of the Bahamas.

There was a great deal of political turmoil surrounding the ownership of the Turks and Caicos even within the British empire: Bermuda had been in effective possession of them for a century, though, under British law they were the common wealth of all British citizens. Spanish and French forces seized the Turks in 1706, but Bermudian forces expelled them four years later in what was probably Bermuda's only independent military operation. For many years, the Bahamas (itself originally settled by Bermudian puritans in 1647) and Bermuda fought for control of the archipelago. The struggle began in 1766, when the King's representative in the Bahamas, Mr Symmer, on his own authority, wrote a constitution which legislated for and taxed the Bermudians on the Turks. The Secretary of State, Lord Hillsborough, for the Crown, issued orders that the Bermudian activities on the Turks should not be obstructed or restrained in any way. As a result of this order, Symmer's constitution was dissolved. The Bermudians on the Turks appointed commissioners to govern themselves, with the assent of the King's local agent. They drew up regulations for good government, but the Bahamian governor Shirley drew up his own regulations for the Turks and ordered that no one might work at salt raking who had not signed assent to his regulations. Following this, a raker was arrested and the salt pans were seized and divided by force. The Bahamas government attempted to appoint judicial authorities for the Turks in 1768, but these were refused by the Bermudians.

In 1773 the Bahamian government passed an act attempting to tax the salt produced in the Turks, but the Bermudians refused to pay it. In 1774, the Bahamians passed another, similar act, and this they submitted for the Crown's assent. The Crown passed this act on to the Bermudian government which objected to it, and which rejected Bahamian jurisdiction over the Turks. The Crown, as a consequence, refused assent of the Act as applied to include the Turks, and, in the form in which it finally passed, the Bahamas, but not the Turks, were included. The Bermudians on the Turks continued to be governed under their own regulations, with the assent of the royal agent, until 1780, when a more formal version of those regulations was submitted for the assent of the Crown, which was given. Those regulations, issued as a royal order, stated that all British subjects had the right ("free liberty") to rake and gather salt on the Turks, providing that they conformed to the regulations, which expressly rejected Bahamian jurisdiction over the Turks. Despite this refutation by a higher authority of their right to impinge upon Bermudian activities on the Turks, the Bahamian government continued to harass the Bermudians (unsurprisingly, given the lucrativeness of the Turks salt trade). Although the salt industry on the Turks had largely been a Bermudian preserve, it had been seen throughout the 17th century as the right of all British subjects to rake there, and small numbers of Bahamians had been involved.

In 1783, the French had landed a force on Grand Turk which a British force of 100 men, under then-Captain Horatio Nelson, had been unable to dislodge, but which was soon withdrawn. Following this, the Bahamians were slow to return to the Turks, while the Bermudians quickly resumed salt production, sending sixty to seventy-five ships to the Turks each year, during the six months that salt could be raked. Nearly a thousand Bermudians spent part of the year on the Turks engaged in salt production, and the industry became more productive. The Bahamas, meanwhile, was incurring considerable expense in absorbing loyalist refugees from the now-independent American colonies, and returned to the idea of taxing Turks salt for the needed funds. The Bahamian government ordered that all ships bound for the Turk Islands obtain a license at Nassau first. The Bermudians refused to do this. Following this, Bahamian authorities seized the Bermuda sloops ''Friendship'' and ''Fanny'' in 1786. Shortly after, three Bermudian vessels were seized at Grand Caicos, with $35,000 worth of goods salvaged from a French ship. French privateers were becoming a menace to Bermudian operations in the area, at the time, but the Bahamians were their primary concern.  The Bahamian government re-introduced a tax on salt from the Turks, annexed them to the Bahamas, and created a seat in the Bahamian parliament to represent them. The Bermudians refused these efforts also, but the continual pressure from the Bahamaians had a negative effect on the salt industry.

In 1806, the Bermudian customs authorities went some way toward acknowledging the Bahamian annexation when it ceased to allow free exchange between the Turks and Bermuda (this affected many enslaved Bermudians, who, like the free ones, had occupied the Turks only seasonally, returning to their homes in Bermuda after the year's raking had finished). That same year, French privateers attacked the Turks, burning ships and absconding with a large sloop. The Bahamians refused to help, and the Admiralty in Jamaica claimed the Turks were beyond its jurisdiction. Two hurricanes, the first in August, 1813, the second in October, 1815, destroyed more than two-hundred buildings, significant salt stores, and sank many vessels.  By 1815, the United States, the primary client for Turks salt, had been at war with Britain (and hence Bermuda) for three years, and had established other sources of salt. With the destruction wrought by the storm, and the loss of market, many Bermudians abandoned the Turks, and those remaining were so distraught that they welcomed the visit of the Bahamian governor in 1819. The British government eventually assigned political control to the Bahamas, which the Turks and Caicos remained a part of until the 1840s.

In 1848 they were declared a separate colony under a Council President. The last incumbent was maintained in 1873 when the islands were made part of Jamaica colony; in 1894 the chief colonial official was restyled Commissioner. In 1917, Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden suggested that the Turks and Caicos join Canada, but this suggestion was shot down by British prime minister Lloyd George.

On 4 July 1959 they were again a separate colony (Turks and Caicos), the last Commissioner being restyled Administrator, but until 31 May 1962 they were one of the constitutive parts of the Federation of the West Indies (see Trinidad and Tobago). By 1973 they had gained independence and their own governor (the last Administrator was restyled). In 1974 Canadian New Democratic Party Leader Max Saltsman tried to use his Private Member's Bill to create legislation to annex the islands to Canada, but it didn't pass in the Canadian House of Commons. They have had their own government head by a Chief minister since August 1976. In 1979 independence was agreed upon in principle for 1982, but a change in government caused a policy reversal, and they instead approached the Canadian Government to discuss a possible union, but at the time the Canadian Government was embroiled in a debate over free trade with the U.S., and little attention was paid to the suggestion. Their political troubles in recent years have resulted in a rewritten constitution. The Canadian Government still shows an interest in annexing the islands however, and in 2004 a Canadian Conservative Party MP travelled to the Turks and Caicos to explore the possibility. He drafted a motion asking the Canadian Government to look into the issue, but his party declined, citing immigration, tourism, and economic issues. However, the Canadian government does not dismiss the possibility of a future union. In 2004 the Provincial Legislature of Nova Scotia passed a motion inviting the Turks and Caicos to join that province in the event of a future union, which is hoped for by many sun-loving Nova Scotians.

The two island groups are in the North Atlantic Ocean, southeast of the geographically contiguous to the politically a separate entity. The Caicos Islands are separated by the Caicos Passage from the closest Bahamian islands, Mayaguana and Great Inagua.

The eight main islands and more than 20 smaller islands have a total land area of , primarily of low, flat limestone with extensive marshes and mangrove swamps and  of beach front. The weather is usually sunny and relatively dry, but suffers frequent hurricanes. The islands have limited natural fresh water resources; private cisterns collect rainwater for drinking. The primary natural resources are spiny lobster, conch and other shellfish. The United Nations Committee on Decolonisation includes the Turks and Caicos Islands on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.

The two distinct island groups are separated by the Turks Passage.

===Caicos Islands===
thumb|right|A view of [[Cockburn Town]]

The Caicos Islands are the larger group, with almost 96 percent of the land area (589.5&nbsp;km²) and 82 percent of the population (26,584 out of a total of 33,302 in 2006). The spatial arrangement of the islands around the large Caicos Bank (with an area of 7,680 km² [http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-100/html/sts100-708-078.html]) resembles an districts of the territory. Four of the six main islands are inhabited, plus two of the smaller islands:

Main islands, from West to East, with population estimates of 2006:
*West Caicos (uninhabited since the early 1900s)
*Providenciales (main urban centre, with most of the population: 22 542)
*North Caicos (population 1 895)
*Middle Caicos (population 468)
*East Caicos (uninhabited since the early 1900s)
*South Caicos (population 1 579)
*Ambergris Cay (uninhabited up until 1997)

Inhabited smaller islands, in the Caicos Cays between Providenciales and North Caicos:
*Pine Cay (tourist resort, population 30)
*Parrot Cay (tourist resort, population 100)

The Caicos Islands make up four of the six districts of the territory.

===Turks Islands===

right|thumb|Satellite Image of Salt Cay (lower left) and neighboring islets
The Turks Islands, separated from the Caicos Islands by Turks Island Passage (more than 2,200 m deep), are a chain that stretches north-south. The total area is , with an estimated population of 5,753. There are two main islands, which are the only inhabited ones of the group:

*Grand Turk (with the capital of the territory, population 5 567)
*Salt Cay (population 186)

Together with nearby islands, all on Turks Bank, those two main islands form the two of the six administrative districts of the territory that fall within the Turks Islands. Turks Bank has a total area of about 450 km².

===Mouchoir Bank===
 east of the Turks Islands and separated from them by Mouchoir Passage, is Mouchoir Bank. Although it is submerged with a least depth of , and has no emergent cays or islets, it is part of the Turks and Caicos Islands and falls within its EEZ. Mouchoir Bank measures 960 km² in area. Two banks further east, Silver Bank and Navidad Bank, are geographically a continuation, but belong politically to the Dominican Republic

==Climate==
The Turks and Caicos Islands are arid compared to many other islands in the Caribbean. In the winter the weather is generally in the 20-25 degrees Celcius range. The temperatures easily climb to 30 degrees Celcius during the summer. The island gets less than 130 cm of rainfall per year. Most rainfall occurs during the hurricane months of summer. Sunshine and breezy cooling winds are the norm in the Turks and Caicos Islands.

==Politics==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->

Grand Turk is the administrative and political capital of the Turks and Caicos Islands and Cockburn Town has been the seat of government since 1766. The islands were under English English is the official language.

As a British territory, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom is the sovereign, represented by a governor. The head of government is the premier. The cabinet consists of three ''ex officio'' members and five appointed by the governor from among the members of the House of Assembly. The monarch is hereditary, the governor is appointed by the monarch, and the premier appointed by the governor.

The unicameral House of Assembly consists of 19 seats, of which 15 are popularly elected; members serve four-year terms. Elections were held in 2003 and again on February 9th 2007. The Progressive National Party, led by Hon. Michael Misick holds thirteen seats, and the People's Democratic Movement, led by Floyd Seymour, holds two seats.

The judicial branch of government is headed by a Supreme Court and appeals are heard by the court of appeals and final appeals by the privy council of the UK.

Turks and Caicos participates in the Caribbean Development Bank, is an associate in CARICOM, and maintains an Interpol sub-bureau. Defence is the responsibility of the United Kingdom. In December of 2004 the Turks and Caicos Islands sought to become a new associate member to the Association of Caribbean States [http://www.caribbeaninvestor.com/article.shtml?browser_query=varticle&field=3864 article].

==Demographics==
Eight of the thirty islands in the territory are inhabited, with a total population in mid-2006 of about 32,000. One-third of the population is under 15 years old, and only 4% are 65 or older. In 2000 the population was growing at a rate of 3.55% per year, with 14.46 migrants per 1,000 population and 25.65 births per 1,000 population, offset by 4.57 deaths per 1,000 population. The infant mortality rate was 18.66 deaths per 1,000 live births and the life expectancy at birth was 73.28 years (71.15 years for males, 75.51 years for females). The total fertility rate was 3.25 children born per woman. The annual population growth rate is 2.82%.
 
Ethnically, the vast majority of inhabitants are black and Seventh-day Adventist.

==Economy==
The economy of the Turks and Caicos Islands is based on tourism, fishing, and offshore financial services.  Most capital goods and food for domestic consumption are imported.  The United States was the leading source of tourists in 1996, accounting for more than half of the 87,000 visitors; another major source of tourists is Canada. Tourist arrivals had risen to approximately 200,000 in 2006.

The government is pursuing a two-prong strategy to increase tourism. Upscale resorts are aimed at the wealthy, while a large new cruise ship port and recreation centre has been built for the masses visiting Grand Turk.

Major sources of government revenue include fees from offshore financial activities and customs receipts. The territory's gross domestic product as of late 2006 is approximately $400 million (per capita $12 500), with a real growth rate of about 4,9% (2000) and an inflation rate of about 4%. The labour force totalled 12000 workers in 2006. The labour force distribution is as follows:

| Skilled || 20%
|-
| Semi-Skilled || 12%

|}

The British Pounds. Most commemorative coin issues are denominated in crowns.

The primary agricultural products include limited amounts of maize, beans, cassava (tapioca) and citrus fruits. Fish and conch are the only significant export, with some $169.2 million of lobster, dried and fresh conch, and conch shells exported in 2000, primarily to the United States and the United Kingdom. In recent years, however, the catch has been declining. The territory used to be an important trans-shipment point for South American narcotics destined for the United States, but due to the ongoing pressure of a combined American, Bahamian and Turks and Caicos effort has this trade been greatly reduced.

The islands import food and beverages, tobacco, clothing, manufactures and construction materials, primarily from the United States and the United Kingdom. Imports totalled $175.6 million in 2000.

The islands produce and consume about 5 GWh of electricity, all from fossil fuel.

==Communications and Media==
The territory had about 3000 telephone lines in use in 1994. Currently, mobile phone service is provided by TDMA and Digicel using GSM 900 and 1900. CDMA phones will not work on the island. The system is connected to the mainland by two submarine cables and an Intelsat earth station. There were three AM radio stations (one inactive) and six FM stations (no shortwave) in 1998. Over 8000 radio receivers are owned across the territory.

West Indies Video (WIV) has been the sole Cable Television provider for the Turks and Caicos Islands for over two decades and WIV4 (a subsidiary of WIV) has been the only broadcast station in the islands for over 15 years; broadcasts from the country code top level domain (ccTLD) is ".TC". Amateur radio callsigns begin with "VP5" and visiting operators frequently work from the islands.
