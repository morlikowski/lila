'''Tampere''' (svensk ''Tammerfors'') er med 204.385 indbyggere (2006) den trediestørste by i Finland, og den største indlandsby i Norden.

Byen blev grundlagt af Gustav 3. af Sverige i 1779 ved fossen ''Tammerkoski'' mellem søerne ''Näsijärvi'' og ''Pyhäjärvi'', hvor der blev etableret en dæmning. Udnyttelse af vandkraft gjorde det muligt at opbygge en industrisamfund her allerede i 1800-tallet, og netop vandkraften har i høj grad været en medvirkende årsag til, at Tampere også i moderne tid er en betydelig industriby. Byens mange væverier og maskinfabrikker har været med til at give byen tilnavnet "Finlands Manchester".

I dag er byen også et betydningsfuld uddannelsesmæssigt center med flere universiteter.

Blandt Tamperes seværdigheder findes ikke mindst Tampere Kunstmuseum med Mumidalen og den model af mumi-huset som Tove Jansson og hendes venner byggede, og en lang række skitser, manuskripter med mere, som danner grundlag for den meget store børne-TV succes Mumitroldene.
