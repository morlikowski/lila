'''Michael Schenker''' (born German heavy metal UFO and a founding member of Scorpions and the Michael Schenker Group (M.S.G). He is the younger brother of Rudolf Schenker, who is still a guitarist with Scorpions. 

==Career==
Born in rock guitarists working today. He started playing in his early teens when his brother Rudolf brought home a Flying V guitar, which captured Michael's imagination. Schenker debuted with Scorpions on their debut album Lonesome Crow at age 16 and was lauded at the time for his mature technique.

Schenker joined UFO under unusual circumstances. The band, UFO, left the UK to play some dates in Germany. Their guitarist at the time, Bernie Marsden, forgot his passport and was unable to make the first gig. At the venue members of UFO spotted Michael playing a soundcheck with the Scorpions and managed to persuade him into playing that evening's show.

Shortly thereafter, Schenker was offered the lead guitar spot in UFO and with the blessing of his brother Rudolf, accepted it.  At first, communication between Schenker and the rest of the band was difficult because  he spoke virtually no English, instead relying on his girlfriend as an interpreter.  Schenker has since become fluent in English.

Schenker wrote the music for most of UFO's major label (Chrysalis) debut album ''Phenomenon''. His playing on this and subsequent UFO albums attracted attention from music critics and especially from the guitar community.  Schenker's melodic style and clear, articulate playing were rooted in the approach of Hank Marvin who with his band the Shadows, was influential in establishing the electric guitar as a lead instrument. Also evident in Schenker's playing is the familiar and fundamental blues-based hard rock framework established by players like Jimmy Page, Leslie West, and Jeff Beck. 

Schenker had a turbulent career with UFO, often walking out mid-song and causing shows to be canceled. Despite having a series of successful albums and tours, Schenker finally left UFO in October 1978 (last show in Palo Alto, California).

Schenker re-joined the Scorpions in late 1978, when they were recording the album ''Lovedrive'', thus resulting in his contribution of lead guitar on 3 songs ("Another Piece Of Meat", "Coast To Coast" and "Lovedrive"). In 1979, Schenker toured with the band in support for the album but 3 months later, after numerous occasions on which he could not perform on stage (due to fatigue and alcohol problems), he finally left the band and was permanently replaced by Matthias Jabs (who originally joined the Scorpions before Schenker's return, and recorded the rest of the lead guitars apart from the three pieces which Michael played.)

Schenker auditioned for Aerosmith (detailed in their biography ''Walk This Way'') and Ozzy Osbourne. Osbourne said in a 1982 ''Hit Parader'' interview that he did contact Schenker following the death of Randy Rhoads:

''It so happens I did contact Michael Schenker, but he wanted a king's ransom before he'd do anything...I don't need that annoyance.''

Schenker decided he wanted to play his own music and not be a hired hand for another band. In 1979, he founded the Michael Schenker Group.

The history of MSG is strewn with personality conflicts and incidents between band members. In 1982, original vocalist The Michael Schenker Group and Rainbow, Alcatrazz).

Bonnet lasted one album (Assault Attack) and was fired from the band because he often lost his voice during shows, although the actual firing happened after dropping his pants in a warm-up gig in Sheffield before the Reading Festival. Barden was called in at the last minute and did the show with only a few hours rehearsal and opening the appearance with the words: "surprise surprise". Although many fans proclaimed Assault Attack as being MSGs best recording, Barden was enticed back to the band for Reading (documented on the BBC Radio One Live in Concert) and stayed with M.S.G. for the recording of a new studio album (''Built to Destroy'') and the band's second live album (''Rock Will Never Die'').

In 1990 Schenker briefly played guitar for the band Ratt appearing on their MTV Unplugged performance, filling in for a sick Robbin Crosby.

After Barden's second departure, Schenker reorganized the band around himself and new vocalist Robin McAuley as the ''McAuley Schenker Group'' and steered the group to a more commercial hard rock sound. After three albums with the lineup, Schenker and McAuley parted company. 

Schenker rejoined UFO for their reunion album ''Walk on Water''. A short tour, punctuated by a fight between Schenker and vocalist Phil Mogg, ended the reunion.

Schenker then resurrected the The Unforgiven'', ''Written in Sand'' and ''Arachnophobiac''. The group toured yearly around the United States and Europe.

He later rejoined UFO for two further releases, ''Covenant'' and ''Sharks''.
