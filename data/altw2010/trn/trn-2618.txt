==History==
Joseph C. Avery settled a land claim at the mouth of Marys River where it flows into the Willamette River in 1845.<ref name=Oregon>Corning, Howard M. ''Dictionary of Oregon History''. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956.</ref> In 1849, Avery opened a store at the site, platted the land, and surveyed a town site on his land claim, naming the community Marysville.<ref name=Oregon/>
It is possible that the city was named after early settler Mary Lloyd, but now the name is thought to be derived from French fur trappers' naming of a local peak after the Virgin Mary.<ref>[http://www.gazettetimes.com/articles/2007/02/17/news/community/2loc07_munford.txt Corvallis Gazette Times: Archived Articles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
