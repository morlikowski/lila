'''Bön''' eller '''bon''', är en mycket gammal trosinriktning i Tibet, ursprungligen animistisk och schamanistisk, men idag framför allt räknad som en av skolorna inom tibetansk buddhism.

Den traditionella synen på bön har varit att det är den för-buddhistiska (alltså äldre än 700-talet) inhemska schamanistiska och animistiska religionen, som genom att ta vissa yttre buddhistiska attribut lyckats överleva den religiösa förföljelsen från den tibetanska statsmaktens form av buddhism.

Bönlamor, ibland kallade "svartmössor" för att skilja dem från den stora Buddhas.

De flesta håller dock som mer troligt att bön efter tantriska buddhismen som den tolkades av gelug-skolan och smälte samman delar av denna med sina egna förbuddhistiska föreställningar.

Bönskolan, till vilken de kinesiska myndigheterna skattar att ca 10% av tibetanerna hör, framför allt i de östra delarna av det kulturgeografiska området Tibet, delar det mesta av sin tro och utövning med andra buddhister i Tibet, men har också flera särskiljande ritualer och texter.

'''Bön'''<ref>Although the Wylie transcription of the Tibetan spelling is just "bon", the umlaut is conventionally added above the "o" to more nearly suggest the Tibetan pronunciation of the vowel.</ref> () is the oldest spiritual tradition of Tibet. Tenzin Gyatso, the fourteenth Dalai Lama, has recognized the Bön tradition as the fifth principal spiritual school of Tibet, along with the Nyingma, Sakya, Kagyu, and Gelug schools of Buddhism.

The syllable ''-po'' appended to the name of any of the five main Tibetan spiritual traditions indicates a follower of that tradition; so, for example, "Bonpo" means a follower of the Bon tradition.<ref>"Introductory History of the Five Tibetan Traditions of Buddhism and Bon."

Often described as the shamanistic and animistic tradition of the Himalayas prior to Buddhism's rise to prominence in the 7th century, more recent research and disclosures have demonstrated that both the religion and the Bönpo are significantly more rich and textured culturally than was initially thought by pioneering Western scholars.

==History of Bön==
===Foundation===
Traditionally, Tönpa Shenrab Miwoche<!--dates of birth/death and/or era flourished in?--> is believed to have established the Bön religion. He is traditionally held to have been born in the land of nine are of great significance and considered auspicious by the Bönpo as well as Hindus'''

===1700s===
The Dzungars invaded Tibet in 1717, deposed and killed a pretender to the position of Dalai Lama (who had been promoted by Lhabzang, the titular King of Tibet), which met with widespread approval. However, they soon began to loot the holy places of Lhasa which brought a swift response from Emperor Kangxi in 1718, but his military expedition was annihilated by the Dzungars not far from Lhasa.<ref>Richardson, Hugh E.

Many Nyingmapa and Bonpos were executed and Tibetans visiting Dzungar officials were forced to stick their tongues out so the Dzungars could tell if the person recited constant mantras (which was said to make the tongue black or brown). This allowed them to pick the Nyingmapa and Bonpos, who recited many magic-mantras.<ref>Norbu, Namkhai. (1980). "Bon and Bonpos". ''Tibetan Review'', December, 1980, p. 8.</ref> This habit of sticking one's tongue out as a mark of respect on greeting someone has remained a Tibetan custom until recent times.

===1800s===
In the nineteenth century, terma tradition, not irreparable.

According to the Bönpo, eighteen enlightened entities will manifest in this Buddha of this age (compare kalpa). The 33rd lineage holder of Menri Monastery, HH the Menri Trizin Lungtog Tenpei Nyima Rinpoche, and Lopön Tenzin Namdak are important current lineage holders of Bön.

More than three hundred Bön monasteries had been established in Tibet prior to Chinese annexation. Of these, Menri Monastery and Yungdrung Monastery were the two principal monastic universities for the study and practice of the Bön knowledges and science-arts.

===Bon Today===
A complex appreciation of Bön is emerging by scholars. Bön, prior to the Tibetan diaspora, existed within a web of ancient indigenous animism, Hinduism, sympathetic magic, Buddhism, folk religion, shamanism, Vajrayana, asceticism and mysticism; complexes prevalent throughout the Himalaya and intermingling throughout the Inner Asian region. Pegg (2006) relates that these

<blockquote>
"[C]omplexes include mosaics of performing practices and discourses rather than discrete or fixed sets of practices or beliefs. They are syncretic and overlapping. The power of sound to communicate with spirits is recognized…" and a recurrent motif throughout the region.
</blockquote>

==The meaning of Bön==
<!--i've tried to make this more readable, but this paragraph still needs a lot of work-->Among the important aims of Bön are cultivating obscuration of dualism and entrance the Bönpo, and sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya are aligned and in sympathetic resonance.

Pegg (2006) lists the artifacts that have generally been used in the Himalaya:
<blockquote>
"[A] small hand-bell (Tibetan ''dril-bu'', Mongol ''honh'') held in the left hand together with the ritual sceptre (Mongol ''dorje'') in the right; thigh-bone trumpets, usually played in pairs for invocation of fierce deities and to signal entry of masked dancers in the '''chams''; long, metal bass trumpets and white, end-blown conch-shell trumpets; wooden shawms; and a range of cymbals and double- and single-headed frame drums."
</blockquote>

Trance and the energetic use of sound is accompanied by sophisticated possession induced trance dances where the practitioners carry the 'aspect' of the deity or thoughtform, or transform into the yidam, elemental process, or dæmon.<ref>Pegg (2006), </ref>

==Geography and Bön==

Tibet is not confined culturally to modern political Tibet. The broader area of ethnic Tibet also includes to the east, parts of the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan; to the west, the Indian regions of Ladakh, Lahul and Spiti; to the south, Bhutan, Sikkim, parts of northern Nepal, the Sherpa and Tamang regions of eastern Nepal and the extreme north-west of Assam.

The altitude and vastness of the Tibetan Region is striking, landscape uncrompromisingly dominated by mountains and sky, where the starkness of the human condition relentlessly tested the mettle of its peoples. The lofty Tibetan Plateau and Geography of Tibet has had a profound effect on the Bonpo and the shaping of Vajrayana in general. Many of the local deities (''jik ten pa'') pre-dating the arrival of Buddhism, were co-opted and made 'protectors' of the Vajrayana and various teachings:
<blockquote>
"The Tibetan legends testify to an inseparable sacred connection between the land of Tibet
and its peoples that pre-dates the arrival of Buddhism. Of course many of these attitudes
and ideas would later find themselves placed in a Buddhist context and given significance
within a Buddhist doctrinal framework. Pre-Buddhist gods of mountains and rocks (dre,
trin, tsen) were thus described as ‘worldly gods’(''jik ten pa'') who allowed themselves to be
converted to ‘Protectors’ or ’Defenders’ of the Dharma (the Buddhist teaching and path) by
Padmasambhava the legendary bringer of Buddhism to Tibet in the seventh century. The
gods and goddesses were said to possess magical powers and were capable of working
miracles. Nevertheless the lay Tibetan practitioner had to remain wary of these gods as they
were not always benign. Once the ire of such gods was invoked then their violent nature
often succeeded in gaining the upper hand."
</blockquote>

==Gods of home and hearth==
Bonpo cultivate household gods in addition to other deities:
<blockquote>
"Traditionally in Tibet divine presences or deities would be incorporated into the very
construction of the house making it in effect a castle (''dzong ka'') against the malevolent forces outside of it. The average Tibetan house would have a number of houses or seats (''poe
khang'') for the male god (''pho lha'') that protects the house. Everyday the man of the house
would invoke this god and burn juniper wood and leaves to placate him. In addition the
woman of the house would also have a protecting deity (''phuk lha'') whose seat could be
found within the kitchen usually at the top of the pole that supported the roof." <ref>Source:  http://www.sharpham-trust.org/centre/Tibetan_unit_01.pdf; Thursday January 18, 2007</ref>
</blockquote>

Bön's leading monastery is the Menri Monastery in Dolanji, India (Himachal Pradesh).

==Historical phases of Bön==
According to the Bönpo themselves,<ref>Baumer, C. (2002). ''Bon: Tibet's Ancient Religion''. Orchid Press, Thailand. ISBN 9745240117</ref> the Bön religion has actually gone through three distinct phases: Animistic Bön, Yungdrung or Eternal Bön, and New Bön.

===Animistic Bön===
The first phase of Bön was grounded in animistic and shamanistic practices and corresponds to the general characterization of Bön as described by western scholars.

Initiation rituals and rites closely correlate to the indigenous shamanic traditions of Siberia. Many Bönpo shaman were members of a clan-guild from which the volume of shaman came. Shaman were of either gender. A shamanic aspirant was often visited and possessed by an ancestral shaman and/or one or more of any number of entities such as gods, elementals, dæmons, and spirits.  The possession typically results in a divine madness and a temporary retreat into the wilderness, where the shaman lives like an animal and experiences visions of his own death at the hands of spirits.

After the newly-possessed shaman returns, they are taught by senior practitioners and members of the clan-guild how to exert power over the spirits that visit them, as well as incantation of mantra.<ref>Kernaghan, Eileen.[http://home.portal.ca/~lonewolf/shaman.htm The Nameless Religion: An Overview of Bon Shamanism]</ref>

===Yungdrung Bön===
The religion's second era is the contentious phase, which rests on the assertions of the Bönpo texts and traditions (which are extensive and only now being analyzed in the West).

These texts assert that Yungdrung Bön was founded by the Buddha Tönpa Shenrab Miwoche.  He discovered the methods of attaining enlightenment and is considered to be a figure analogous to Persian Tajik).

According to Buddhist legend, prior to the manifestation of Zhangzhung of western Tibet who had previously been practicing animistic Bön, thus establishing Yungdrung ("eternal") Bön.

One interesting premise, countered by most Himalayan scholars (), is that Buddhism may have arrived in Tibet by a path other than directly from northwest India. A transmission through Greco-Buddhist art style in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Additionally, the 6th century Khosrau I of Persia is known to have ordered the translation of the Buddhist jataka tales into the Persian language.  The Silk Road, the path by which Buddhism traveled to China in 67 CE., lies entirely to the west of Tibet and passed through the Persian city of Hamadan.  Recently, Buddhist structures have been discovered in far western Tibet that have been dated to the third century CE. Bönpo stupas have also been discovered as far west as Afghanistan.

Nonetheless, no scholars have yet identified a major center of Buddhist learning in Persia which corresponds to the Bönpos' land of Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring. Alternative proposed sites have included the ancient cities of Merv, Khotan or Balkh, all of which had thriving Buddhist communities active in the correct timeframe and are located to the west of Tibet.

The existence of the Zhang Zhung culture is supported by many lines of evidence, including the existence of a remnant of living Shangshung speakers still found in Himachal Pradesh.  The claim that Lord Shenrab was born 180 centuries ago is generally not taken literally (), but understood as an allusion to a master born in the very distant past.
