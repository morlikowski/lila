:''Pe scurt: un subiect este considerat notabil dacă a fost descris în detaliu în surse de încredere independente de subiect.''

Pentru ca unui subiect să-i poată fi dedicat un articol separat în Wikipedia, una dintre condiţii este ca acel subiect să prezinte interes enciclopedic, adică să fie suficient de '''notabil'''<ref>Sensul cu care folosim temenul ''notabil'' aici este acela de ''remarcabil'', ''demn de luat în consideraţie'', ''relevant''.</ref> în domeniul din care face parte. Notabilitatea nu trebuie confundată cu faima, importanţa sau notorietatea, deşi aceste caracteristici pot contribui la nivelul de notabilitate. Un subiect este considerat notabil dacă îndeplineşte criteriul general de notabilitate din secţiunea următoare sau standardele defalcate pe tipuri particulare de subiecte din celelalte secţiuni.

Subiectele care nu îndeplinesc criteriul notabilităţii, dar care sînt verificabile, pot fi menţionate în cadrul altor articole.

Notabilitatea nu este singurul criteriu care limitează includerea în Wikipedia. O serie de criterii de ''excludere'' pot fi găsite la pagina Ce nu este Wikipedia.

Condiţia de notabilitate stabileşte numai admisibilitatea articolelor separate despre subiectele în cauză, dar nu are un efect direct asupra conţinutului articolelor. Acesta din urmă este determinat, printre altele, de politicile privitoare la punctul de vedere neutru, verificabilitate, cercetarea originală etc.

==Criteriul general de notabilitate==

Condiţia de notabilitate aplicabilă oricărui tip de subiect poate fi exprimată succint astfel:

'''Un subiect este considerat notabil dacă a fost descris în detaliu în surse de încredere independente de subiect.'''

În acest context:
*Prin „este considerat” se înţelege că subiectul îndeplineşte condiţia în mod obiectiv, independent de opiniile contribuitorilor.
*Prin „descris în detaliu” se înţelege că sursele discută subiectul în mod direct, în suficiente detalii pentru a permite redactarea unui articol enciclopedic fără a fi nevoie să se recurgă la cercetare originală pentru a extrage conţinutul util. Acoperirea subiectului în surse poate să nu fie exhaustivă, dar trebuie să fie mai mult decît tangenţială.
*Prin „surse” se înţeleg sursele secundare, care sînt cele mai obiective dovezi în sprijinul notabilităţii. Numărul şi natura surselor necesare depind de profunzimea în care este descris subiectul şi calitatea surselor. Se preferă susţinerea notabilităţii prin mai multe surse.
*Prin „încredere” se înţelege faptul că sursele trebuie să aibă un mecanism editorial suficient de riguros pentru a permite evaluarea notabilităţii. Forma de publicare a surselor nu este relevantă. Existenţa surselor secundare referitoare la subiect este o dovadă suficientă pentru notabilitate.
*Prin „independente de subiect” se înţelege că nu se iau în considerare sursele publicate de persoane sau grupuri afiliate cu subiectul, de exemplu autobiografii, lucrări autopublicate, reclame, declaraţii de presă etc.

==Criterii pentru cazuri particulare==

Subsecţiunile următoare oferă criterii orientative, detaliate pentru diverse tipuri particulare de subiecte.

Within Wikipedia, '''notability''' is an inclusion criterion based on encyclopedic suitability of a topic for a Wikipedia article.  The topic of an article should be notable, or "worthy of notice."  Notability is distinct from "fame," "importance," or "popularity," although these may positively correlate with it.  A topic is presumed to be sufficiently notable to merit an article if it meets the general notability guidelines below, or if it meets an accepted subject-specific standard listed in the table at the right. If an article currently does not cite reliable secondary sources, that does not necessarily mean that its topic is not notable.

These notability guidelines only pertain to the encyclopedic suitability of '''topics''' for articles but do not directly limit the content of articles.  Relevant content policies include: Neutral point of view, Verifiability, No original research, What Wikipedia is not, and Biographies of living persons.

== General notability guideline ==

If a '''topic''' has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject, it is presumed to be notable.

* ''"Significant coverage"'' means that sources address the subject directly in detail, and no original research is needed to extract the content. Significant coverage is more than trivial but may be less than exclusive.<ref>Examples: The 360-page book by Sobel and the 528-page book by Black on IBM are plainly non-trivial.  The one sentence mention by Walker of the band ''Three Blind Mice'' in a biography of Bill Clinton () is plainly trivial.</ref>
* ''"Reliable"'' means sources need editorial integrity to allow verifiable evaluation of notability, per the reliable source guideline. Sources may encompass published works in all forms and media. Availability of secondary sources covering the subject is a good test for notability.<ref>Self-promotion, autobiography, and product placement are not the routes to having an encyclopedia article.  The published works should be ''someone else'' writing independently about the topic. The barometer of notability is whether people ''independent'' of the topic itself (or of its manufacturer, creator, author, inventor, or vendor) have actually considered the topic notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works of their own that focus upon it. Otherwise, someone could give their own topic as much notability as they want by simply expounding on it outside of Wikipedia, which would defeat the purpose of the concept. Also, neutral sources should exist in order to guarantee a neutral article can be written &mdash; self-promotion is ''not'' neutral (obviously), and self-published sources often are biased if even unintentionally: see Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Conflict of interest for discussion of neutrality concerns of such sources. Even ''non''-promotional self-published sources, in the rare cases they may exist, are still ''not'' evidence of notability as they do not measure the ''attention a subject has received by the world at large''.</ref>
* ''"Sources,"''<ref>Including but not limited to newspapers, books and e-books, magazines, television and radio documentaries, reports by government agencies, scientific journals, etc. In the absence of multiple sources, it must be possible to verify that the source reflects a neutral point of view, is credible and provides sufficient detail for a comprehensive article.</ref> defined on Wikipedia as secondary sources, provide the most objective evidence of notability. The number and nature of reliable sources needed varies depending on the depth of coverage and quality of the sources. Multiple sources are generally preferred.<ref>Lack of multiple sources suggests that the topic may be more suitable for inclusion in an article on a broader topic. Mere republications of a single source or news wire service do not always constitute multiple works. Several journals simultaneously publishing articles in the same geographic region about an occurrence, does not always constitute multiple works, especially when the authors are relying on the same sources, and merely restating the same information. Specifically, several journals publishing the same article within the same geographic region from a news wire service is not a multiplicity of works.</ref>
* ''"Independent of the subject"'' excludes works produced by those affiliated with the subject including (but not limited to): self-publicity, advertising, self-published material by the subject, autobiographies, press releases, etc.<ref>Works produced by the subject, or those with a strong connection to them, are unlikely to be strong evidence of interest by the world at large. See also: Wikipedia:Conflict of interest for handling of such situations.</ref>
* ''"Presumed"'' means that substantive coverage in reliable sources establishes a presumption, not a guarantee, of notability. Editors may reach a consensus that although a topic meets this criterion, it is not suitable for inclusion. For example, it may violate what Wikipedia is not.<ref>Moreover, not all coverage in reliable sources constitutes evidence of notability for the purposes of article creation; for example, directories and databases, advertisements, announcements columns, and minor news stories are all examples of coverage that may not actually support notability when examined, despite their existence as reliable sources.</ref> 

A topic for which this criterion is deemed to have been met by consensus, is usually worthy of notice, and satisfies one of the criteria for a stand-alone article in the encyclopedia. Verifiable facts and content not supported by multiple independent sources may be appropriate for inclusion within another article.

==  <span id="OBJ" /> Notability requires objective evidence ==

The common theme in the notability guidelines is the requirement for verifiable objective evidence to support a claim of notability. Substantial coverage in reliable sources constitutes such objective evidence, as do published peer recognition and the other factors listed in the subject specific guidelines.

Wikipedia is not a news source: it takes more than just a short burst of news reports about a single event or topic to constitute evidence of sufficient notability. The Wikimedia project Wikinews covers topics of present news coverage.

==Articles not satisfying the notability guidelines==
Although articles should demonstrate the notability of their topics, and articles on topics that do not meet this criteria are generally deleted, it is important to not just consider whether notability is established by the article, but whether it readily could be. When discussing whether to delete or merge an article due to non-notability, the discussion should focus not only on whether notability is established in the article, but on what the probability is that notability could be established. If it is likely that independent sources could be found for a topic, deletion due to lack of notability is inappropriate unless active effort has been made to find these sources.  For articles of unclear notability, deletion should be a last resort.

If an article fails to cite sufficient sources to demonstrate the notability of its subject, look for sources yourself, or:
*Ask the article's creator or an expert on the subject<ref>Sometimes contacting the subject of a biography or the representative of a subject organization will yield independent source material.  Of course we have to be careful to observe and evaluate independence.  You might also see if there is a wikipedia project related to the topic, and ask for help there.</ref>  for advice on where to look for sources.
*Put the  tag on the article to alert other editors. To place a dated tag, put a  tag.
*If the article is about a specialized field, use the  tag with a specific WikiProject to attract editors knowledgeable about that field, who may have access to reliable sources not available online.

If appropriate sources cannot be found, consider merging the article's content into a broader article providing context.<ref>For instance, articles on minor characters in a work of fiction may be merged into a "list of minor characters in ..."; articles on schools may be merged into articles on the towns or regions where schools are located; relatives of a famous person may be merged into the article on the person; articles on persons only notable for being associated with a certain group or event may be merged into the main article on that group or event.</ref> Otherwise, if deleting:<ref>Wikipedia editors have been known to reject nominations for deletion that have been inadequately researched. Research should include attempts to find sources which might demonstrate notability, and/or information which would demonstrate notability in another manner.</ref>
*If the article meets our criteria for speedy deletion, one can use a criterion-specific deletion tag listed on that page.
*Use the  tag, for articles which do not meet the criteria for speedy deletion, but are uncontroversial deletion candidates. This allows the article to be deleted after five days if nobody objects.  For more information, see Wikipedia:Proposed deletion.
*For cases where you are unsure about deletion or believe others might object, nominate the article for the articles for deletion process, where the merits will be debated and deliberated for 5 days.
