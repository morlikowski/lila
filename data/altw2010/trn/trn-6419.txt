==解説==
「プラン9・フロム・アウタースペース」完成に至るまでのエド・ウッドの「黄金期」を描いた作品で、ウッドの知名度を飛躍的に高める契機となった。なお、作品中であこがれのオーソン・ウェルズと偶然出会うシーンは脚色で、実際には本人は生涯ウェルズに会うことはなかった。ウェルズもまた生涯映画の資金繰りに苦労した人物で、片や「映画史上最高」、片や「映画史上最低」の才能がどことなく似通った人生を送ったことは興味深い。

'''''Ed Wood''''' is a 1994 American comedic biopic directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp as the cross-dressing cult movie maker Edward D. Wood, Jr. The film, shot in black and white, was based in large part on Rudolph Grey's quasi-biography ''Nightmare of Ecstasy''. The film concerns the period in Wood's life when he made his best-known films and also his relationship with actor Béla Lugosi, played by Martin Landau.

The film was the brainchild of screenwriters Mary Reilly'' fell through. He immediately contacted Depp and asked him to star in the film as Wood and the actor agreed. Depp decided to draw inspiration for his performance from Rick Baker.

The film had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival. Though a box office failure at the time of its release, grossing only USD $5.8 million in North America, it was critically hailed. Landau was widely praised for his performance, earning top honors from the Screen Actors Guild, the National Board of Review, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and winning a Golden Globe and an Academy Award.

===Burton and Wood===
Burton admits to having always been a fan of Ed Wood, which is why the biopic is filmed with an aggrandizing bias borne of his admiration rather than derision of Wood's work.<ref name= "Thompson2">{{cite news

 | accessdate = }}</ref> Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating he did not want to ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood's life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood's eyes.<ref name= "Thompson2"/> He said in an interview, "I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy - saying in, like, five sentences what it would take most normal people one...Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; it gives them a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling."<ref name= "Smith, Gavin"/> Burton's respect for Wood is also hinted at in his film ''Edward Scissorhands'' - the director has stated that he named the lead character in the film ''Edward'' because that's Wood's full first name. The relationship between Wood and Lugosi in the script echoes closely Burton's relationship with his own idol and two-time colleague, Vincent Price. He said in an interview, "Meeting Vincent had an incredible impact on me, the same impact Ed must have felt meeting and working with his idol."<ref name= "Salisbury, Mark"/>

===Casting===

To get a hold on his character, Martin Landau started with make-up tests with Rick Baker. He did not use extensive make-up applications, only enough to resemble Lugosi and allow Landau to use his face to act and express emotion.<ref name= "French, Lawrence">{{cite news

"Lugosi was theatrical, but I never wanted the audience to feel I was an actor chewing the scenery...I felt it had to be Lugosi's theatricality, not mine."<ref name= "French, Lawrence"/>

===Pre-production===
The film was originally in development with Columbia Pictures but when Burton wanted to shoot it in black and white, the studio wasn't going to back it because they claimed it would be a hard sell in foreign markets and on video<ref name= "Clark, John"/> and unless they had a first-look deal.<ref name= "Salisbury, Mark"/> The director insisted on total control and a month before shooting was scheduled to start, Columbia put the film in turnaround. Warner Brothers, Paramount Pictures, and 20th Century Fox became interested in optioning the film, but Burton went with Disney because they gave him total creative control on the condition that he work for scale.<ref name= "Salisbury, Mark"/>

''Ed Wood'' gave Burton the opportunity to make a film that was more character-driven as opposed to style-driven. He said in an interview, "On a picture like this I find you don't need to storyboard. You're working mainly with actors, and there's no effects going on, so it's best to be more spontaneous."<ref name= "French2"/> Shooting began in August 1993 and lasted 72 days.<ref name= "Clark, John"/>
