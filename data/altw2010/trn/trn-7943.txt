'''הצבא האדום''' הוא הכינוי של צבאה של כוחות המזוינים של ברית המועצות. הצבא האדום נקרא כך, בגלל צבע דגלו. הצבא האדום הוקם על ידי מלחמת האזרחים הרוסית, כדי להילחם בקבוצות המתנגדים הידועים כ"מלחמה הפולנית - סובייטית, בהמרד בהונגריה, המרד בצ'כוסלובקיה. כמו כן, השתתף הצבא האדום במלחמת אפגניסטן ובמספר מלחמות ועימותים נוספים. את הצבא ניהל מטה כללי הידוע בכינויו "סטאבקה". הצבא האדום החליף את שמו מאוחר יותר ב"הצבא הסובייטי" אך המשיך להיות ידוע כהצבא האדום.

==הצבא האדום במלחמת האזרחים==
במלחמת האזרחים הבולשביקים לחמו נגד הלבנים, פלישות של אנרכיסטיות דוגמת הצבא השחור של דניקין. כתוצאה מפיצול זה הלבנים הפסידו. הפלישות הזרות לא היו מסוכנות כי מעצמות אירופה היו במצב קשה לאחר מלחמת העולם הראשונה.

==הצבא האדום בין שתי מלחמות עולם==
בתקופה זו הרוסים שקדו על מיכון הצבא והכנסת דוקטרינות לחימה שיתאימו לרוח הזמן. הצבא האדום גדל וקיבל תקציבי ענק. למשל מספר הטנקים שהיו לרשות הרוסים לפני פרוץ מלחמת העולם השנייה היה שווה למספר הטנקים בכל המדינות האחרות גם יחד. לצד נסיונות המיכון הגדולים לא צויד הצבא בכמות מתאימה של משאיות, טרקטורים וסוסים וכתוצאה מכך כושר הניידות שלו היה מוגבל למדי.

בנוסף לכך טיהורים שבמהלכם כמעט כל הקצונה הבכירה ודרג הביניים של ברית המועצות, סך הכול כ-35,000 קצינים בכירים ובינוניים הוצאו להורג. ההוצאות ההמוניות להורג גרמו לקיפאון במחשבה הצבאית בגלל החשש של הקצינים להתבלט מעל האחרים. הקיפאון בטקטיקה ובמחשבה החופשית והעדר אימון ראוי גררו אחריהן את התבוסות הקשות בתחילת מלחמת העולם השנייה.

==הצבא האדום בזמן מלחמת העולם השנייה==
המלחמה הגיעה לברית המועצות בפלישתם של הנאצים במסגרת מבצע ברברוסה ב-22 ביוני 1941. כך נפתחה החזית המזרחית במלחמת העולם השנייה. 

למלחמת העולם השנייה הצבא האדום הגיע ללא מפקדיו, וגרוע מכך המפקדים שכן שרדו פחדו להביע את דעתם. המצב היה עגום עד כדי כך, שלא נשאר לצבא האדום כמעט ציוד מלחמתי כאשר הלחימה הגיע עד מוסקבה. למרות זאת, הרוסים התעשתו והצליחו להדוף את הגרמנים בגרמנים שולטים כמעט בכל השטח שבין קו מוסקבה-לנינגרד ודרומה
והגבול המדיני של ברית המועצות. 

לאחר כניסתה של רוסיה למלחמת העולם השנייה, שהרוסים התייחסו אליה כ'''המלחמה הפטריוטית הגדולה''' הרוסים הצליחו לגייס 29,574,900 חיילים חדשים בנוסף ל-4,826,907 בשירות בתחילת המלחמה. מביניהם נהרגו כ-8,668,400 איש.
===ארגון הצבא האדום===
הצבא האדום אורגן ביחידות אופרטיביות עצמאיות - דיוויזיות. כמה דיוויזיות (בדרך כלל, 2-4) התכנסו לקורפוס וכמה קורפוסים (בדרך כלל, 2-4) היו ארמיה. כמה ארמיות (בדרך כלל, 2-4) היוו "חזית".

המונח המקביל באנגלית הוא "בריגדות ויחידות עצמאיות אחרות, אך מספרן ירד עם הזמן.

כאמור, היחידה העצמאית העיקרית הייתה דיוויזיה. היו מספר סוגים עיקריים (סוגים נוספים לא היו בשימוש נרחב):
* דיביזיית רגלים (קלעים בטרמינולוגיה הרוסית)
* דיביזיית פרשים
* דיביזיית צנחנים
* דיוויזיה ממוכנת
* דיביזיית שיריון - ההבדל העיקרי בין דיביזה משורינת לממוכנת הוא במספר וסוג הטנקים. דיביזיית שיריון הייתה חזקה יותר.
* דיוויזיה הררית

** מספרי החיילים, המשאיות וסוסים בטבלה הם מקורבים
** המספרים נכונים לשנת 1941. בהמשך הם השתנו עקב האבדות בחזית

The '''Red Army''' (Russian: Рабоче-Крестьянская Красная Армия, '''R'''aboche-'''K'''rest'yanskaya '''K'''rasnaya '''A'''rmiya; '''RKKA''', full translation the '''Workers' and Peasants' Red Army''') was the armed force first organized by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War in 1918 and, in 1922, became the army of the Soviet Union.

"China's People's Liberation Army may have exceeded the Red Army in size during some periods.

This article focuses upon the land force element of the Soviet Army, later called the '''Ground Forces'''. See Soviet Armed Forces for a description of the Soviet armed forces as a whole.

==History==
====Russian Civil War====

As the Red Guards with a permanent force. The Decree on Old Style)</ref> basing it initially on the Red Guards. The official Red Army Day of Imperial German Army.<ref>S.S. Lototskiy, The Soviet Army (Moscow:Progress Publishers, 1971), p.25, cited in Scott and Scott, The Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, Eastview Press, Boulder, Co., 1979, p.3. February 23 became an important national holiday in the Lenin's dissolution of the White Armies.<ref>Other forces fighting in the Civil War included the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine or 'Black Army' of Nestor Makhno, and the Green Army.</ref>

The founder of the Red Army is often seen as "military specialist". A number of prominent Soviet Army commanders had previously served as Imperial Russian generals. Another important move was the unification of the Bolshevik military effort from several former organizations with the formation of the Ioakhim Vatsetis, a Latvian ex-Colonel of the Imperial army, became first Soviet Commander-in-Chief. Trotsky then had to make considerable efforts to root out the 'military anarchism' of the first chaotic months of the Red Army, adopting the slogan of 'exhortion, organization, and reprisals', and in some cases having to resort to firing squads to punish deserters.<ref>Erickson, 1962, p.38–9</ref> To ensure the loyalty of the ex-Imperial military specialists, and to bind the disparate elements of the new Red Army together, the military commissars were introduced.

The first period of the Civil War lasted from the 1917 Revolution until the November 1918 Armistice. First, in late November of 1917 the new Bolshevik government declared that traditional Don region headed by General Kaledin, where the Volunteer Army began amassing support. The signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk also resulted in direct Allied intervention in Russia and the arming of military forces opposed to the Bolshevik government. There were also many German commanders who offered support against the Bolsheviks. Most of the fighting in this first period was sporadic, involving only small groups (including the Czechoslovak Legion, the Polish 5th Rifle Division and the pro-Bolshevik Red Latvian Riflemen) amid a fluid and rapidly shifting military scene.

The second period of the war was the key stage, which lasted from January to November of 1919. At first the White armies' advances from the south (under Kolchak) and the northwest (under Yudenich) were successful, pushing back the new Red Army on all three fronts. But Leon Trotsky reformed the Red Army and pushed back Kolchak's forces (in June) and Denikin's and Yudenich's armies (in October).<ref name="autogenerated3">defeat there, which put an end to the war. During the Polish campaign the Red Army numbered some 5.5 million men, of which the Army had difficulty supporting around 581,000 in the two operational fronts, Western and Southwestern. Around 2.5 million men were 'immobilised in the interior' as part of reserve armies.<ref>Erickson, 1962, p.101</ref> Following the defeat of Pyotr Wrangel in the south,<ref>Erickson, 1962, p.102–107</ref> the Communists had won after four years of savage fighting, and established the John Erickson dates the rise of the General Staff, which came to dominate Soviet military planning and operations, to that date. By 1 October 1924 the army's strength dropped to 530,000.<ref>Erickson,  1962, p.167</ref> This list of divisions expands on the fortunes of the individual formations of the Red Army during that period.

====Deep Operations====
Later in the 1920s and during the 1930s, Soviet military theorists introduced the concept of deep battle.<ref>airpower should be "employed against targets beyond the range of infantry, artillery, and other arms. For maximum tactical effect aircraft should be employed in mass, concentrated in time and space, against targets of the highest tactical importance."

Deep Operations were first formally expressed as a concept in the Red Army's 'Field Regulations' of 1929, but was only finally codified by the army in 1936 in the 'Provisional Field Regulations' of 1936. However the in 1938 and 1939.

====World War II====

thumb|right|250px|Soviet and German soldiers during the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]]

Despite the USSR remaining initially neutral in invasion of the Polish eastern territory in September 1939, with little resistance, and fought in a Barbarossa’, which opened by saying “the German Armed forces must be prepared to crush Soviet Russia in a quick campaign before the end of the war against England”. On February 3, 1941, the final plan of Operation Barbarossa gained approval, and the attack was scheduled for the middle of May, 1941. However, the events in Greece and Yugoslavia necessitated a delay — to the second half of June.

At the time of the Nazi assault on the USSR in June 1941, the Red Army's ground forces had 303 divisions and 22 brigades (4.8 million troops), including 166 divisions and 9 brigades (2.9 million troops) stationed in the western military districts. Their Axis opponents deployed on the Eastern Front 181 divisions and 18 brigades (5.5 million troops). Three Fronts, the Western, and the Southwestern, controlled the forces defending the western border. However the first weeks of the war saw major Soviet defeats as German forces trapped hundreds of thousands of Red Army soldiers in vast encirclements, causing the loss of major equipment, tanks, and artillery. Stalin and the Soviet leadership responded by stepping up the mobilization that was already under way, and by 1 August 1941, despite the loss of 46 divisions in combat, the Red Army's strength stood at 401 divisions.<ref>David Glantz, Stumbling Colossus, University Press of Kansas, 1998, p.15</ref>

Soviet forces suffered heavy damage in the field as a result of poor levels of preparedness, whose primary causes were inadequate officers, as a result of the purges, disorganization as a result of a partially completed mobilization, and the reorganization the Army was undergoing.<ref>Purges offset the balance favorably for the Germans.<ref name="autogenerated2"> David Glantz, Stumbling Colossus, University Press of Kansas, 1998</ref> The sheer numeric superiority of the Axis cannot be underestimated, though the combat strength of the two opposing forces appears to have been roughly equal in numbers of divisions.<ref>David Glantz in Stumbling Colossus discusses the correlation of forces in Appendix D (pages 292–295), and concludes that the Axis forces had a superiority of 1:1.7 in personnel, though the Red Army had 174 divisions to the Axis' 164, a 1.1:1 ratio.</ref>

A generation of Soviet commanders (most notably Zhukov) learned from the defeats,<ref>Stalingrad, Kursk and later in Operation Bagration proved decisive in what became known to the Soviets as the Great Patriotic War.

The Soviet government adopted a number of measures to improve the state and morale of the retreating Red Army in 1941. Soviet propaganda turned away from political notions of Napoleon. References to ancient Russian military heroes such as Alexander Nevski and Mikhail Kutuzov appeared. Repressions against the Russian Orthodox Church stopped, and priests revived the tradition of blessing arms before battle. The Communist Party abolished the institution of political commissars — although it soon restored them. The Red Army re-introduced military ranks and adopted many additional individual distinctions such as medals and orders. The concept of the Imperial Guard re-appeared: units which had shown exceptional heroism in combat gained the designation of Guards unit (for example 1st Guards Special Rifle Corps, 6th Guards Tank Army).<ref>David Glantz, Colossus Reborn: The Red Army at War 1941–43, University Press of Kansas, 2005, p.181</ref> This designation was more than symbolic, as Guards units had a more effectice TOE (table of organisation & equipment), and were thus allowed to draw better equipment, and drew the best recruits from training grounds and academies. Guardsmen also drew higher pay, and outranked non-guardsmen of the same nominal rank.

During the Great Patriotic War, the Red Army conscripted 29,574,900 men in addition to the 4,826,907 in service at the beginning of the war. Of these it lost 6,329,600 KIA, 555,400 deaths by disease and 4,559,000 MIA (most captured). Of these 11,444,100, however, 939,700 re-joined the ranks in the subsequently-liberated Soviet territory, and a further 1,836,000 returned from German captivity. Thus the grand total of losses amounted to 8,668,400. The majority of the losses, excluding POWs, being ethnic Russians (5,756,000), followed by ethnic Ukrainians (1,377,400). <ref>See Г. Ф. Кривошеев, ''Россия и СССР в войнах XX века: потери вооруженных сил. Статистическое исследование'' (G. F. Krivosheev, ''Russia and the USSR in the wars of the 20th century: losses of the Armed Forces. A Statistical Study'', in Russian)</ref> However, as many as 8 million of the 34 million mobilized were non-Slavic minority soldiers, and around 45 divisions formed from national minorities served from 1941 to 1943.<ref>Glantz, Colossus Reborn: The Red Army at War 1941–43, University Press of Kansas, 2005, p.600–602</ref>

The German losses on the Eastern Front comprised an estimated 3,604,800 KIA within the 1937 borders plus 900,000 ethnic Germans and Austrians. Approximately 1,800,000 MIA and 3,576,300 captured (total 9,881,100); the losses of the German satellites on the Eastern Front approximated 668,163 KIA/MIA and 799,982 captured (total 1,468,145). Of these 11,349,245, the Soviets released 3,572,600 from captivity after the war, thus the grand total of the Axis losses came to an estimated 7,776,645.<ref>Rűdiger Overmans, ''Deutsche militärische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg''. Oldenbourg 2000. ISBN 3-486-56531-1</ref> As regards prisoners of war, both sides captured large numbers and had many die in captivity - one recent Russian figure says 3,6 of 6 million Soviet POWs died in German camps, while 300,000 of 3 million German POWs died in Soviet hands.<ref>German-Russian Berlin-Karlhorst museum, http://newsfromrussia.com/science/2003/06/13/48180.html</ref>

In the first part of the war, the Red Army fielded weaponry of mixed quality. It had excellent artillery, but it did not have enough trucks to maneuver and supply it; as a result the Wehrmacht (which rated it highly) captured much of it. Red Army T-34 tanks generally outclassed other tanks until 1943, yet most of the Soviet armored units were less advanced models; likewise, the same supply problem handicapped even the formations equipped with the most modern tanks. The Soviet Air Force initially performed poorly against the Germans. The quick advance of the Germans into the Soviet territory made reinforcement and replacements much more difficult since much of the Soviet Union's military industry lay in the west of the country. Until the Soviet authorities re-established the industry east of the Urals, much improvisation was necessary, and Soviet units were routinely far below their weapons establishment levels.<ref>Antony Beevor, ''Stalingrad'', 1998.

After World War II the Soviet Army had the most powerful land army in history. It had more tanks or artillery than all other countries taken together, more soldiers, and large numbers of greatly experienced commanders and staffs. The British Chiefs of Staff Committee rejected as militarily unfeasible a British contingency plan, Operation Unthinkable,<ref>[http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/026.htm Operation Unthinkable report - page 2, opening date.]</ref> to destroy Stalin's government and drive the Red Army out of Europe.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

====The Cold War====

To mark the final step in the transformation from a revolutionary militia to a regular army of a sovereign state, the Red Army gained the official name of the "Soviet Army" in 1946. Georgi Zhukov took over as chief of the Soviet Ground Forces in March 1946, but was quickly succeeded by Ivan Konev in July. Konev held the appointment until 1950, when the position was abolished for five years. Scott and Scott speculate that the gap 'probably was associated in some manner with the Korean War'.<ref>Scott and Scott, The Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, Eastview Press, Boulder, Co., 1979, p.142</ref>

====The end of the Soviet Union====
thumb|right|Monument to the Red Army in [[Berlin]]

From around 1985 to 1990, the new leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to reduce the strain the Army placed on economic demands. His government slowly reduced the size of the army. In 1989 Soviet forces left Afghanistan. By the end of 1990, the entire Eastern Bloc had collapsed in the wake of democratic revolutions. As a result, Soviet citizens quickly began to turn against the Communist government as well. In 1990 the Baltic republics began declare their independence. Gorbachev reacted in limited fashion, declining to turn the Army against the citizenry, and a crisis developed. By mid-1991, the Soviet Union had reached a state of emergency.<ref>Helene Carrere D'Encausse, ''The End of the Soviet Empire: The Triumph of the Nations'', Basic Books, 1992, ISBN 0-465-09818-5</ref>

According to the official commission, the Academy of Soviet Scientists, immediately after the Soviet coup attempt of 1991, the Armed Forces did not play a significant role in what some describe as coup d'état by old-guard communists. Commanders sent tanks into the streets of Moscow, but (according to all the commanders and soldiers) only with orders to ensure the safety of the people. It remains unclear why exactly the military forces entered the city, but they clearly did not have the goal of overthrowing Gorbachev (absent on the Black Sea coast at the time) or the government. The coup failed primarily because the participants didn't take any decisive action, and after several days of their inaction the coup simply stopped. Only one confrontation took place between civilians and the tank crews during the coup, which led to the deaths of three civilians. Although the victims became proclaimed heroes, the authorities acquitted the tank crew of all charges. Nobody issued orders to shoot at anyone.<ref>David Remnick, ''Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire'', Vintage Books, 1994, ISBN 0-679-75125-4</ref>

Following the coup attempt of August 1991, the leadership of the Soviet Union retained practically no authority over the component republics. Nearly every Soviet Republic declared its intention to secede and began passing laws defying the Supreme Soviet. On December 8 1991 the Presidents of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine declared the Soviet Union dissolved and signed the document setting up the Commonwealth of Independent States. Gorbachev finally resigned on December 25, 1991, and the following day the Supreme Soviet, the highest governmental body, dissolved itself, officially ending the Soviet Union's existence. For the next year and a half various attempts to keep its unity and transform it into the military of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) failed. Steadily, the units stationed in Ukraine and other breakaway republics swore loyalty to their new national governments.

After the Kazakh Army. As a result, the bulk of the Soviet Ground Forces, including most of the list of Soviet Army divisions sketches some of the fates of the individual parts of the Ground Forces.

In mid-March 1992, Yeltsin appointed himself as the new Russian minister of defense, marking a crucial step in the creation of the new Russian armed forces, comprising the bulk of what was still left of the military. The last vestiges of the old Soviet command structure were finally dissolved in June 1993, when the paper Commonwealth of Independent States Military Headquarters was reorganized as a staff for facilitating CIS military cooperation.<ref>Jack F. Matlock, Jr., ''Autopsy on an Empire: The American Ambassador's Account of the Collapse of the Soviet Union'', Random House, 1995, ISBN 0679413766

In the next few years, the former Soviet Ground Forces withdrew from central and Eastern Europe (including the Georgia, and Transnistria.

==Organization==

At the beginning of its existence, the Red Army functioned as a voluntary formation, without ranks or insignia. Democratic elections selected the officers. However, a decree of May 29, 1918 imposed obligatory military service for men of ages 18 to 40.<ref>Scott and Scott, 1979, p.5</ref> To service the massive draft, the Bolsheviks formed regional military commissariats (''voyennyy komissariat'', abbr. ''voyenkomat''), which as of 2006 still exist in Russia in this function and under this name. Military commissariats however should not be confused with the institution of military political commissars.
thumb|150px|left|[[Red flag|Red Army flag]]

In the mid-1920s the territorial principal of manning the Red Army was introduced. In each region able-bodied men were called up for a limited period of active duty in territorial units, which comprised about half the Army's strength, each year, for five years.<ref>Scott and Scott, 1979, p.12</ref> The first call-up period was for three months, with one month a year thereafter. A regular cadre provided a stable nucleus. By 1925 this system provided 46 of the 77 infantry divisions and one of the eleven cavalry divisions. The remainder consisted of regular officers and enlisted personnel serving two-year terms. The territorial system was finally abolished, with all remaining formations converted to the other cadre divisions, in 1937–38.<ref>David Glantz, Colossus Reborn: The Red Army at War 1941–43, University Press of Kansas, 2005, p.717 note 5.</ref>
