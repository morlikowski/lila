'''''Detective Comics''''' est un comics publié par DC Comics depuis 1937. C'est l'un des titres les plus connus de la société (avec ''Action Comics'' qui vu naître Superman). En fait, le « DC » de l'éditeur vient des initiales de « Detective Comics ». C'est aussi le comics à la plus grande longévité puisqu'il est toujours publié aux États-Unis en 2005.

À l'origine le comics publiait diverses histoires, principalement de détectives (genre le plus populaire de l'époque). Le premier numéro comportait des histoires avec les personnages «Ching Lung» (un méchant oriental dans le style Fu Manchu), Slam Bradley (créé par Jerry Siegel et Joe Shuster), et Speed Saunders, parmi d'autres. 

La gloire de ''Detective Comics'' fut assurée lors des débuts en ses pages de Batman (appelé tout d'abord « The Bat-Man ») dans le numéro #27 (le numéro de ''Mai 1939'', publié en avril 1939). Il devint le héros principal de la publication. Des exemplaires en bon état de ce numéro ont atteint les valeurs de 80.000$ en 1992 et 300.000$ en 2003, d'après Stephen Fishler.

Le compagnon de Batman, Robin, fit ses débuts dans le numéro #38 (d'''Avril 1940''). Son apparence (et les ventes croissantes du périodique) conduisirent rapidement à l'essor des justiciers costumés et leurs jeunes compagnons dans les comics de cette époque.

''Detective Comics'' was the final publication of the entrepreneur New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine'' #1 (Feb. 1935), colloquially called ''New Fun Comics'' #1 and the first such early comic book to contain all-original content, rather than a mix of newspaper comic strips and comic-strip-style new material. His second effort, ''New Comics'' #1, would be retitled twice to become ''Adventure Comics'', another seminal series that ran for decades until issue #503 in 1983.

The third and final title published under his aegis would be ''Detective Comics'', advertised with a cover illustration dated Dec. 1936, but eventually premiering three months late, with a March 1937 cover date. In 1937, however, Wheeler-Nicholson was in debt to printing-plant owner and magazine distributor pulp-magazine publisher and a principal in the magazine distributorship Independent News. Wheeler-Nicholson took  Donenfeld on as a partner in order to publish ''Detective Comics'' #1 through the newly formed Detective Comics, Inc., with Wheeler-Nicholson and Jack S. Liebowitz, Donenfeld's accountant, listed as owners. Wheeler-Nicholson was forced out a year later.

Originally an anthology comic, in the manner of the times, ''Detective Comics'' #1 (March 1937) featured stories in the "hard-boiled detective" genre popular, with such stars as Ching Lung (a Fu Manchu-style "yellow peril" villain); Slam Bradley (created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster before their character ''Superman'' saw print two years later); and Speed Saunders, among others. Its first editor, Vin Sullivan, also drew the debut issue's cover. 

===Batman===
''Detective Comics''  #27 (May 1939) featured the first appearance of Batman (as "The Bat-Man"). That superhero would eventually become the star of the title, the cover logo of which is often written as "Detective Comics featuring Batman".

Issue #38 (April 1940) introduced Batman's Robin (billed as "The Sensational Character Find of 1940" on the cover). Robin's appearance and the subsequent increase in sales of the book soon led to the trend of superheroes and young sidekicks that characterize the era fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books.

In addition to the Batman stories, the comic also had numerous back up strips such as "Martian Manhunter" which was introduced in ''Detective Comics'' #225.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the magazine adopted the expanded format used by the cancelled ''Batman Family'', adding solo features including "Robin: the Teen Wonder", "Batgirl", "The Human Target" and the anthology called "Tales of Gotham City", which featured the stories of the ordinary people of Gotham City. This was done in part, to boost sales as at the time "Batman Family" outsold Detective Comics, putting Detective Comics in peril of cancellation during the late 1970s.

Another sales ploy of the 1980s was the use of serialization of the main Batman story, as stories from "Detective Comics" and "Batman" directly flowed from one book to another, with cliffhangers at the end of each book's monthly story that would be resolved in the other title of that month.
