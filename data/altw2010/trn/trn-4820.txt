'''AC/DC''' are a rock band formed in Angus and heavy metal,<ref></ref><ref></ref> its members have always classified their music as "rock 'n' roll".<ref name="Bonfire"></ref>

AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, ''High Voltage'', in 1975. Membership remained stable until bassist Mark Evans in 1977. In 1979, the band recorded their highly successful album ''Highway to Hell''. Lead singer and co-songwriter Geordie singer Brian Johnson was selected as Scott's replacement. Later that year, the band released their best selling album, ''Back in Black''.

The band's next album, ''The Razors Edge'' in 1990. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 and contributed to the band's 1995 album ''Ballbreaker''. ''Stiff Upper Lip'' was released in 2000 and was well received by critics. A new album was announced in 2004 and is expected in late 2008.<ref name="currentstatus"></ref>

AC/DC have sold more than 200 million albums worldwide,<ref></ref> including 69 million albums in the US.<ref name="riaa1"></ref> ''Back in Black'' has sold an estimated 42 million units worldwide<ref></ref> and 22 million in the US alone,<ref name="riaa2"></ref> making it the fifth highest-selling album ever in the US. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"<ref></ref> and the seventh "Greatest Heavy Metal Band Of All Time" by MTV.<ref></ref>

==Name and background==
Angus and Malcolm Young developed the idea for the band's name after seeing the acronym "AC/DC" on the back of a sewing machine owned by their sister, Margaret Young. "AC/DC" is an abbreviation for "alternating current/direct current", which indicates that an electrical device can use either type of power. The brothers felt that this name symbolised the band's raw energy and power-driven performances, and love for music so the name stuck.<ref></ref><ref name="ddd"></ref> In some cultures, "AC/DC" is a slang term for bisexuality; the band have said that they were not aware of this usage until it was brought to their attention by a taxi driver one night after a concert early in their career.<ref name="acdc.cc"></ref><ref name="ddd" /> "AC/DC" is pronounced one letter at a time, though the band is popularly known as "Acca Dacca" in Australia.

Brothers Angus, Malcolm, and George Young were born in Sydney, Australia with most of their family in 1963. George was the first to learn to play the guitar. He became a member of The Easybeats, Australia's most successful band of the 1960s. In 1966, they became the first local rock act to have an international hit, with the song "Friday on My Mind".<ref name=albertmusic></ref><ref></ref> Malcolm followed in George's footsteps by playing with a Newcastle, New South Wales band called The Velvet Underground (not to be confused with the New York-based The Velvet Underground).<ref name="cwalker"></ref>

==History==
===Early years: 1973–1977===
In November 1973, Malcolm and Angus Young formed AC/DC and recruited Dave Evans, and Colin Burgess, ex-The Masters Apprentices drummer.<ref></ref> The band played their first gig at a club named Chequers in Sydney on New Year's Eve, 1973.<ref name="longwaytimeline"></ref> They were later signed to the EMI-distributed Albert Productions label for Australia and New Zealand. The early line-up of the band changed often; Colin Burgess was the first member fired, and several bassists and drummers passed through the band during the next year.

By this time, Angus Young had adopted his characteristic school uniform stage outfit. The original uniform was reputedly from his secondary school, Ashfield Boys High School in Sydney; the idea was his sister Margaret's. Angus had tried other costumes, such as Spider-Man, Zorro, a gorilla, and a parody of Superman, named Super-Ang.<ref name="cwalker" /> In fact in its early days, most members of the band dressed in some form of glam or satin outfit but this approach was abandoned when it was discovered Melbourne band Skyhooks had already adopted this approach to their stage presentation.

The Young brothers decided that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group, because they felt he was more of a manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet prior to Ronald Belford "Bon" Scott, an experienced vocalist and friend of George Young's, was interested in becoming their vocalist.

In September 1974, Bon Scott replaced Dave Evans. The band had recorded only one single with Evans, "Can I Sit Next to You" / "Rockin' in the Parlour", and "Can I Sit Next to You" was eventually re-recorded with Bon Scott under the title "Can I Sit Next to You Girl".

By January 1975, the Australia-only album ''High Voltage'' had been recorded.It was the second album to Jailbreak. It took only ten days<ref name="timeline"></ref> and was based on instrumental songs written by the Young brothers, with lyrics added by Scott. Within a few months, the band's line-up had stabilised, featuring Scott, the Young brothers, bassist Mark Evans and drummer T.N.T.'', which was also released only in Australia and New Zealand. The album featured another classic song, "High Voltage".

Between 1974 and 1977, aided by regular appearances on Countdown'', a nationally broadcast pop music television show, AC/DC became one of the most popular and successful acts in Australia. Their performance on 3 April 1977 was their last live TV appearance for over twenty years.<ref name="timeline" />

===International success: 1977–1980===
In 1976, the band signed an international deal with Atlantic Records, and toured extensively throughout Kiss, Styx and Blue Öyster Cult, and co-headlined with Cheap Trick.<ref name="timeline" />

The first AC/DC album to gain worldwide distribution was a 1976 compilation of tracks taken from the ''High Voltage'' and ''T.N.T.'' LPs. Also titled ''High Voltage'', and released on the Atlantic Records label, the album sold three million copies worldwide,<ref name="BiBBillboard"></ref> partly due to its popularity with a British punk audience.<ref></ref> The track selection was heavily weighted toward the more recent ''T.N.T.'', and included only two songs from their first LP. The band's next album, ''Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap'', was released in the same year in both Australian-only and international versions, like its predecessor. Track listings varied worldwide, and the international version of the album also featured "Rocker" from ''T.N.T.'' The original Australian version included "Jailbreak" (now more readily available on the 1984 compilation EP ''Live'' album). ''Dirty Deeds'' was not released in the US until 1981, by which time the band were at the peak of their popularity.

Following the 1977 recording ''Let There Be Rock'', bassist Mark Evans was sacked due to personal differences with Angus Young. He was replaced by Cliff Williams, who also provided backing vocals alongside Malcolm Young. Neither of the Young brothers has elaborated on the departure of Evans, though Richard Griffiths, the CEO of Epic Records and a booking agent for AC/DC in the mid-1970s, later commented, "You knew Mark wasn't going to last, he was just too much of a nice guy."<ref name="cwalker" />

AC/DC were a formative influence on Saxon and UFO, Scorpions and Mojo (February 2007)</ref>

AC/DC's first American exposure was through the Flint's Capitol Theater. The supporting act was Live Wire" and closed with "It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)".<ref></ref>

AC/DC came to be identified with the punk rock movement by the British press. Their reputation, however, managed to survive the punk upheavals of the late 1970s, and they maintained a cult following in the UK throughout this time.<ref name="Bonfire" /> Angus Young gained notoriety for mooning the audience during live performances.

The 1978 release of ''Apollo Theatre in Let There Be Rock", as well as lesser-known album tracks like "Riff Raff". The album was the last produced by Harry Vanda and George Young with Bon Scott on vocals (although Vanda and Young later produced ''Blow Up Your Video'') and is claimed to be AC/DC's most underrated album.<ref name="popmatters"></ref>

The band's sixth album, ''Highway to Hell'', was produced by Robert Lange and released in 1979. It became the first AC/DC LP to break into the US top 100, eventually reaching #17,<ref name="timeline" /> and it propelled AC/DC into the top ranks of hard rock acts.<ref name="Bonfire" /> ''Highway to Hell'' put increased emphasis on backing vocals but still featured AC/DC's signature sound: loud, simple, pounding riffs and grooving backbeats.<ref></ref> The final track, "Night Prowler", has two breaths in quick succession at the start of the song, intended to create a tone of fear and loathing.<ref name="Bonfire" />

===Scott's death: 1980===

{{Listen

On King's College Hospital in common folklore claims that acute alcohol poisoning" and "death by misadventure".<ref name="BScottDeath"></ref> Scott's family buried him in Fremantle, Western Australia, the area to which they had emigrated when he was a child.<ref></ref>

Inconsistencies in the official accounts of Scott's death have been cited in conspiracy theories, which suggest that Scott died of a heroin overdose, or was killed by exhaust fumes redirected into the car, or that Kinnear did not exist.<ref name="BScottDeath" /> Additionally, Scott was asthmatic,<ref></ref> and the temperature was below freezing on the morning of his death.

===Brian Johnson's arrival and height of fame: 1980–1984===
Following Scott's death, the band briefly considered quitting; they eventually concluded, however, that Scott would have wanted AC/DC to continue, and various candidates were considered for his replacement including Buzz Shearman, ex-Moxy member, who was not able to join due to vocal problems,<ref></ref> and ex-Back Street Crawler vocalist Terry Slesser, who turned down this opportunity when he decided not to join an established band and instead started a solo career. The remaining AC/DC members finally decided on ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson.

Angus Young later recalled, "I remember Bon playing me BBC6 interview, 16 November 2003. See the transcript [http://www.crabsodyinblue.com/acdcbbc6interview.htm here] and [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/qanda/story/0,,1085408,00.html here]. Retrieved on August 2, 2008</ref> Later that night, Johnson would be diagnosed with appendicitis, which was the cause of his writhing around on stage.<ref name="RS-HOF"></ref>

For the audition, Johnson sang "Whole Lotta Rosie" from ''Let There Be Rock'', and Ike & Tina Turner's  "Nutbush City Limits".<ref name="acdc.cc" /> He was hired a few days after the audition.

With Brian Johnson the band completed the songwriting that they had begun with Bon Scott for the album ''Hells Bells", "Back in Black". The album was certified platinum a year after its release,<ref name="BiBBillboard" /> and by 2006 it had sold more than 22 million copies in the United States.<ref name="riaa2" /> The album reached #1 in the UK and #4 in the US, where it spent 131 weeks in the top ten.<ref name="timeline" />, making it the fifth highest-selling album ever in the US.

The follow-up album, 1981's ''For Those About to Rock We Salute You'', also sold well and was positively received by critics. The album featured two of the band's most popular singles: "Let's Get It Up"<ref name=everyhit></ref> and the title track, "For Those About to Rock", which reached #13 and #15 in the UK, respectively.<ref></ref> The band split with Lange for their self-produced 1983 album, ''Flick of the Switch'', in an effort to recover the rawness and simplicity of their early albums.<ref name="flickof"></ref>

===Departure of Rudd and commercial decline: 1984–1987===

  | title = "Let's Get it up" (1981)
  | description = ''For Those About to Rock'' was the beginning of the band's decline in popularity, with clichéd lyrics, slower tempos, and an arena rock sound.<ref name="popmatters" /> However, it was one of the band's biggest hits, reaching #13 on the UK charts and #44 in the US}}

Amid rumours of alcoholism and drug-induced paranoia, drummer Phil Rudd's friendship with Malcolm Young deteriorated and, after a long period of unfriendliness, the men's dislike for each other grew so strong that they fought. Rudd was fired two hours after the fight.<ref name="acdc.cc" /> Although Rudd had finished most of the drum tracks for their next album, he was replaced by Simon Wright after the band held an anonymous audition.

With the new line-up, the band released a less successful album, the self-produced ''Flick of the Switch". ''Fly on the Wall'', produced by the Young brothers in 1985, was also regarded as uninspired and directionless.<ref></ref> A music concept video of the same name featured the band at a bar, playing five of the album's ten songs.

In 1986, the group returned to the charts with the made-for-radio "Who Made Who". The album ''Ride On", with newer songs such as title track "Who Made Who", and two new instrumentals, "D.T." and "Chase the Ace".

In February 1988, AC/DC were inducted into the Hall of Fame.<ref></ref>
