'''''Hōshō''''' (Japanese: 鳳翔, meaning "flying phoenix") became the first flat-deck aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1921, and was the first purpose-designed aircraft carrier in the world to be commissioned.<ref>"The Imperial Japanese Navy was a pioneer in naval aviation, having commissioned the world's first built-from-the-keel-up carrier, the ''Hosho''." [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ijn.htm Source].</ref> 

Her predecessors in the Imperial Japanese Navy were seaplane carriers such as the ''Wakamiya'' (converted in 1920 to an aircraft carrier with forward launch platform), or the ''Notoro''.

==Development==
The hull of the ''Hōshō'' was based on a cruiser design, but it was not a conversion. She was built from the keel up as an aircraft carrier. ''Hōshō'' was commissioned on ''Hermes'', which was designed before ''Hōshō''. The ''Hōshō'' however was originally conceived as a mixed aircraft carrier and seaplane tender and only during construction was her design modified to a dedicated carrier. She was the first purpose-designed aircraft carrier, but not the first purpose-designed dedicated aircraft carrier. (See ''aircraft carrier'' for more on the type's history).

Her design was originally based on a cruiser-style hull, a flight deck with a depressed fore-part to accelerate lift-off, a starboard island, and three starboard funnels that were reclinable during flight operations. After trials she was improved by removing the island and flattening the flight deck, giving her a flush-deck design.

==Operations==
Being the first of its kind in the navy, ''Hōshō'' was actively used to develop the aircraft carrier operational methods and tactics of the Japanese Navy during the 1920s. She was preceded by the 1913 early aircraft carrier ''Wakamiya'', which contributed to the development of the carrier techniques used in the ''Hōshō''.

She served during the Shanghai Incident (bombing of Sino-Japanese War in 1937. In August-December 1937, ''Hōshō'' supported land operations of the Japanese Army in China, as part of Carrier Division 1 with ''Ryūjō''. Her aircraft complement consisted of nine Nakajima A2N fighters and six Yokosuka B3Y1 attack planes.

By the beginning of Yokosuka B4Y1 'Jean' torpedo bombers. [http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq81-6.htm] 

For most of the postwar years, the assumption was made in English-language publications that the ship had been equipped with a 'modern' aircraft complement by the time of the Midway operation, on the basis of minimal translations published in English.  However, beginning in the 1980s English-language researchers realized that this was a bad assumption, as Japanese official histories and air orders of battle began to appear. It has now become clear that at the time of Midway, ''Hōshō'' still carried a complement of the fixed landing gear biplane torpedo planes, the  Yokosuka B4Y1 'Jean'. It was one of these aircraft which took the photos of the burning, drifting Hiryu in the late afternoon of June 41942.

Efforts were made to lengthen and widen her flight deck, but the overhang weakened her stability and ocean-going capability. She was relegated to training duty in Japan's Inland Sea after 1943.

==Post-War fate==
After the war, she was used as a transport to repatriate Japanese personnel from abroad until June 1946. Hōshō was one of four carriers of the Japanese Navy to survive the war, but would be scrapped in 1947.

''Hōshō'' air group: 
*1932: 9 fighters A1N1 (Type 3), 3 B1M2 (Type 13), 3 reconnaissance aircraft C1M (Type 10) (15 aircraft)
*1937: 9 fighters A4N1 (Type 95), 6 bombers B3Y1 (Type 92) (15)
*1941: 11 fighters A5M4 'Claude', 8 bombers B4Y1 'Jean' (19)
*1942: 8 bombers  B4Y1 'Jean' (8)

thumb|350 px|left|Le ''Hosho'' pendant ses premiers essais à la mer, début 1923. L'ilôt sera supprimé plus tard.
'''Hosho''' (japonais : 鳳翔, "phoenix volant") fut le premier porte-avions de la marine impériale japonaise.

Le ''Hosho'' fut mis en service le 27 décembre 1922, devenant ainsi le premier bâtiment de guerre au monde à avoir été conçu pour remplir le rôle de porte-avions (le ''HMS Hermes'' britannique, dont la conception était antérieure à celle du ''Hosho'', n'entrera en service qu'en 1924).

Son dessin était basé sur une coque de type croiseur, avec un pont d'envol plongeant à l'avant pour faciliter le décollage, un îlot décalé sur tribord et trois cheminées à retractables pendant les opérations aériennes. Après les essais en mer, l'îlot fut supprimé et le pont d'envol devint entièrement plat, donnant au bâtiment une silhouette caractéristique.

==Operations==

Etant le premier navire de ce type, le ''Hosho'' fut employé intensivement afin de développer les modes opératoires de l'aéronavale japonaise.
