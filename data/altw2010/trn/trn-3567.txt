'''ジャスティン・ローズ'''（'''Justin Rose''', プロゴルファーである。南アフリカ・マスターズ・トーナメント5位、世界ランキング自己最高位を7位に上げた（2007年11月4日付）。[http://dps.twiihosting.net/wgr/doc/content/archive/2007/owgr44f2007.pdf] 彼のゴルフ経歴は、同年代のライバル選手たちほど順風満帆でない時期もあったが、その中で着実な成長を続けてきた選手である。

ローズは生後11ヶ月から南アフリカから全英オープンゴルフ（ロイヤル・バークデール・ゴルフクラブ、パー70）でいきなり4位入賞を果たし、ここで一躍世界の注目を集めた。イーブンパー（E, 280ストローク）で並んだマーク・オメーラとブライアン・ワッツがプレーオフを戦い（オメーラが優勝）、1打差の単独3位にタイガー・ウッズがつけ、ローズは 2 オーバーバー（+2, 282ストローク）で4位に入った。大会終了の翌日、ローズは18歳を迎える直前にプロ転向を宣言したが、その後のキャリアは決して順調ではなかった。

'''Justin Peter Rose''' (born English professional golfer. 

Rose was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and moved to the United Kingdom at the age of five.

Rose burst to prominence at The Open Championship in 1998. As a seventeen year old amateur he holed a dramatic shot from the rough for birdie on the 18th to finish tied for fourth. He turned professional the following week, but initially struggled badly, missing 21 cuts in a row.

Rose's career soon began to take off, however, and he became established on the European Tour. He won his first professional event, the Dunhill Championship in South Africa, in 2002, and followed this up with three further victories in that year. In 2003, he reached number 33 in the Official World Golf Rankings. In 2004, he played mainly in America on the PGA Tour, while also maintaining his membership of the European Tour. He did not have a good year, and slipped out of the top 50 in the world rankings. 

His ranking continued to fall in early 2005, and in March he announced that he was quitting the European Tour and concentrating on playing in the U.S. This had no apparent effect on his poor form, and by the middle of the year he had fallen out of the World Top 100. In August of that year he made an about face by announcing his intention to return to the European Tour. Later the same week he had his best result of the year, leading the Buick Championship after three rounds before slipping to a third place finish. One or two further good results followed late in the 2005 season, and he stayed on the PGA Tour after all. 

In September 2006 at the 2007 Masters has seen him surpass his previous best world ranking, by reaching number 26 on 8 April 2007.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/6538677.stm Rankings boost for Augusta king], ''bbc.co.uk'', 9 April 2007</ref>

He lost in a playoff at the 2007 BMW PGA Championship, but moved into the top twenty of the World Rankings for the first time, and by October had reached a new career high of 12 and became the top ranked British golfer. Rose won the European Tour Order of Merit title for 2007 in a thrilling climax to the season at the Volvo Masters, which he won in a playoff on 4 November.  His new world ranking of number 7 made him the top-ranked European golfer for the first time,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/7077879.stm Rose claims Order of Merit title], ''bbc.co.uk'', 4 November 2007</ref> and he has since moved up to sixth in the rankings.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/7136687.stm Rose continues to climb rankings]''bbc.co.uk'', 10 December 2007</ref>

Rose married long-time girlfriend Kate Phillips, a British former international gymnast, in December 2006. They have a house in Lake Nona, Florida, and a riverside flat in the London suburb of Putney.
