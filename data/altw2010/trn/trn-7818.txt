'''Maurice Harold Macmillan''' (okunuşu: ''Moris Herıld Makmillın'') (10 Şubat 1894 – 29 Aralık 1986), Muhafazakâr Parti üyesi İngiliz siyasetçi, 1957-1963 arası Birleşik Krallık başbakanı.

Macmillan'ın ilk icraatlarından biri, Kıbrıs'ta hapisteki başpiskopos Makarios'u serbest bırakmak oldu. Bu, İngiltere'nin Kıbrıs sömürgesindeki katı siyasetinden vaz geçmesinin ilk sinyaliydi. 19 Haziran 1958'de açıklanan Macmillan planı, yedi yıllık bir geçiş dönemi çerçevesinde adaya siyasi otonomi tanıyordu, adadaki Türklerin ve Rumların siyasi haklarını belirliyordu.

Amerikan nükleer füzelerinin İngiltere'de konumlandırılması böylece ülkesinin nükleer caydırıcılık kazanması için ABD ile müzakere yaptı. 1962'de Nassau Antlaşması ile Polaris füzelerini almayı başardı. Bu anlaşmaya kızan Fransa başkanı de Gaulle, İngiltere'nin AET üyeliğini veto etti.

İngiltere, ABD ve SSCB arasında 1962'de imzalanan Nükleer Testlerin Kısmen Yasaklanması antlaşmasının mimarlarındandı.

Macmillan, Süveyş Krizi sonrasında soğuyan ABD-İngiltere ilişkilerini düzeltmek için çaba harcadı ve başarı sağladı. Avrupa ülkelerine yakınlaştı, AET'ye geç de olsa üye olmak için çaba gösterdi. Başbakanlığı döneminde Afrika'daki İngiliz sömürgeleri bağımsızlıklarını kazanmaya başladılar. 1957'de Gana, 1960'da Nijerya ve 1963'de Kenya bağımsız oldu. Ancak Ortadoğu'daki İngiliz siyaseti müdahaleci olmaya devam etti. Irak'a ve Umman'a müdahale edildi.

Macmillan'ın ekonomideki başarısı, 1959 yılındaki genel seçimleri Muhafazkârların kazanmasını sağladı.

'''Maurice Harold Macmillan, 1st Earl of Stockton''', OM, PC (British Conservative politician and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 10 January 1957 to 18 October 1963. 

Nicknamed 'Supermac', he did not use his first name and was known as '''Harold Macmillan''' before elevation to the peerage. When asked what represented the greatest challenge for a statesman, Macmillan replied: “Events, my dear boy, events”.<ref>[http://www.policyreview.org/oct05/bering.html Never Had It So Good: A History of Britain from Suez to the Beatles.]</ref>

==Early life==
Harold Macmillan was born at 52 Cadogan Place in Chelsea, Scottish crofter who founded Macmillan Publishers. 

Macmillan was first educated at Eton but was expelled - according to Woodrow Wyatt - for buggery, though an alternative version is that he left due to illness.<ref>Ball, Simon "The Guardsmen, Harold Macmillan, Three Friends and the World They Made", (London, Harper Collins), 2004</ref> He also attended Balliol College, Oxford, although he only completed two years of his classics degree before the outbreak of the First World War. 

Macmillan served with distinction as a captain in the Greek playwright Aeschylus in his original language.<ref></ref> 

Macmillan lost so many of his fellow students during the war that afterwards he refused to return to Oxford, saying the university would never be the same. He joined Macmillan Publishers as a junior partner in 1920, remaining with the company until his appointment to ministerial office in 1940.

==Marriage==
Macmillan married Liberal Party in the 1870s, and a close colleague of Lord Salisbury. Lady Dorothy was also descended from Newcastle and Pitt the Elder. Her nephew Kathleen, a sister of John F. Kennedy. Between 1929 and 1935 Lady Dorothy had a long affair with the Conservative politician Robert Boothby, in full public view of Westminster and established society. Boothby was widely rumoured to have been the father of Macmillan's youngest daughter Sarah. The stress caused by this may have contributed to Macmillan's nervous breakdown in 1931. <ref></ref> Lady Dorothy died on 21 May 1966, aged 65. 

The Macmillans had four children:
*Maurice Macmillan, Viscount Macmillan of Ovenden (1921-1984)
*Lady Caroline Faber (born 1923)
*Lady Catherine Amery (1926-1991)
*Sarah Macmillan (1930-1970)

===Brother-in-law===
On Edward Cavendish, the 10th Duke of Devonshire had a heart attack and died in the presence of John Bodkin Adams, the suspected serial killer. Thirteen days before, Edith Alice Morrell, another patient of Adams, had also died. Adams was tried in 1957 for her murder but controversially acquitted. Political interference has been suspected<ref>Rodney Hallworth, Mark Williams, "Where there's a will... The sensational life of Dr John Bodkin Adams", 1983, Capstan Press</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">Cullen, Pamela V., "A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams", London, Elliott & Thompson, 2006, ISBN 1-904027-19-9</ref> and indeed, the case was prosecuted by a member of Macmillan's cabinet, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller. Home office pathologist Francis Camps linked Adams to a total of 163 suspicious deaths.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

===Eileen O’Casey===
Eileen (née Eileen Kathleen Reynolds), the actress wife of Irish dramatist Sean O’Casey, had a close relationship with Harold Macmillan, who had published her husband’s plays.

According to an obituary notice of Eileen O’Casey by Edward Marriott, published in the London Evening Standard on 18 April 1995: “It was the death of Sean O’Casey, in 1964. and of Dorothy Macmillan, two years later, that cemented Macmillan and Eileen’s intimacy. She became the light which illuminated his twilight years, eventually even replacing Dorothy in his affections.”

Macmillan’s biographer Garry O'Connor <ref>Sean O’Casey: A Life by Garry O’Connor, Hodder and Stoughton (1988)  ISBN 0340385987</ref> noted that “Eileen was the first woman whom Macmillan asked to sit in Lady Dorothy’s place at table in Birch Grove; he also took her out frequently to dine at Buck’s Club."

Eileen’s obituary in Alec Home was a bit annoyed with me.”

==Political career (1924-1957)==
Elected to the House of Commons in 1924 for Stockton-on-Tees, Macmillan lost his seat in 1929, only to return in 1931. He spent the 1930s on the backbenches, with his anti-appeasement ideals and sharp criticism of Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain serving to isolate him.

During this time (1938) he published the first edition of his book ''The Middle Way'', which advocated a broadly centrist political philosophy both domestically and internationally.

In the Second World War he at last attained office, serving in the wartime coalition government in the Ministry of Supply and the Colonial Ministry before attaining real power upon being sent to North Africa in 1942 as British government representative to the Allies in the Mediterranean. During this assignment Macmillan worked closely with US General Dwight Eisenhower, a friendship that would prove crucial in his later career. 

He was the senior British Operational Officer responsible for Operation Keelhaul, also known as the Betrayal of the Cossacks, the forced, and violent repatriation of tens of thousands of refugees from Russia and Yugoslavia to Tito's Yugoslavia in 1945. He is quoted as saying "Since these men will no longer be treated as prisoners, the Geneva Conventions will no longer apply." <ref>http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/yugoslav-hist1.htm</ref>

Macmillan returned to England after the war and was Bromley. 

With the Conservative victory in 1951 he became Minister of Defence from October 1954. By this time he had lost the wire-rimmed glasses, toothy grin and brylcreemed hair of wartime photographs, and instead grew his hair thick and glossy, had his teeth capped and walked with the ramrod bearing of a former Guards officer - acquiring the distinguished appearance of his later career.

He then served as Foreign Secretary in April-December 1955 and Chancellor of the Exchequer 1955-1957 under Anthony Eden. In the latter job he insisted that Eden's de facto deputy Rab Butler not be treated as senior to him, and threatened resignation until he was allowed to cut bread and milk subsidies. During the Suez Crisis, according to Shadow Chancellor Harold Wilson, MacMillan was "First In, First Out" : first very supportive of the invasion, then a prime mover in Britain's withdrawal in the wake of the financial crisis.

Harold Macmillan became Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party after Eden's resignation in January 1957, surprising observers with his appointment over the favourite, Rab Butler. He was nicknamed Victor 'Vicky' Weisz. It was intended as mockery, but backfired, coming to be used in a neutral or friendly fashion. Weisz tried to label him with other names, including "Mac the Knife" at the time of widespread cabinet changes in 1962, but none of these caught on.

==Prime Minister (1957-1963)==
===Government===<!-- This section is linked from Aldous Huxley -->
The situation with Suez was so desperate that when Macmillan became Queen Elizabeth II he could not guarantee his government would last "six weeks".<ref>Macmillan, Harold, "The Macmillan Diaries, The Cabinet Years, 1950-1957", ed. Peter Catterall (London, Macmillan, 2003)</ref>

Macmillan populated his government with many who had studied at the same school as him: he filled government posts with 35 former Etonians, 7 of whom sat in Cabinet.<ref>David Butler, Twentieth Century British Political Facts 1900-2000, Macmillan, 8th edition, 2000</ref> 

He was also devoted to family members: when Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire was later appointed (Minister for Colonial Affairs from 1963 to 1964 amongst other positions) he described his uncle's behaviour as "the greatest act of nepotism ever".<ref name="autogenerated1" />

===Election victory (1959)===
Macmillan led the Conservatives to victory in the October 1959 general election, increasing his party's majority from 67 to 107 seats. The successful campaign was based on the economic improvements achieved, the slogan "Life's Better Under the Conservatives" was matched by Macmillan's own remark, ''"indeed let us be frank about it &ndash; most of our people have never had it so good."'' 
<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/20/newsid_3728000/3728225.stm Harold MacMillan, Speech in Bedford, 20 July 1957</ref>, usually paraphrased as "You've never had it so good". 

Critics contended that the actual economic growth rate was weak and distorted by increased defence spending.

===Independent nuclear deterrent===
A succession of prime ministers since the Second World War had been determined to persuade the Americans to share the secret of their nuclear weapons with Britain. 

Macmillan believed that, if Britain could develop an H-bomb on the scale of the Americans', they would treat it as an equal and form an alliance. This led the British government and its armed forces to increase demands on Windscale, Britain's first nuclear power plant, to produce increasing amounts of material for an H-bomb. As a result of these demands, the safety margins of the radioactive materials inside the reactor were being eroded.  This led to the Windscale accident on the night of 10 October 1957, in which a fire engulfed the radioactive materials in the core of Windscale's reactor. Nuclear contaminants travelled up a chimney where a filter blocked some but not all of the contaminated material and a radioactive cloud spread over the UK and Europe.
 
Scientists had warned of the dangers of such an accident for some time but Macmillan covered up the reasons for the accident, blaming workers for "an error of judgement" rather than pressure from his government to produce even more nuclear material (Windscale: Britain's biggest nuclear disaster broadcast on Monday, 8 October, 2007, at 2100 BST on BBC Two). 

Following the technical failures of a British independent nuclear deterrent with the Blue Streak and the Blue Steel projects, and the unilateral cancellation of the Skybolt missile system by US Defence Secretary Robert McNamara, Macmillan negotiated the delivering of American Polaris missiles to the UK under the Nassau agreement in December 1962. (Previously he had agreed to base 60 Thor missiles in Britain under joint control, and since late 1957 the American McMahon Act had been eased to allow Britain more access to nuclear technology. These negotiations were the basis for Peter Cook's satire of Macmillan in Beyond the Fringe).

Macmillan was a force in the successful negotiations leading to the signing of the 1962 Partial Test Ban Treaty by the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union. His previous attempt to create an agreement at the May 1960 summit in Paris had collapsed due to the U-2 Crisis of 1960.

===Economy===
Macmillan's One Nation approach to the economy was to seek high or full employment. This contrasted with his mainly monetarist Treasury ministers who argued that the support of sterling required strict controls on money and hence an unavoidable rise in unemployment. Their advice was rejected and in January 1958 the three Treasury ministers Peter Thorneycroft, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Birch, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, and Enoch Powell, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, resigned. Macmillan, away on a tour of the Commonwealth, brushed aside this incident as "a little local difficulty".

Macmillan brought the monetary concerns of the Exchequer into office; the economy was his prime concern. However, Britain's Liberal MP Jeremy Thorpe said of Macmillan's dismissal of so many of his colleagues, "greater love hath no man than this, than to lay down his friends for his life". 

Macmillan supported the creation of the National Incomes Commission as a means to institute controls on income as part of his growth-without-inflation policy. A further series of subtle indicators and controls were also introduced during his premiership.

===Foreign policy===
Macmillan also took close control of foreign policy. He worked to narrow the post-Suez rift with the United States, where his wartime friendship with Dwight D. Eisenhower was key; the two had a productive conference in Bermuda as early as March 1957. The cordial relationship remained after the election of John F. Kennedy.
