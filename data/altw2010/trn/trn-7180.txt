'''Francisco de Asís Vidal y Barraquer''' (født 3. oktober 1868 i Cambrils nær Tarragona i Spania, død 14. februar 1943 i Foyer Saint'Elizabeth, Fribourg i Sveits) var en av Den katolske kirkes kardinaler, erkebiskop av Tarragona 1919-1943, i eksil siden 1946.

Han ble kreert til kardinal av pave Benedikt XV i 1921, og deltok i konklavet 1922 som valgte Pius XI, og i konklavet 1939 som valgte Pius XII. 

Under den spanske borgerkrig var han en kort stund i fangenskap og hans liv var i fare. Han ble utvist og sendt i eksil av spanske myndigheter i august 1936 og slo seg ned i kartheuserklosteret Farneta ved Lucca i Italia, og tilbragte somrene i Sveits. Kan var katalonier, hadde vært på god fot med de republikanske myndigheter i Cataluna, og hadde nektet å undertegne et fellesbrev fra det spanske bispekollegium under borgerkrigen. Dette var bakgrunnen for at Generalissimo Francisco Francos regjering utviste ham og nektet ham å vende tilbake og lede sitt erkebispedømme Tarragona.
