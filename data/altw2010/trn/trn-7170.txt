Vega'' comme l'étoile la plus brillante de la constellation de la Lyre.

Installés dans un premier temps dans le 17e arrondissement de Paris au 34 boulevard Pershing, face à ce qui est devenu depuis le Palais des congrès de Paris de la Porte Maillot, les ateliers furent ensuite transférés à Levallois-Perret.

Pendant les années 1952 à 1954 Facel produit la carrosserie de la Ford Comète.

L'établissement Duchêne fut le dernier concessionnaire Facel Vega et repreneur de la marque suite à la faillite des établissements Facel SA. À la fermeture de l'usine Facel Vega fin 1964, René Duchêne assura le montage et la commercialisation de plus de 60 petites Facel 3 et de quelques Facel 6.

Pendant plus de 20 ans il assura en premier : le suivi "garantie usine", l'entretien et les pièces détachées de tous les modèles Facel Vega.

'''Facel Vega''' was a French builder of luxury cars.  Their advertising slogan: "For the Few Who Own the Finest".

The brand was created by Chrysler DeSoto Hemi engine; the overall engineering was straightforward, with a tubular chassis, double wishbone suspension at the front and a solid driven axle at the back, as in standard American practice. They were also as heavy as American cars, at about  . Performance was brisk, with an approx  top speed and 0 to  in just under ten seconds.

The bodywork was beautifully styled, making the Facel Vega an enduring classic. Most cars were 2-door hardtops with no centre pillar, but a few convertibles were built. 

The 1956 model was improved with a bigger  Chrysler engine and updated transmission and other mechanicals; in the same year a 4-door model, the ''Excellence'', with rear-hinged doors (suicide doors) at the back and no centre pillar, was also produced. Its pillarless design unfortunately made it less rigid and the handling was thus poorer than the 2-door cars, and they are rare.

1959 models had even bigger engines, a  and later a  Chrysler V8, and were quite a bit faster despite their extra weight.

The final evolution came in 1962 with the Facel II; lighter, with sleeker, more modern lines, substantially faster still and famously ''elegant''.

In 1960, Facel entered the Mercedes 190SL. Facellias were advertised in three body styles: cabriolet, 2+2 coupé and 4-seat coupé — all with the same mechanicals and a 96.5" wheelbase. Styling was similar to the Facel HK500, but with rather elegant (though fingernail-breaking) flush door handles.  Following Facel Vega's demise several of M Daninos's styling cues were "borrowed" by Mercedes Benz.

With the idea of creating a mass produced all-French sports car competing with the Alfa Romeos, Facel eschewed its standard of American engines, and the Facellia used a 4 cylinder 1.6&nbsp;L DOHC engine built in France by Paul Cavalier of Pont-à-Mousson. The engine had only two bearings supporting each camshaft, using special steels, as opposed to the usual four or five. Despite the metallurgical experience of Pont-à-Mousson, this resulted in excessive flex, timing problems and frequent failures. The engine was pronounced a disaster and the Facellia with it. The troublesome engine was replaced with a Volvo P1800 powerplant in the Facel III, but the damage was done. Production was stopped in 1963 and despite the vision of it being a "volume" car only 1100 were produced, which is Facel's highest production number. Facel lost money on every car they built, the luxury car side of the company being supported entirely by the other work done by Facel Metallon, Jean Daninos's obsession being very similar to that of David Brown of Aston Martin.
