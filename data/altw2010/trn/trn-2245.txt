'''Sustainable design''' (also referred to as "green design", "eco-design", or "design for environment") is the art of designing physical objects and the built environment to comply with the principles of economic, social, and ecological sustainability. It ranges from the microcosm of designing small objects for everyday use, through to the macrocosm of designing buildings, cities, and the earth's physical surface. It is a growing trend within the fields of architecture, landscape architecture, urban design, urban planning, engineering, graphic design, industrial design, interior design and fashion design.

The needed aim of sustainable design is to produce places, products and services in a way that reduces use of non-renewable resources, minimizes environmental impact, and relates people with the natural environment. Sustainable design is often viewed as a necessary tool for achieving sustainability. It is related to the more heavy-industry-focused fields of industrial ecology and green chemistry, sharing tools such as life cycle assessment to judge the environmental impact or "greenness" of various design choices. 

Sustainable design is general reaction to the global "environmental crisis", i.e., rapid growth of economic activity and human population, depletion of natural resources, damage to ecosystems and loss of biodiversity.<ref name="shu-yang">Fan Shu-Yang, Bill Freedman, and Raymond Cote (2004). "Principles and practice of ecological design". Environmental Reviews. 12: 97–112. [http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?_handler_=HandleInitialGet&journal=er&volume=12&calyLang=eng&articleFile=a04-005.pdf link]</ref> The appearance is that our growing use of the earth has exceeded the sustainable limits of the earth importantly because of continually increasing investment in diminishing resources.  Proponents of sustainable design generally believe the crisis may be resolved by using innovative design and industrial practices which reduce the environmental impacts associated with goods and services. Green design is considered a means of doing that while maintaining quality of life by using clever design to substitute less harmful products and processes for conventional ones.  

The limits of green design in reducing whole earth impacts are beginning to be considered because growth in goods and services is consistently outpacing gains in efficiency.  As a result the net effect of sustainable design to date has been to simply improve the efficiency of rapidly increasing impacts.  The present approach, which focuses on the efficiency of delivering individual goods and services does not solve this problem.   The basic dilemmas not yet well addressed include: the increasing complexity of efficiency improvements, the difficulty of implementing new technologies in societies built around old ones, that physical impacts of delivering goods and services are not localized but distributed throughout the economies, and that the scale of resource uses is growing and not stabilizing.   'Transformative' technologies are hoped for, but workable options are not yet evident.   Only if the scale of resource uses stabilizes will the efficiency of how they are each delivered result in reducing total impacts.

The motivation for sustainable design was articulated famously in E. F. Schumacher's 1973 book ''Small Is Beautiful''. Finally, green design is not the attachment or supplement of architectural design, but an integrated design process within architectural design.<ref name="plainiotis">Ji Yan and Plainiotis Stellios (2006): Design for Sustainability.

==Principles of sustainable design==
While the practical application varies among disciplines, some common principles are as follows:
* Low-impact materials: choose non-toxic, sustainably-produced or recycled materials which require little energy to process
* Energy efficiency: use manufacturing processes and produce products which require less energy
*Quality and durability: longer-lasting and better-functioning products will have to be replaced less frequently, reducing the impacts of producing replacements
* Design for reuse and recycling: "Products, processes, and systems should be designed for performance in a commercial 'afterlife'."<ref>Anastas, P. L. and Zimmerman, J. B. (2003). "Through the 12 principles of green engineering". Environmental Science and Technology. March 1. 95-101A.</ref>
* Design Impact Measures for total earth footprint and life-cycle assessment for any resource use are increasingly required and available.  Many are complex, but some give a quick and accurate whole earth estimates of impacts.  One is estimating any spending as consuming an average economic share of global energy use as 8000btu/$ and CO2 production of .57kgCO2/$ (1995$) from DOE figures. <ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/carbonemiss/chapter1.html] US DOE 20 yr Global Product & Energy Study.</ref>
* Sustainable Design Standards and project design guides and also increasingly available and vigorously being developed originated by wide array private and organizations and individuals.  There is also a large body of new methods emerging from the rapid development of what has become known as 'sustainability science' promoted by a wide variety of educational and governmental institutions. 
* Biomimicry:  "redesigning industrial systems on biological lines ... enabling the constant reuse of materials in continuous closed cycles..."<ref>Paul Hawken, Amory B. Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins (1999). Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution. Little, Brown.</ref>
* Service substitution: shifting the mode of consumption from personal ownership of products to provision of services which provide similar functions, e.g. from a private automobile to a carsharing service. Such a system promotes minimal resource use per unit of consumption (e.g., per trip driven).<ref>Ryan, Chris (2006). "Dematerializing Consumption through Service Substitution is a Design Challenge". Journal of Industrial Ecology. 4(1).</ref>
* Renewability: materials should come from nearby (local or bioregional), sustainably-managed renewable sources that can be composted (or fed to livestock) when their usefulness has been exhausted.
* Healthy Buildings: sustainable building design aims to create buildings that are not harmful to their occupants nor to the larger environment. An important emphasis is on indoor environmental quality, especially indoor air quality. <ref>Levin, Hal (1995). "Building Ecology: An architect's perspective on Healthy Buildings." Proceedings of Healthy Buildings '95. Accessed at [http://buildingecology.com/article.php  Articles on Building Ecology web site].</ref>

==Conceptual Problems to Solve==
* Diminishing Returns: The principle that all directions of progress run out, ending with diminishing returns, is evident in the typical 'S' curve of  Jevon's paradox.  

* Unsustainable Investment:  A problem arises when the limits of a resource are hard to see, so increasing investment in response to diminishing returns may seem profitable as in the Tragedy of the Commons, but may lead to the collapse.  This problem of increasing investment in diminishing resources has also been studied in relation to the causes of civilization collapse by Joseph Tainter<ref> JA Tainter 1988 The Collapse of Complex Societies Cambridge Univ. Press </ref> among others.  This natural error in investment policy contributed to both the Roman and Mayan collapses, among others.  That 'sustaining development' can be confused with 'sustaining resources', and the global scope of our investment with effects we don't see, however, should be a great concern.  Relieving over-stressed resources requires reducing presure on them, not continually increasing it whether more efficiently or not <ref> [http://forest.mtu.edu/info/ecologyseries/Hollings%201973%20resilience.pdf] Buzz Holling 1973 Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems </ref>

==Sustainable planning==

Urban planners that are interested in achieving sustainable cities use various design principles and techniques when designing cities and their infrastructure. These include Smart Growth theory, walkable, energy-efficient buildings, walkable communities which inherently reduce the need for automotive travel.

Both urban and rural planning can benefit from including sustainability as a central criterion when laying out roads, streets, buildings and other components of the built environment. Conventional planning practice often ignores or discounts the natural configuration of the land during the planning stages, potentially causing ecological damage such as the stagnation of streams, mudslides, soil erosion, flooding and pollution. Applying methods such as scientific modelling to planned building projects can draw attention to problems before construction begins, helping to minimise damage to the natural environment.

Cohousing is an approach to planning based on the idea of intentional communities. Such projects often prioritize common space over private space resulting in grouped structures that preserve more of the surrounding environment.

==Sustainable architecture==

Sustainable architecture is the design of lifecycle of the building (heating, electricity use, carpet cleaning etc) This design practice emphasizes efficiency of heating and cooling systems, alternative energy sources such as solar hot water, appropriate building siting, reused or recycled building materials, on-site power generation (solar technology, ground source heat pumps, wind power), rainwater harvesting for gardening and washing, and on-site waste management such as green roofs that filter and control stormwater runoff. Sustainable architects design with sustainable living in mind.<ref> Holm, Ivar (2006).

ISBN 8254701741.</ref>

==Sustainable landscape architecture==

'''Sustainable landscape architecture''' is a category of sustainable design concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space. Design techniques planting trees to shade buildings from the sun or protect them from wind, using local materials, on-site composting and chipping to reduce greenwaste hauling, and also may involve using drought-resistant plantings in arid areas (xeriscaping)and buying stock from local growers to avoid energy use in transportation.

==Sustainable graphic design==

'''Sustainable graphic design''' considers the environmental impacts of graphic design products (such as packaging, printed materials, publications, etc.) throughout a life cycle that includes: raw material; transformation; manufacturing; transportation; use; and disposal. Techniques for sustainable graphic design include: reducing the amount of materials required for production; using paper and materials made with recycled, post-consumer waste; printing with low-VOC inks; and using production and distribution methods that require the least amount of transport.
