Ancient Egyptian religion was polytheistic and often zoomorphic. 
The Egyptian term for god was '''' (''''; also transliterated '''', ''''). The hieroglyphs for these terms R8) are depicted as flags followed by an appropriate gender symbol.

The deified after death, and bore the title of '''' "the good god," if male. The title, "servant of god" was used for the religious leaders in the temples of gods, '''' was applied to priestesses and '''' was applied to priests, with parallel constructions for goddesses, the religious leaders of their temples, and for dead pharaohs who were women.  

The term, ''hemt-nṯr-nt imen''  "servant of the god, wife of Amun" was a title held by priestesses in the tenth (2,160 BCE) and twelfth (1991-1802 BCE) dynasties (Shafer, p 14), which was adopted by the female members of the royal family in the New Kingdom (the hereditary, royal lineage of Egypt was a New Kingdom is dated from 1,570-1,070 BCE and includes the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth dynasties. The term "god father" '''' was an epithet of Thoth when he became identified as a counterpart to the goddess, Ma'at.

Ancient Egyptian culture persisted. That dynasty was ruled by a Hellenistic royal family for nearly 300 years, from 305 BCE. to 30 BCE, when the Romans conquered Cleopatra VII, the last pharaoh. Roman rule lasted until the final invasion by Muslim Arabs in 646 CE that ended 975 years of Græco-Roman rule over Egypt. During that time religious concepts had blended few aspects from the invading cultures with the native, but retained most of the Egyptian cults and deities for continuity with the long history of a culture that served as the authority for the government, maintained the royal lineage, and interwove their deities with their rulers—along with the developing Christian beliefs among some of the Romans.

== Regional pantheons during the Old Kingdom ==

In the Old Kingdom, the third through sixth dynasties dated between 2,686 to 2,134 BCE, the pantheons of individual Egyptian cities varied by region. Beliefs can be split into five distinct localized groups during that time and which arose later:
* the Heliopolis''', meaning ''the nine'' - consisted of Nut, Seth, Shu, and Tefnut 
* the Ogdoad of '''Hermopolis''', a changing myth which began with eight deities who were worshipped in four female-male pairs; the females were associated with snakes and the males with frogs: Naunet and Nu, Amaunet and Amun, Kauket and Kuk, Hauhet and Huh; first being a cult having Hathor and her son, Ra (and later, Horus as the son of Isis, who was an aspect of Hathor); later changing to a cult where Hathor and Thoth were the main deities over a much larger number of deities; and even later, Ra was assimilated into Atum-Ra through a merger with Atum of the Ennead cosmogeny; in the final version of the creation myth a lotus, a symbol held by Hathor, was said to have arisen from the waters after an explosive interaction, the lotus was said to have opened and revealed Ra, who later became identified as Horus also
* the war, protector, and fertility deity who personified the flooding of the Nile, and Heka, a personification of law

== Later regional pantheons ==
* the triad of '''Thebes''' that arose during the Middle Kingdom in 2134-1991 B.C. 
* the Memphis''', which is unusual because these deities were not associated with each other before this triad was formalized, when beliefs about the Ennead and Ogdoad were merged after Memphis rose to prominence
