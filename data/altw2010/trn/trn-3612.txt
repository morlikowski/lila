The '''University of Lincoln''' is a university in the United Kingdom, founded in its current form in 2001, but with its roots in the 19th century Hull School of Art.

It is located primarily in the city of Lincoln but also has campuses in Riseholme, Hull.<ref></ref>  Its corporate logo is the head of the Ancient Roman goddess Minerva.

==History==

The University of Lincoln started out as the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside, having been created the University of Humberside in 1992 from Humberside Polytechnic.

The University has roots going back to the 19th century. These can be traced back to a number of higher educational institutions in Hull, including the Hull School of Art (1861), the Hull Technical Institute (1893), Endsleigh Training College (1905) and the Hull Central College of Commerce (1930).

All these higher educational institutions not associated with the University of Hull were merged in 1976 to form the Hull College of Higher Education. In 1983 this institution became the Humberside College of Higher Education ("HCHE") when it absorbed several courses in fishing, food and manufacturing which were running in Grimsby.  HCHE gained polytechnic status in 1990, and then in 1992 was one of the many polytechnics in the UK to become full universities.

===Recent history===

The industrial land at the southwest end of Lincoln's city centre. This was to be combined with the existing University of Humberside to form a new University of Lincolnshire and Humberside.

In 1996 when the new, modern campus beside Lincoln's Queen Elizabeth II, it was both the most recently-created University in the UK and an institution with a 130-year history of education in the region.

Lincolnshire School of Agriculture's sites at Riseholme, Caythorpe and Holbeach. Caythorpe was later closed permanently and its activities moved to Riseholme. Courses held in Grimsby were also moved to Lincoln around this time. 

Throughout the 1990s, the University's campus facilities in Hull were considerably scaled down as the focus shifted towards Lincoln. In 2001 this process was taken a step further when the decision was made to move the administrative headquarters and management to Lincoln and to sell the Cottingham Road campus in Hull, the former main campus, to its neighbour, the University of Hull - The site is now the home of the Hull York Medical School.  The University still maintains a smaller campus, the Derek Crothall Building, in Hull city centre. A smaller campus and student halls on Beverley Road, Hull, were also sold for redevelopment.

As a result of these changes, and because the University's double-barrelled name had come to be regarded as unattractive to students, "Humberside" was dropped and the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside was rebranded "University of Lincoln".

On 28 October 2004, following its redevelopment as a specialist Food science technology park, the campus at Holbeach was reopened by John Henry Hayes, the Member of Parliament for South Holland and the Deepings.

More recently the University's Forensic Science department has been one of only four Universities in the UK accredited by the Royal Society of Chemistry, and the department's BSc (Hons) Forensic Science course is accredited by the Forensic Science Society.<ref></ref>

==Campuses==

The University has expanded rapidly on the Brayford site since its opening in 1996. Buildings on the Brayford now include a School of Architecture designed by the British architect Rick Mather, a science laboratory facility, a sports centre, and a university library.

The main academic building on the Brayford campus was designed such that, if the University were to fail, it could be easily converted into a atrium space is surrounded by balconies on several floors, with lecture halls on the ground and classrooms on the higher floors.

The University also maintains several buildings of historic interest in uphill Lincoln (the "Cathedral" campus), including a building named after the Samaritans. At Riseholme, set amongst a  estate and working farm is the former residence of the Bishop of Lincoln. The main building at the much-reduced campus in Hull has been renamed in honour of the late Professor Derek Crothall, a former Pro Vice Chancellor of the University.

===Future plans===

The University has ambitious plans to complete the physical development of the Brayford campus. These plans are detailed in the University's Brayford campus masterplan, and include:

* Landscaping to create two public squares and a formal pond with surrounding lawns (underway in 2008)
* A second phase of development at Sparkhouse Studios (starts 2008)
* A second science building
* A dedicated building for the Faculty of Business and Law
* A 5,000 m² extension to the Great Central Warehouse University Library

In 2005, the University's halls of residence were leased to a charitable trust for a premium of £30 million. As part of the deal the University would forego the rent that they would have ordinarily received. Part of the £30m will be used to fund the above developments.

==Organisation==

There are four faculties of study: 
*Art, Architecture & Design (Acting Dean: Frances Mannsaker)
*Business & Law (Acting Dean: Professor Andrew Atherton)
*Life & Social Sciences (Dean: Sara Owen)
*Media, Humanities & Technology (Dean: Professor John Simons)

'''The University of Lincoln''' is een van de nieuwste en snelst groeiende universiteiten in het Verenigd Koninkrijk.

==Oorsprong==
Hoewel de universiteit, in haar huidige vorm, pas sinds Hull, waar een aantal onderwijsinstellingen, waaronder de ''Hull School of Art'' (opgericht 1861), ''The Hull Technical Institute'' (opgericht 1893), ''Endsleigh Training College'' (opgericht 1905) en ''The Hull Central College of Commerce'' (opgericht 1930), in 1976 fuseerde om samen de ''The Hull College of Higher Education'' te vormen. In 1983 werd deze instelling omgedoopt tot de ''Humberside College of Higher Education'' (HCHE), aangezien inmiddels veel van de opleidingen buiten Hull zelfs werden onderwezen. En, nadat het een aantal opleidingen in Grimsby had overgenomen, behaalde het de status van polytechnic in 1990. Een wetswijziging in 1992 maakte het mogelijk voor Britse polytechnics om zich om te vormen tot volledige universiteiten. De meeste polytechnics besloten om deze stap te nemen, waaronder ook het HCHE. En zo ontstond de ''University of Lincolnshire & Humberside'' (ULH).

==Recente geschiedenis==
thumb|260px|right|''The Engine Shed'' op de nieuwe campus van de universiteit
Hoewel Lincoln al eeuwenlang een bekende kathedraalstad was in het Verenigd Koninkrijk, had de stad nooit eerder een eigen universiteit. Daarom werd besloten om in 1993 te beginnen aan de bouw van een volledige universiteitscampus op een groot braakliggend terrein ten zuiden van het stadscentrum. In 1996 was de campus klaar en werd deze geopend door Koningin Elizabeth II. 

In 2001 nam de University of Lincolnshire & Humberside de in Lincoln gevestigde opleidingen van Leicester, de ''Lincoln School of Art & Design'' en drie locaties van de ''Lincolnshire School of Agriculture'' over. De opleidingen die de ULH in Grimsby had gevestigd werden in dezelfde periode naar Lincoln verhuist.
Naast al deze veranderingen werd besloten om onder een nieuwe naam verder te gaan. Deze naam werd '''The University of Lincoln'''. Het nieuwe logo van de universiteit werd Minerva, de Romeinse Godin van de wijsheid.

Een nieuw faciliteitencomplex werd geopend op de campus in september 2006. ''The Engine Shed'' bestaat uit 4 bars, twee concertzalen en een aantal cafés en winkels. Ook bevinden zich in het nieuwe pand de kantoren van ''Lincoln Students' Union Co-operative'', de aan de Universiteit gekoppelde, algemene studentenvereniging.
