'''Amazonė''' () - didžiausia Brazilijos valstija, išsidėsčiusi šalies šiaurės vakaruose, Amazonijoje. Šiaurėje ribojasi su Roraimos valstija, rytuose - su Para, pietuose - su Mato Grosu, Akre, vakaruose - su Peru. Valstijos sostinė - Manausas.

== Istorija ==
Pirmieji dabartinę Amazonės valstijos teritoriją pasiekė ispanai, vadovaujami Madrido sutartį teritorija paskirta Pedro II nutarimu įkurta Amazonės valstija. XIX a. vid. kilo kaučiuko bumas, steigėsi įvairių šalių kaučiuko bendrovės. Bumui praėjus regionas nuskurdo. 

== Geografija ==
Beveik visą Amazonės valstiją užima Gvianos plokščiakalnį. Jame yra aukščiausia valstijos ir visos šalis vieta - Neblinos kalnas (2994 m). Klimatas pusiaujinis, ištisus metus karštas ir drėgnas. Svarbiausia upė - Amazonė, su intakais: Negru, Pūrumi, Isa, Madeira.
 
== Ekonomika ==
Medienos kirtimas ir eksportas, tropinių kultūrų (kasavos, apelsinų, vaisių) auginimas. Vaistinių augalų rinkimas. Manause - elektronikos pramonė (mobilieji telefonai, buitinė technika), automobilių gamyba. Turizmas.

== Gyventojai ==
2007 m. Amazonėje gyveno 3,3 mln. gyventojų, iš jų net trečdalis - Manause. Tankiausiai gyvenama Amazonės ir Negro santaka, likusi dalis apgyvedinta itin retai. 74% gyventojų - maišytos rasės (''pardo''), 21% - baltieji, 4,3% - juodaodžiai, 0,4% - indėnai.

'''Amazonas''' (<ref>In state of Brazil in area, located in the northern part of the country. 
Neighboring states are (from north clockwise) Acre. It also borders department Amazonas in Colombia, as well as the Amazonas State, Venezuela (it does not border the Peruvian Amazonas Region).  The prime feature of the Amazon is its immense forest.  This is the largest Brazilian State in area, with 1.5 million square kilometers. From the capital, Manaus, tours take tourists to see the meeting of waters where the rivers Negro and Solimões run alongside without mixing their waters, and stay in the lodges in the forest, appreciated by foreign tourists. Although being far away from the ocean, Manaus is a port city. Among the many attractions of the capital, are the Teatro Amazonas, the Municipal Market, the Zoo, the Forest of Science and the Museum of the Indian. Outside the city of Manaus, beside the meeting of the waters, the main attractions are the tours of the largest biodiversity of the planet, with a fauna of more than 250 species of mammals, 2,000 types of fish and 1,100 types of birds. 

==Geography==
thumb|left|[[Amazon rainforest.]]
Amazonas has a territory covered mostly by rainforest, covering a vast area of Amazon Rainforest. The state is named after the Amazon River. Amazonas is home to the highest mountain in Brazil; Pico da Neblina, a tepui which stands at 2,994 meters above sea level. The state is almost entirely covered by the Amazon Rainforest, 98% according to officials,<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/international/americas/11amazon.html The New York Times article on 2005 drought in Amazonas]</ref> and it is divided into three types of habitat, viz:
*''igapos'' - permanently flooded land, roots of vegetation always submerged
*''varzeas'' - higher than ''igapos'', land is only submerged when rivers are at their highest during the wet season
*low plateau - higher still, never submerged
This wide and varied terrain means that the Amazonas region attracts a large number of tourists.

===Climate===
An equatorial climate is a type of tropical climate in which there is no dry season – all months have mean precipitation values of at least 60 mm.  It is usually found at latitudes within five degrees of the equator – which are dominated by the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The equatorial climate is denoted ''Af'' in the Köppen climate classification.
thumb|160px|[[Victoria_amazonica|Vitória Régia, in Amazonas River.]]  Tropical rainforest is the natural vegetation in equatorial regions.

===Vegetation===
The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world. Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia.<ref name ="Turner 2001">Turner, I.M. 2001. ''The ecology of trees in the tropical rain forest''.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.  ISBN 0-521-80183-4</ref>  As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity. More than 1/3 of all species in the world live in the Amazon Rainforest.<ref>[http://www.worldwildlife.org/wildplaces/amazon/index.cfm Amazon Rainforest, Amazon Plants, Amazon River Animals]</ref>
The largest biodiversity of the planet is present across the State of Amazonas, generating great surprise in its visitors.

==History==
The name "Amazonias" was given to the Amazon River by early Spanish explorers, who fought skirmishes with female Amerindian warriors that they named after the fierce mounted female warriors in Greek mythology. Another, less common version states that the term Amazon comes from a local Amerindian word, ''amassunu'', which means "sounds of the waters".

What is today Amazonas state was first taken control of after the 1494 Portuguese, territories west of (approximately) 46° 37' W belonging to Spain, those east of that longitude, to Portugal.

Originally, most of settlements and large numbers of Portuguese soldiers in the Brazil area.  Spain officially handed over control of the region with the Treaty of Madrid in 1750.  

The state of Amazonas was officially created by Dom Pedro II in 1850.  

The state had an era of splendour in the 1850s, at the peak of the enslaved Amerindian ''seringueiros'' (rubber tappers) died through disease and overwork.

By the late 1800s, the Brazilian rubber monopoly was slowly dying, as British and Dutch plantations in South-East Asia were producing cheaper, superior quality rubber, and by 1900 the Amazonas state had fallen into serious economic decline because of this.  It was not until the 1950s that federal government policy rescued the state from complete financial ruin.

The state capital of Manaus had once been a rich city (it received street lighting and streetcars before London) but had largely fallen into disrepair after the end of the rubber boom. In 1967, the federal government implemented a plan to revive the city, and today the city is the financial centre of the region.

== Demographics ==
thumb|right|[[Manaus the capital.]]
According to the IBGE of 2007, there were 3,351,000 people residing in the state. The population density was 2,1 inh./km².

Urbanization: 77.6% (2006); Population growth: 3.3% (1991-2000); Houses: 819,000 (2006).<ref>Source: PNAD.</ref>

The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 2,489,000 Brown (mixed) people (74.3%), 703,000 White people (21.0%), 144,000 Black people (4.3%), 13,000 Asian or Amerindian people (0.4%).<ref></ref>

Mobile phones: 1.4 million (April/2007); Telephones: 457 thousand (April/2007); Cities: 143 (2007).<ref>Source: IBGE.</ref>

==Economy==
thumb|Amazonas Mall in [[Manaus.]]
The industrial sector is the largest component of GDP at 69.9%, followed by the service sector at 26.5%. Agriculture represents 3.6% of GDP (2004). Amazonas exports: mobile phones 48.7%, others eletronics 19.5%, motorcycles 7.7% (2002). 

Share of the Brazilian economy: 1.6% (2005).

Amazonas' economy was once reliant almost entirely upon oranges, and other agricultural products.

The most recent change in the state's economy is the effort the Brazilian government is making to pursue the development of industries whose main focus will be the exporting of consumer goods.  Due to its geographical proximity to the markets in the northern hemisphere and Amazon countries, like Venezuela, they believe this move will have a great economic impact not only in the north region of Brazil but in the entire country.
