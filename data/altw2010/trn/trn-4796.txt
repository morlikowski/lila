==Competition==
====1984 Summer Olympics====
Joyner-Kersee competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and earned a silver medal in the heptathlon.

====1986 Goodwill Games====
Joyner-Kersee was the first woman to score over 7,000 points in a heptathlon event (during the 1986 Goodwill Games). In 1986, she received the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur heptathlete in the United States. 

====1988 Summer Olympics====
In the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea, Joyner-Kersee earned gold medals in both the heptathlon and the long jump.

The silver and bronze medalists were Sabine John and Anke Vater-Behmer, both of whom were representing East Germany. Five days later, she won her second gold, leaping an Olympic record 24-3.5 in the long jump.

====1992 Summer Olympics====

When the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia began, Joyner-Kersee was not fully recovered by the time the heptathlon started.

She was able to recover well enough to compete in the long jump and qualify for the final, but was in sixth place in the final with one jump remaining.
