Cet épisode est une parodie des films à suspense. Toutes les cinq minutes environ, un jingle fait cesser l'action pour nous amener à des questions sans réponse. 

L'épisode parodie aussi la protestation pour la période d'avortement.

It was voted #5 of "10 South Parks that changed the world".

==Plot summary==
Right as Mephisto is about to announce who Cartman's father is, the electricity goes out, the room is darkened, and two gunshots are fired. As the lights come back on, everyone discovers that Mephisto has been shot, which raises the question: Who shot Mephisto? (Questions like this are comically asked throughout the episode by a narrator, examples being "Who built the pyramids?", "Jimbo boss?") Chef feels his pulse, sees that he is still alive and rushes him to the hospital.

Upon entering the hospital, they meet Dr. Doctor, and a nurse with no arms named Nurse Goodley; they are the only ones working in the hospital. Meanwhile, back in town, the ''Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison, and Kevin to play out a reenactment. Mr. Garrison auditions for himself, but is rejected.

In the hospital, Dr. Doctor finally manages to get Mephisto on a life support system, but has many other patients to tend to. Outside, a terrible snowstorm brews, preventing any other doctors from getting to the hospital.

While shooting the reenactment for the TV show, a tree falls on the power line causing the power to go out. All of the adults are now stuck in a little building until the storm lets up. After only a few minutes, Jimbo comes up with the reckless solution of cannibalism in order to stay alive, since no one has had any food in hours. They choose to eat Eric Roberts first (since "nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts"), who played Kevin in the re-enactment, and later the rest of the production crew (who in fact opposed the very idea).

The power also goes out back in the hospital. Regardless, a plan must be made to put it back on. Dr. Doctor suggests that they split into two teams: team A, consisting of everyone in the room except Kenny and team B, consisting of Kenny.

Kenny's job is to go out, go through the icy sewers, avoiding velociraptors along the way to the generator and reconnect the generator, while Team A's "job" is to go upstairs to a lounge, watch television, and drink hot cocoa, with Dr. Doctor giving advice to Kenny via walkie-talkie (in other words, Kenny has to do all the work himself). Kenny later learns that there is a nice, heated path to the generator, but, to his annoyance, only after arriving. Once Kenny gets to the generator, he discovers that there is no wire connecting the cords, so he decides to make the connection himself to restore the electricity, electrocuting himself in the process.

While all of these events are unfolding, Mrs. Cartman, not feeling as responsible as a mother, goes to an unplanned parenthood clinic seeking an abortion. After being told that it is too late for her to have an abortion, Mrs. Cartman decides to try to change the law by sleeping with her congressman, the governor, and even then-president Bill Clinton. It is after finally legalizing 40th trimester abortions when she learns what an abortion actually is, and that she had the word "abortion" confused with "adoption". Upon realizing her mistake, she decides to tell her son about the whole truth.
