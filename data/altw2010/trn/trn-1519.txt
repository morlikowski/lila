'''Vancouver''' is a city on the north bank of the Clark County.  According to the Washington State Office of Financial Management's April 1, 2008 estimate, the city has a population of 162,400.<ref></ref> It is part of the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area.

The larger city of Vancouver, British Columbia is located 305 miles (491 km) north of Vancouver, Washington. Both cities were named for sea captain George Vancouver, but the Canadian city was not incorporated until 1886, nearly thirty years after Vancouver, Washington, and more than sixty years after the name Fort Vancouver was first used. City officials have periodically suggested changing the city's name to Fort Vancouver, Vancouver USA, or even Old Vancouver to reduce confusion with Vancouver, British Columbia. Washington residents distinguish between the two cities by referring to the Canadian Vancouver as "Vancouver, B.C." Current mayor Royce Pollard is an advocate of the unofficial moniker "America's Vancouver."  

==History==
thumb|left|upright|The Marshall House in [[Officers Row, built in 1886 and later named after George C. Marshall.]]

The Vancouver area was inhabited by a variety of  Native American tribes, most recently the Chinook and Klickitat nations, with permanent settlements of timber longhouses.<ref name = "HOV-Natives"></ref> The Chinookan and Klickitat names for the area were reportedly ''Skit-so-to-ho'' and ''Ala-si-kas,'' respectively, meaning "land of the mud-turtles".<ref>[http://gesswhoto.com/ns-chronology.html gesswhoto.com - Native Sons 1900<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> First European contact was in 1775, with approximately half of the indigenous population dead from Lewis and Clark expedition camped in the area in 1806.<ref name = "HOV-Natives" />  Within another fifty years, other actions and diseases such as measles, malaria and influenza had reduced the Chinookan population from an estimated 80,000 to "to a few dozen refugees, landless, slaveless and swindled out of a treaty."<ref name = "HOV-Natives" />

Meriwether Lewis wrote that the Vancouver area was "the only desired situation for settlement west of the Rocky Mountains." The first permanent European settlement did not occur until 1824, when Fort Vancouver was established as a fur trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company. From that time on, the area was settled by both the US and Britain under a "joint occupation" agreement. Joint occupation ended on June 15 1846, with the signing of the Oregon Treaty, which gave the United States full control of the area. The City of Vancouver was incorporated on January 23 1857 and in 2007 marks its sesquicentennial.<ref></ref>

Based on an act in the 1859-1860 legislature, Vancouver was briefly the capital of the Washington Territory, before being returned to Olympia, Washington by a 2-1 ruling of the territory's supreme court, in accordance with Isaac Stevens' preference and concern that proximity to Oregon might give its southern neighbor undue influence.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

U.S. Army Captain (and future President) Ulysses S. Grant was quartermaster at what was then known as Columbia Barracks for 15 months beginning in September 1852. Soon after leaving Vancouver, he resigned from the army and did not serve again until the outbreak of the American Civil War. Other notable generals to have served in Vancouver include George B. McClellan, Philip Sheridan, Oliver O. Howard and 1953 Nobel Peace Prize recipient George Marshall.<ref></ref>

Army presence in Vancouver was very strong, as the Department of the Columbia built and moved to Vancouver Barracks, the military reservation for which stretched from the river to what is currently Fourth Plain Boulevard and was the largest Army base in the region until surpassed by US Army Signal Corps operated the largest spruce cut-up plant in the world to provide much-needed wood for airplanes. Vancouver became the end point for two ultra-long flights from Moscow, USSR over the North Pole. The first of these flights was performed by Valery Chkalov in 1937 . Chkalov was originally scheduled to land at an airstrip in nearby Portland, OR, but redirected at the last minute to Vancouver's Pearson Airfield. Today there is a street named for him in Vancouver.

Separated from Oregon until 1917, when the ferries, Vancouver had three shipyards just downstream which produced ships for shipyard next to the U.S. Army reserve, which by 1944 employed as many as 36,000 people in a twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week production of LST's, and "baby flat tops". This influx of shipyard workers boosted the population from 18,000 to over 80,000 in just a few months, leading to the creation of the Vancouver Housing Authority and six new residential developments: Fruit Valley, Fourth Plain Village, Bagley Downs, Ogden Meadows, Burton Homes and McLoughlin Heights. Each of these was later incorporated into the city, and are well-known neighborhoods, while the neighboring "shipyard city" of Vanport, Oregon, would be destroyed by the Memorial Day flood of 1948.

In 1956, Willie Nelson moved to Vancouver to begin his musical career, recording "Lumberjack". The single sold fairly well, but did not establish a career. Nelson continued to work as a radio announcer in Vancouver and sing in clubs. He sold a song called "Family Bible" for $50; the song was a hit for Claude Gray in 1960, has been covered widely and is often considered a gospel music classic.

Vancouver has recently experienced conflicts with other Clark County communities because of rapid growth in the area. As a result of urban growth and annexation, Vancouver is often thought of as split between two areas, East and West Vancouver, divided by NE Andresen Road. West Vancouver is home to downtown Vancouver and some of the more historical parts of the city, as well as recent high-density mixed-use development. 

More than one-third of the Vancouver urban area's population has spilled into an unincorporated urban area north of its city limits, including the communities of Hazel Dell, Felida, Orchards and Salmon Creek. If county leaders had approved a major annexation plan in 2006, Vancouver would have passed Spokane to become the state's second-largest city.<ref>[http://www.komotv.com/stories/40936.htm komotv.com]</ref>

===Downtown revitalization===
In 1997 the city of Vancouver decided to dedicate the next 15-20 years to redevelop and revitalize a huge portion of the downtown core. The first projects started in the early 2000s with the construction of many tall condominium structures around Esther Short park and in the Uptown Village neighborhood. The most lauded outside investment was the construction of a Hilton hotel directly across from the park. Currently the city is building a new shopping complex, including a Fred Meyer, just outside of the downtown core. ''The Columbian'' newspaper is in the final stages of building a new seven-story building adjacent to the Hilton. There are plans in the future for a new development along C Street in downtown that would include a new library, a new Marriott hotel and roughly 250 new condominiums, along with other projects remain processing to start:

*Riverwest - Mixed use project which includes a condominiums building, hotel/condominiums building, offices building, and a new main library.
*The Luxe - 6 story offices and condominiums building.
*Waterfront Redevelopment - Which include 10K Residents Envision, Retails, Offices, Parks, and more.
*Prestige Plaza - 6 story building which includes condominiums and offices.

== Geography and climate==
Vancouver is located at 45°38'1" North, 122°36'11" West (45.633743, -122.603011) just north of the volcanic Coast Range, Mount Adams are all visible from somewhere in Vancouver.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 46.1&nbsp;square miles (119.5&nbsp;km²), of which, 42.8&nbsp;square miles (110.8&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 3.3&nbsp;square miles (8.7&nbsp;km²) of it is water. The total area is 7.14% water.

Vancouver lies just north of an April 5, 1972 tornado which rated F3 on the Fujita scale, striking a local school. A F1 tornado stuck on January 10, 2008 just after noon causing moderate damage along a 2-mile path from Vancouver Lake to the unincorporated Hazel Dell area. 

Because of its proximity to Portland, many people who live in Vancouver work in Portland. In 2003, 70% of workers in Vancouver worked in Clark County. Those who live in Clark County and work in Oregon have to pay Oregon's relatively high income tax. (Washington State does not have such a tax.)  Additionally, they may choose to shop in Portland to take advantage of a wider variety of shopping choices, and the fact that Oregon has no sales tax. However, there is a risk in such avoidance because Washington does have a use tax that is due on all purchases made in Oregon that are then returned to Washington. Vancouver residents "shop at their own risk" when attempting to avoid the sales tax in Oregon although the rule is rarely, if ever, enforced and currently there are no checkpoints when crossing back into Washington from Portland.

Because many Vancouver residents work in Portland, Oregon there is typically significant rush hour traffic congestion on two bridges that cross the Columbia River, the Interstate Bridge and the Glenn Jackson Bridge.  In 2006 there were 278,043 weekday vehicle crossings on the two bridges.<ref></ref>

As the old growth forests were depleted and heavy industry left the United States, Vancouver's economy has largely changed to high tech and service industry jobs, with many residents commuting to Portland, Oregon. As of 2007, the largest employers in Clark County are government agencies (including school districts) and Kroger corporation's Fred Meyer grocery stores. Rounding out the list are "high tech" manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, WaferTech, SEH America and labor subcontractors such as Volt Services Group. Vancouver also contains the corporate headquarters for Nautilus, Inc. and The Holland (parent company of the Burgerville, USA restaurant chain).<ref name="vbjbol2007">Vancouver Business Journal ''Book of Lists 2007'', p. 24.</ref> 

Downtown is home to a variety of independently-owned franchise stores.

Vancouver is also increasingly popular with retirees, partially because of its proximity to Portland and Washington's lack of a state income tax.

'''Vancouver''' (auch ''Vancouver USA'' oder ''The Couve'') ist eine US-amerikanische Washington. Die Stadt ist Clark County und gehört der Großregion Pazifischer Nordwesten an. Sie hat 157.493 Einwohner (2005).

== Geschichte ==
Im Jahre 1806 kampierten die Teilnehmer der Lewis-und-Clark-Expedition in dieser Gegend. Lewis schrieb über den Ort, dass er der geeignetste Flecken zum Siedeln westlich der Rocky Mountains sei. Die erste Ansiedlung von Weißen vollzog sich jedoch erst 1825, nachdem Fort Vancouver als Handelshaus der Hudson’s Bay Company errichtet wurde. Vancouver wurde das Stadtrecht am 23. Januar 1857 verliehen. 

Die erheblich größere Stadt Vancouver in Britisch-Kolumbien (Kanada) liegt etwa 400 km nördlich. Beide Städte wurden nach dem britischen Kapitän George Vancouver benannt.

Das kanadische Vancouver wurde erst 1886 zur Stadt, fast 30 Jahre später als das US-amerikanische Vancouver und über 60 Jahre später als Fort Vancouver. 

Die Stadtverwaltung hat mehrmals vergeblich versucht, den Stadtnamen in ''Fort Vancouver'' zu ändern, da es sehr häufig zu Verwechslungen mit der gleichnamigen kanadischen Stadt kommt.

Das westliche Vancouver ist ursprünglich und beinhaltet den Stadtkern. Ost-Vancouver ist eine Mischung aus Wohn- und Gewerbegebieten.
