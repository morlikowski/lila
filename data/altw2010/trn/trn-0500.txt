'''ミハイル・ワシリエヴィチ・ロモノーソフ'''('''<font lang=ru>Михаил Васильевич Ломоносов</font>,Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov''',1711年11月19日(ユリウス暦11月8日)－1765年4月15日(ユリウス暦4月4日)）は、ロシアの科学者、新しいロシア文章語及び文学の創始者。

アルハンゲリスク県の農民の子として生まれ、ラヴォアジエに先立って、金属の燃焼が金属と空気の一成分との結合であることを明らかにする実験を試みたことや、今日の分子と原子に相当する〈粒子〉と〈元素〉の区別を主張したことは科学史上の先駆的な仕事である。

また《ロシア作詩法に関する書簡》（1739年）においては、近代ロシア詩の基礎を確立し、《ロシア文法》（1755年）その他の著作により、ロシア語の科学的研究の端緒を開いた。また、彼の頌詩《ホーチン占領頌》（1739年）、《 エリザヴェータ即位の日に》（1747～49年）により、ロシア文学は真の意味で芸術作品となる。歴史では新しい国家起源説を唱え『古代ロシア史』（1766年）を執筆、画才にも恵まれ有名なモザイク画『ポルタヴァの戦い』などを残した。

ルネサンス人を思わせる彼の多面的な活動は、詩人のプーシキンをして「ロモノーソフ自身が大学である」と言わしめ、ベリンスキーはロモノーソフを「ロシア文学のピョートル大帝」と名づけた。この評言はロシア文学を西欧化し、世界史にふさわしいものとした彼の功績をよくとらえている。

'''Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov''' (<font lang="ru">Михаи́л Васи́льевич Ломоно́сов</font>) ( &ndash; ) was a Russian polymath, scientist and writer, who made important contributions to literature, education, and science. Among his discoveries was the atmosphere of Venus. His spheres of science were natural science, chemistry, physics, mineralogy, history, art, philology, optical devices and others. Lomonosov was also a poet, who created the basis of the modern Russian literary language.

== From peasant to scholar ==

Lomonosov was born in the village of Denisovka (later renamed Lomonosovo in his honor) in the Arkhangelsk Governorate, on an island not far from Kholmogory, in the Far North of Russia. When he was ten years old the young Lomonosov had to help his father, a fisherman, work, but the boy's thirst for knowledge was unbounded. He almost learned by heart the few books he had access to &ndash; and, seeing there was no chance of education at home, he decided to walk to Moscow. 

An opportunity occurred when he was nineteen and by the intervention of friends he obtained admission into the Saint Petersburg with a scholarship. There his proficiency, especially in physical science, again stood out. He also plunged into philological science, learned French and German, and ultimately received a 2 year grant to study in German universities. Upon his return to Russia in 1745, he was appointed professor of chemistry at the Academy itself.

== Foreign education ==

He accordingly went to Marburg University in Enlightenment philosopher of his time, Christian Wolff. Lomonosov studied with Wolff and became one of his personal students; both philosophically and as a science administrator (also a ''forte'' of Wolff), this connection would be most influential for the rest of his life.

At Marburg, he also began to write Günther. His ''Ode on the Taking of Saint Petersburg Academy, which was scanty and sent irregularly.  His circumstances became desperate, and he resolved to leave the country and to return to Saint Petersburg. In 1743, his wife joined him there.

== His achievements ==

When he arrived in Saint Petersburg University, where he ultimately became rector. Eager to improve Russian education, Lomonosov joined his patron Ivan Shuvalov in founding the Moscow State University (later named after him) in 1755. In 1764, Lomonosov was appointed to the position of a secretary of state.

In 1756, he tried to replicate Robert Boyle's experiment of 1673 and concluded that the commonly accepted phlogiston theory was false. Anticipating the discoveries of Antoine Lavoisier, he wrote in his diary: "Today I made an experiment in hermetic glass vessels in order to determine whether the mass of metals increases from the action of pure heat. The experiments — of which I append the record in 13 pages — demonstrated that the famous Robert Boyle was deluded, for without access of air from outside the mass of the burnt metal remains the same".

He regarded conservation of matter in the following words: "All changes in nature are such that inasmuch is taken from one object insomuch is added to another. So, if the amount of matter decreases in one place, it increases elsewhere. This universal law of nature embraces laws of motion as well, for an object moving others by its own force in fact imparts to another object the force it loses" (first articulated in a letter to mechanical explanation of gravitation.

Lomonosov was the first person to record the mercury and to hypothesize the existence of an atmosphere on Venus based on his observation of the Petersburg. Believing that nature is subject to regular and continuous organic origin of soil, peat, coal, petroleum and amber. In 1745, he published a catalogue of over 3,000 minerals, and in 1760, he explained the formation of icebergs.
