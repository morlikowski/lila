Ein '''Antiseptikum''' ist ein Desinfektionsmittel und damit ein chemischer Stoff, der in der Medizin eingesetzt wird, um eine Wundinfektion und in weiterer Folge eine Sepsis zu verhindern. 

== Anforderungen ==
Zu diesem Zweck müssen verschiedenste Krankheitserreger mit ausreichender Sicherheit rasch abgetötet werden, ohne den Patienten selbst zu schädigen. 

Ein Antiseptikum soll somit ein möglichst breites allergisierenden Potenzial und eine möglichst geringe systemische Toxizität aufweisen. Antiseptika können bakterizid, bakteriostatisch, fungizid und fungistatisch wirken. Im Weiteren soll es sich durch eine gute Haltbarkeit und eine möglichst geringe Geruchsbelästigung auszeichnen.

== Wirkungsmechanismus ==
Antiseptika wirken durch Proteinfällung, Herabsetzung von Oberflächenspannungen und Wechselwirkungen mit dem Erregerstoffwechsel.

== Stoffgruppen ==
=== Alkohole ===
Von den Alkoholen können Ethanol, Hexanol, n-Propanol und iso-Propanol als Antiseptika eingesetzt werden.

Ethanol besitzt sein Wirkungsoptimum bei 70 bis 80 %, da ein bestimmter Wassergehalt für die bakterizide Wirkung notwendig ist. Da Alkohol schnell wirkt und auch Tuberkelbazillen innerhalb einer Minute abgetötet werden, handelt es sich hier um ein ideales Mittel zur Händedesinfektion, wobei allerdings immer nur so viel der Substanz verwendet werden soll, dass die schützende Fettschicht der Haut nicht weggewaschen wird. Der große Nachteil von Alkohol auf offenen Wunden: Er brennt.

=== Quartäre Ammoniumverbindungen ===
*Benzalkonium
*Cetrimid
*Cetylpyridiniumchlorid
*Octenidin
*Polyhexanid

=== Iodhaltige Verbindungen ===
*Povidon-Iod
*Iodtinktur

=== Halogenierte Verbindungen ===
*Triclosan
*Chlorhexidin

=== Chinolin Derivate ===
*Oxichinolin

=== Phenol Derivate ===
*Triclosan

'''Antiseptics''' (from Greek ''αντί'' - ''anti'', '"against" + ''σηπτικός'' - ''septikos'', "putrefactive") are antimicrobial substances that are applied to living tissue/skin to reduce the possibility of infection, sepsis, or putrefaction. They should generally be distinguished from ''antibiotics'' that destroy bacteria within the body, and from ''disinfectants'', which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects. Some antiseptics are true ''germicides'', capable of destroying microbes (bacteriocidal), whilst others are bacteriostatic and only prevent or inhibit their growth. '''Antibacterials''' are antiseptics that only act against bacteria.

==Use in surgery==

The widespread introduction of antiseptic surgical methods followed the publishing of the paper ''Joseph Lister, inspired by Louis Pasteur's germ theory of putrefaction. In this paper he advocated the use of carbolic acid (phenol) as a method of ensuring that any germs present were killed. Some of this work was anticipated by: 
*Dr. George H Tichenor who experimented with the use of alcohol on wounds ca. 1861-1863, and subsequently marketed a product for this purpose known as "Dr. Tichenor's Patent Medicine " after the US Civil War.
*Ignaz Semmelweis who published his work "The Cause, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever" in 1861, summarizing experiments and observations since 1847.<ref></ref>
*Royal Commission on the Health of the Army (1856–1857), based on her earlier work
*Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., who published "The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever" in 1843. 
and even the ancient Greek physicians Galen (ca 130–200 AD) and Hippocrates (ca 400 BC). There is even a Sumerian clay tablet dating from 2150 BC advocating the use of similar techniques.<ref></ref>

But every antiseptic, however good, is more or less toxic and irritating to a wounded surface.  Hence it is that the antiseptic method has been replaced in the aseptic method, which relies on keeping free from the invasion of bacteria rather than destroying them when present.

==How it works==
For the growth of bacteria there must be a certain food supply, moisture, in most cases oxygen, and a certain minimum temperature (see preserving of food and in the ancient practice of embalming the dead, which is the earliest illustration of the systematic use of antiseptics.

In early inquiries a great point was made of the prevention of putrefaction, and work was done in the way of finding how much of an agent must be added to a given solution, in order that the bacteria accidentally present might not develop.  But for various reasons this was an inexact method, and today an antiseptic is judged by its effects on pure cultures of definite pathogenic celicular single helix microbes, and on their vegetative and spore forms.  Their standardization has been affected in many instances, and a water solution of phenol of a certain fixed strength is now taken as the standard with which other antiseptics are compared.

==Some common antiseptics==

*;cationic surfactants (benzalkonium chloride 0.05 - 0.5%, chlorhexidine 0.2 - 4.0% or octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1 - 2.0%).

*;Quaternary ammonium compounds: Also known as ''Quats'' or ''QAC's'', include the chemicals anionic surfactants, such as soaps. Related disinfectants include chlorhexidine and octenidine.

*;Boric acid: Used in suppositories to treat yeast infections of the vagina, in eyewashes, and as an antiviral to shorten the duration of cold sore attacks. Put into creams for burns. Also common in trace amounts in eye contact solution.  Though it is popularly known as an antiseptic, it is in reality only a soothing fluid, and bacteria will flourish comfortably in contact with it.

*;cationic surfactant, similar to Quats.

*;Hydrogen peroxide: Used as a 6% (20Vols) solution to clean and deodorize wounds and ulcers.  More common 1% or 2% solutions of hydrogen peroxide have been used in household first aid for scrapes, etc.  However, even this less potent form is no longer recommended for typical wound care as the strong oxidization causes scar formation and increases healing time.  Gentle washing with mild soap and water or rinsing a scrape with sterile saline is a better practice.

*;alcoholic solution (called tincture of iodine) or as Lugol's iodine solution  as a pre- and post-operative antiseptic.  No longer recommended to disinfect minor wounds because it induces scar tissue formation and increases healing time.  Gentle washing with mild soap and water or rinsing a scrape with sterile saline is a better practice. Novel iodine antiseptics containing povidone-iodine (an iodophor, complex of povidone, a water-soluble polymer, with triiodide anions I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, containing about 10% of active iodine) are far better tolerated, don't affect wound healing negativelly and leave a depot of active iodine, creating the so-called "remanent," or persistent, effect. The great advantage of iodine antiseptics is the widest scope of antimicrobial activity, killing all principial pathogenes and given enough time even spores, which are considered to be the most difficult form of microorganisms to be inactivated by disinfectants and antiseptics.
