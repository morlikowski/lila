The '''Panopticon''' is a  type of prison building designed by English philosopher Jeremy Bentham in 1785. The concept of the design is to allow an observer to observe (''-opticon'') all (''pan-'') prisoners without the prisoners being able to tell whether they are being watched, thereby conveying what one architect has called the "sentiment of an invisible omniscience."<ref>Lang, Silke Berit. [http://graphics.ethz.ch/Downloads/Publications/Dissertations/Lan04.pdf "The Impact of Video Systems on Architecture"], dissertion, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, 2004.</ref>

Bentham himself described the Panopticon as "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example."<ref>Bentham, Jeremy. ''[http://cartome.org/panopticon2.htm Panopticon (Preface)]''. In Miran Bozovic (ed.), ''The Panopticon Writings'', London: Verso, 1995, 29-95.</ref>

==Conceptual history==

:''"Morals reformed — health preserved — industry invigorated — instruction diffused — public burthens lightened — Economy seated, as it were, upon a rock — the gordian knot of the poor-law not cut, but untied — all by a simple idea in Architecture!"''<ref>Jeremy Bentham. ''[http://cartome.org/panopticon2.htm Panopticon]''. In Miran Bozovic (ed.), ''The Panopticon Writings'', London: Verso, 1995, 29-95.</ref> 

Bentham derived the idea from the plan of a Samuel who arrived at it as a solution to the complexities involved in the handling of large numbers of men. Bentham supplemented this principle with the idea of ''contract management''; that is, an administration by contract as opposed to trust, where the director would have a pecuniary interest in lowering the average rate of mortality. The Panopticon was intended to be cheaper than the prisons of his time, as it required fewer staff; "Allow me to construct a prison on this model," Bentham requested to a Committee for the Reform of Criminal Law, "I will be the gaoler. You will see ... that the gaoler will have no salary — will cost nothing to the nation." As the watchmen cannot be seen, they need not be on duty at all times, effectively leaving the watching to the watched.  According to Bentham's design, the prisoners would also be used as menial labour walking on wheels to spin looms or run a water wheel.  This would decrease the cost of the prison and give a possible source of income.<ref>In Miran Bozovic (ed.), ''The Panopticon Writings'', London: Verso, 1995, 29-95.</ref>

Bentham devoted a large part of his time and almost his whole fortune to promote the construction of a prison based on his scheme. After many years and innumerable political and financial difficulties, he eventually obtained a favourable sanction from Parliament for the purchase of a place to erect the prison, but in 1811 after Prime Minister Spencer Perceval (1809-1812)<ref>[http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page158.asp 10 Downing Street — Prime Ministers in History]</ref> refused to authorise the purchase of the land, the project was finally abandoned. In 1813, he was awarded a sum of £23,000 in compensation for his monetary loss which did little to alleviate Bentham's ensuing unhappiness.

While the design did not come to fruition during Bentham's time, it has been seen as an important development. For instance, the design was invoked by hierarchical structures like the army, the school, the hospital and the factory have evolved through history to resemble Bentham's Panopticon. The notoriety of the design today (although not its lasting influence in architectural realities) stems from Foucault's famous analysis of it.

The architecture {{epigraph
| quote = ''incorporates a tower central to a circular building that is divided into cells, each cell extending the entire thickness of the building to allow inner and outer windows. The occupants of the cells are thus backlit, isolated from one another by walls, and subject to scrutiny both collectively and individually by an observer in the tower who remains unseen. Toward this end, Bentham envisioned not only venetian blinds on the tower observation ports but also maze-like connections among tower rooms to avoid glints of light or noise that might betray the presence of an observer''

The Panopticon is widely, but erroneously, believed to have influenced the design of Pentonville Prison in North London, Victorian examples of the Separate system, which was more about prisoner isolation than prisoner surveillance; in fact, the separate system makes surveillance quite difficult.  No true panopticons were built in Britain during Bentham's lifetime, and very few anywhere in the British Empire.

Many modern prisons built today are built in a "podular" design influenced by the Panopticon design, in intent and basic organization if not in exact form. As compared to traditional "cellblock" designs, in which rectangular buildings contain tiers of cells one atop the other in front of a walkway along which correctional officers patrol, modern prisons are often constructed with triangular or trapezoidal-shaped buildings known as "pods" or "modules". In these designs, cells are laid out in three or fewer tiers arrayed around an elevated central control station which affords a single correctional officer full view of all cells within either a 270° or 180° field of view (180° is usually considered a closer level of supervision). Control of cell doors, CCTV monitors, and communications are all conducted from the control station. The correctional officer, depending on the level of security, may be armed with nonlethal and lethal weapons to cover the pod as well. Increasingly, meals, laundry, commissary items and other goods and services are dispatched directly to the pods or individual cells. These design points, whatever their deliberate or incidental psychological and social effects, serve to maximize the number of prisoners that can be controlled and monitored by one individual, reducing staffing; as well as restricting prisoner movement as tightly as possible.

'''Panopticon''' è il idealista, teorico della riforma giuridica britannica e massimo esponente dell'utilitarismo. 

== Ideali==
L’idea alla base del Panopticon (“che fa vedere tutto”) era quella che - grazie alla forma radiocentrica dell’edificio e ad opportuni accorgimenti architettonici e tecnologici - un unico guardiano potesse osservare (optikon) tutti (pan) i prigionieri in ogni momento, i quali non devono essere in grado di stabilire se sono osservati o meno, portando alla percezione (sempre da parte dei detenuti) di un'invisibile onniscienza.
Lo stesso filosofo descrisse il panottico come ''"un nuovo modo per ottenere potere mentale sulla mente, in maniera e quantità mai vista prima"''

Inverso del Panopticon è l'Anopticon

== Struttura==
La struttura del panottico è composta di una torre centrale, all'interno della quale stazionerebbe l'osservatore, circondata da una costruzione circolare, dove sono disposte le celle dei prigionieri, illuminate dell'esterno e separate da spessi muri. Esse erano disposte a cerchio, con due finestre per 
ognuna: l'una rivolta verso l'esterno, per prendere luce, l'altra verso l'interno, in una colonna nella quale si sarebbe collocato il custode. I carcerati, sapendo di poter esser osservati tutti insieme in un solo momento dal custode, grazie alla particolare disposizione della prigione, avrebbero assunto comportamenti disciplinati e mantenuto l'ordine in modo quasi automatico; inoltre la forma carceraria del panopticon prevedeva che ad ogni singolo detenuto fosse assegnato un lavoro, si avviava così il processo di passaggio tra una formula carceraria contenutiva ad una formula produttiva.
In seguito è stato attribuito al concetto di Panopticon un significato più ampio, a rappresentare il rapporto tra il singolo individuo e le regole del sistema sociale in cui esso è inserito.
L'arte, in special modo la letteratura, la pittura ed il teatro, nonché la musica (si veda l'album degli Isis intitolato, per l'appunto, ''Panopticon'') sono state profondamente influenzate da questo nuovo concetto.
