'''约尔格·海因里希'''（德语：''''''，1969年12月6日-），德国前足球运动员，經已退役，司職後衛。

==生平==
這名球員是在弗赖堡展開球員生涯。效力第一季上陣33場，取得7個入球。第二個球季僅效力半季，就於多特蒙德。這次轉會可謂是海因里希正確的決定，蓋因在他效力期間，就隨球隊於1997年以3-1打敗意大利強隊祖雲達斯，贏得歐洲聯賽冠軍盃。

該屆世界盃，為該屆正選之一。其後他登陸佛罗伦萨。不過由於球隊實力所限，意甲期間海因里希顆粒無收。2001年他返回多蒙特，贏得德甲聯賽冠軍。

'''Jörg Heinrich''' (born German football defender.

He started his first-team career at German amateur side Bundesliga side SC Freiburg and started his professional career at the club. He made his Bundesliga debut on August 20, 1994 as a second-half substitute in SC Freiburg's opening match of the 1994-95 Bundesliga season, a 2-0 defeat away against Karlsruher SC. He went on to become a regular in the Freiburg team during his first season with the club and appeared in 33 out of possible 34 Bundesliga matches that season, also scoring seven goals for the club in the league and helping the team to a surprising third-place finish in the Bundesliga that season. He scored his first Bundesliga goal already in his second appearance for SC Freiburg in the league, netting the final goal in the club's surprising 5-1 home victory over FC Bayern Munich.

He appeared in another eight Bundesliga matches for SC Freiburg in the following season and went on to leave the club for Juventus Turin in the Final.

In the summer of 1998, Heinrich moved to Italian club ACF Fiorentina and continued to play there in the following two seasons before returning to Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2000. In two seasons with Fiorentina, he made  57 Serie A appearances and scored five goals for the club in the league. He subsequently played three seasons for Borussia Dortmund, but was a regular only in the first of these three seasons. In 2002, he won another Bundesliga champions title with the club. Between 2000 and 2003, Heinrich made  63 Bundesliga appearances for Borussia Dortmund and scored seven goals for the club in the league. He also participated with Borussia Dortmund in the 2002-03 UEFA Champions League season and made seven appearances in the competition.
