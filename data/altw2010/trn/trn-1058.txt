'''"A Taste of Freedom"''' is the fifth episode of the fourth production season of ''Futurama''.

==Plot summary==

The crew celebrates Freedom Day, a day where you can do anything you want, regardless of the consequences.  Richard Nixon's head unveils the Earth flag "Old Freebie" to celebrate the spirit of the holiday but the flag is eaten by Zoidberg.  Zoidberg feels this is an expression of his freedom on Freedom Day; however, the rest of the crowd sees him as a traitor.  Zoidberg is chased around town and takes cover in his planet's embassy.

Zoidberg is put on trial and the crew hires lawyer Old Man Waterfall to represent him.  Zoidberg, however, is found guilty and sentenced to death when he refuses to apologize publicly.  After Earth's army storms the Decapodian embassy to seize Zoidberg (which constitutes an act of war, since the embassy is technically on Decapodian mud), the Decapodian ambassador to Earth summons the Decapodian military to retaliate.  The Decapodian army easily defeats Earth's defense forces (thanks in no small part to Zapp Brannigan's incompetence, after he hands over the activation codes for the entire global defense network to a thinly disguised Decapodian operative named "Hugh Man") and Earth is enslaved by the crustacean extraterrestrials. 

Zoidberg does nothing to help his former coworkers, claiming that Earth didn't deserve its freedom.  Later, Fry, Bender, Leela, Zapp, and Kif find a heat-seeking missile and launch it toward the Decopodians' newly-constructed Mobile Oppression Palace (a gigantic vehicle left behind by the Decapodians to keep the people of Earth subjugated, as it is much cheaper than an occupation force and just as effective).  However, the palace is "cold-blooded," like the Decapodians themselves, and the palace continues its destructive rampage.  It eventually crushes Old Man Waterfall for standing in its way, whom Zoidberg respected for defending him when no one else would.  Zoidberg then lights a flag on fire and throws it toward the Mobile Oppression Palace, attracting the missile and thus destroying the palace.  Zoidberg is declared a hero and is honored by Nixon at a ceremony, where he unveils a new Earth flag, out of which Zoidberg is allowed to take a bite.  Zoidberg concludes that Earth, not Decapod 10, is now his true home planet.
