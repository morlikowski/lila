| '''Shadow of the Hawke'''
| 1-1
| 1984-01-22
| Donald P. Bellisario 
| Donald P. Bellisario
|-
| colspan="5" | ''(Two-hour pilot, later shown as a two-part episode)'' <br />The brilliant, yet psychotic engineer Dr. Moffet, builds the advanced attack helicopter ''Airwolf'' for a top secret division of the CIA known as "The FIRM". During the initial test flight, Moffet attacks the airbase, steals his creation and takes it to Libya. To get it back, FIRM operative Archangel, who was injured during the attack, tries to recruit ace helicopter pilot Stringfellow Hawke, who now lives as a recluse in a log cabin after the disappearance of his brother St. John in Vietnam. Hawke falls for Gabrielle, one of Archangel's associates, who encourages him to take the mission. Hawke accepts, but only if the FIRM hands over their classified information on the whereabouts of his missing brother. Hawke and his close friend and mentor, Dominic Santini, run the mission to take back ''Airwolf'', discovering Moffet has used it to destroy American targets for the Libyans, and they will not give up their new toy so easily. Eventually they secure the helicopter and Hawke fulfills his part of the deal, but the FIRM is not forthcoming with his brother's information. Unsatisfied, Hawke hides ''Airwolf'' in a desert cave and becomes custodian of the aircraft, vowing not to hand it over until the FIRM finds his brother. 
:*Note: For many years, this opening film was simply known as "Airwolf" or "Pilot" (VHS releases titled it "Airwolf: The Movie"). Only in more recent years, in syndication, has the title "Shadow of the Hawke" been used to distinguish it. 
:*Note: The above mentioned VHS version shuffled and re-edited many scenes (including using footage from the first season episode "Mad Over Miami"), and dubbed in a number of profanities, including multiple instances of "fuck". It also removed a lot of the elements that set the scene for the series, including Hawke and Santini finding a hiding place for Airwolf in the desert, and Hawke refusing to return the helicopter until hard evidence about the fate of his missing brother St. John. 
:*Note: The original television version of the Pilot was rather graphic in some scenes, and included some, such as those mentioned above, and one of Moffet torturing Gabrielle in the desert, which were often removed from repeat broadcasts for being too strong. (Also, in America, syndication versions always have a shorter running time). As a result, the original, complete version of the Pilot was quite rare for many years, until the release of the Season One DVD box set in 2005.
