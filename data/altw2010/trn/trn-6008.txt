==Early life and career==

Shyamalan's mother returned to India to spend the last five months of her pregnancy with him at her parents' home in Chennai (Madras).

Shyamalan spent his first six weeks in Pondicherry and then was raised in Penn Valley, Philadelphia. He attended the private Catholic grammar school [http://www.waldronmercy.org/ Waldron Mercy Academy], which his parents chose for its academic discipline,<ref>Bamberger, Ibid., p. 15</ref> followed by Episcopalian Lower Merion. Shyamalan went on to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, in Manhattan, graduating in 1992. It was here that he made up his middle name.

Shyamalan had an early desire to be a filmmaker when he was given a Super-8 camera at a young age. Though his father wanted Shyamalan to follow in the family practice of medicine, his mother encouraged Shyamalan to follow his passion.<ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/232/000026154/ NNDB] -Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan</ref> By the time he was 17, Shyamalan, who had been a fan of Steven Spielberg, had made 45 home movies. Beginning with ''The Sixth Sense'', he has included a scene from one of these childhood films on each DVD release of his films, which he feels represents his first attempt at the same kind of film (with the exception of ''Lady in the Water'').

Shyamalan made his first film, the semiautobiographical drama ''Praying with Anger'', while still an NYU student, using money borrowed from family and friends.<ref>Bamberger, Ibid., p. 19</ref> It was screened at the Toronto Film Festival on September 12, 1992,<ref name="IMDbAnger">[http://imdb.com/title/tt0105162/releaseinfo IMDb: ''Praying with Anger'' Release Information]</ref> and played commercially at one theater for one week.<ref name="IMDbAnger"/> When the film debuted at the Toronto Film Festival, Shyamalan was introduced by David Overbey who predicted that the world would see more of Shyamalan in the years to come. ''Praying with Anger'' has also been shown on Canadian television. Filmed in Chennai, it is his only film to be shot outside of Pennsylvania.

Shyamalan wrote and directed his second movie, ''associate producers. The drama dealt with a ten-year-old Catholic schoolboy (Joseph Cross) who, after the death of his grandfather (Robert Loggia), searches for God. The film's supporting cast included Dana Delany and Denis Leary as the boy's parents, as well as Rosie O'Donnell, Julia Stiles, and Camryn Manheim. ''Wide Awake'' was filmed in a school Shyamalan attended as a child<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/m-night-shyamalan Answers.com] - Wide Awake</ref> and earned 1999 Young Artist Award nominations for Best Drama, and, for Cross, Best Performance.<ref>[http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms20.htm Young Artists Award] - Past Nominations Listing </ref> Only in limited release, the film grossed $305,704 in theaters.<ref>[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/WIDEA.html The Numbers] - Wide Awake Box Office Data</ref>

==Movies==
===''Praying with Anger''===

''Praying with Anger'' was Night's first work as a young director and was released in 1992.  The movie tells the story of a young man named Dev Raman (played by Shyamalan) who returns to India to explore his heritage. During the course of the movie, Dev learns that his cold and distant father, now deceased, actually cared for him a great deal before his passing. The title of the movie comes from a moment in the film when the protagonist learns that he is able to pray to Hindu deities with almost any emotion except indifference. Upon realizing this, Raman finds he is only able to pray with anger.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

===''Wide Awake''===

''Wide Awake'', Shyamalan's first major feature film, came from a screenplay written by Shyamalan that was purchased by the then up-and-coming independent film studio Miramax.

The film starred Joseph Cross, Rosie O'Donnell, Dana Delaney, Denis Leary, and Robert Loggia. ''Wide Awake'' also featured Julia Stiles in one of her earliest roles as Josh's teenage sister, Nina. The film follows a young boy's search for God after his grandfather dies, a story told quietly, driven by dialogue. 

The film is similar to later Shyamalan films  with a theme of crises of belief, a supernatural sub-plot, and a twist ending that sums up the ideas presented in the film.<ref></ref> Although ''Wide Awake'' was made in 1995, it was not released until 1998 where it grossed a total of only $288,000 against a production budget of $7 million.

Budgeted at $72 million, ''Signs'' grossed $227 million domestically and $408 million worldwide.<ref>[http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=signs.htm Box Office Mojo] - Signs Box Office Information</ref> It was the highest-grossing film as well as the highest opening-weekend gross ($60 million) of Gibson's career as an actor.

The film received a generally positive reception.  Most notably of which was Roger Ebert's four-star review, stating, "M. Night Shyamalan's ''Signs'' is the work of a born filmmaker, able to summon apprehension out of thin air. When it is over, we think not how little has been decided, but how much has been experienced".<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020802/REVIEWS/208020305/1023 RogerEbert.com: ''Signs'' review]</ref>

Shyamalan said in an interview with ''Science Fiction Weekly'' that his choice of Gibson was based in part by the actor's emotional role in the film ''Lethal Weapon'': "I was on my parents' sofa watching the video of ''Lethal Weapon'', and then this guy did stuff emotionally that had no business being in an action movie. ... I completely believed the humanity of a man who was so torn by the loss of his wife that he wasn't afraid of dying, which made him a lethal weapon. ... [W]hen I wrote the movie about a guy who loses faith because his wife has passed away, I felt like that was the guy. And I also like taking an action guy and not letting him be The Guy." 

Shyamalan also said that originally, there was going to be very little music in the film, but that composer James Newton Howard's intense and emotional compositions reminded him of a Bernard Herrmann (Alfred Hitchcock's frequent composer) score and prompted him to change his mind.<ref name="SciFi.com">[http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw8748.html ''Science Fiction Weekly'' (August 5, 2002)]: M.

===''The Village''===

<!-- Unsourced image removed: thumb|200px|left|Shyamalan and [[Bryce Dallas Howard on the set of ''The Village'']] -->
Drawing on ''Wuthering Heights'' after being offered to pen a screen adaptation, Shyamalan went to work on what was originally titled ''The Woods''.<ref>[http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=16151 Ain't It Cool News] - M. Night's WOODS Script Review</ref> ''The Village'' was released in July 2004.  A drama starring Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Adrien Brody, it tells of a small, 19th-century community run by a group of "Elders" who seem to be content in their isolation from the outside world. The village is encircled by a forest said to be filled with mysterious and threatening creatures. Even as an uneasy truce between the villagers and the creatures seems to be falling apart, one villager (Phoenix) starts to question their forced isolation.

With total production costs of $71.6 million,<ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0227061hollywood1.html The Smoking Gun Hollywood by the Numbers]</ref> the film grossed $114.2 million domestically ($50 million in its opening weekend) and a further $142 million in non-USA receipts. Its successful opening weekend in America was followed by a severe dropoff of 67%, and the film is generally considered to be a commercial disappointment. Critical response was mostly negative:<ref name="Tomatoes">[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/village Rotten Tomatoes] - The Village</ref> Desson Thomson of ''The Washington Post'' called it "a bewildering disappointment";<ref name=" Tomatoes"/> Kevin Thomas of the ''Los Angeles Times'' said, "It's tedious instead of provocative and so unconvincing as to be preposterous."<ref name=" Tomatoes"/> Roger Ebert, who had previously praised Shyamalan, called the film "a colossal miscalculation, a movie based on a premise that cannot support it, a premise so transparent it would be laughable were the movie not so deadly solemn. . . . He is a director of considerable skill who evokes stories out of moods, but this time, alas, he took the day off".<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040719/REVIEWS/40719002/1023 :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews :: The Village (xhtml)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Shyamalan expressed a great deal of regret in the way the film was marketed, telling producing partner Sam Mercer, while overseeing the editing of the teaser trailer for ''The Village'' to have been sold as a period romance with a scare only at the end of the trailer. Shyamalan is also said to have thought that the shift in the main theme of faith from his previous films to that of deception resulted in the mixed-negative response.  Citing that his other movies set out to make an audience believe in the supernatural, ''The Village'' set out to do the opposite.<ref>The Man Who Heard Voices: Or, How M.
