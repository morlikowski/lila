''This article is about LDS church hymns in general, for the book, see Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book) ''

The singing of hymns is an important part of worship in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. '''Latter-day Saint hymns''' come from many sources, and there have been numerous hymn books printed by the Church since its organization in 1830.

==Latter-day Saint Hymns Historical Overview==
In July 1830, the Prophet Joseph Smith received a revelation from God for Emma Smith, his wife, wherein she was directed to make a collection of hymns for the Church of Jesus Christ:

<blockquote>
And it shall be given thee, also, to make a selection of sacred hymns, as it shall be given
thee, which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church.
For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer
unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.
(Doctrine and Covenants 25:11-12)
</blockquote>

Due to persecutions and the constant uprooting of the Church in those early days, Emma Smith was not able to fulfill this assignment for several years.  However, in the mean time, other Saints continued to write, arrange, and collect hymns.

The first hymns of the LDS Church were published by William Wines Phelps in June, 1832 in Independence, Missouri.  These appeared as text only (no music) in ''The Evening and the Morning Star'', the Church’s semimonthly newspaper.  Many of these lyrics were written by William W. Phelps, while others were borrowed from various Protestant sources.  The very first of these hymns published by Phelps was “What fair one is this”.

On July 20, 1833 a mob destroyed the Church’s printing office in Independence, and the publication of the ''Star'' was moved to Kirtland, Ohio – the headquarters of the Church at that time.  In December, 1834, ''The Evening and the Morning Star'' was replaced by a new publication: ''The Messenger and Advocate''.  Phelps continued to write and collect hymn texts, with assistance from Frederick G. Williams and others.

==The 1835 LDS Hymnal== 
rightOn September 14, 1835, at a meeting of the High Council and the Presidency at Kirtland, Emma Smith was again counseled to begin compiling a hymnbook:

<blockquote>
It was further decided that Sister Emma Smith proceed to make a selection of Sacred Hymns,
according to the revelation; and that President W.W. Phelps be appointed to revise and
arrange them for printing.
(History of the Church Vol. II p. 273)
</blockquote>

It appears that final publication of the new hymnal may have been pushed back into early 1836.  The book is tiny - just 3" by 4 1/2" in size.  An indication of the poverty of the Saints in Kirtland at that time is that the hymnal was published in "sexadecimal" form, the least expensive publishing format for books in those days: sixteen pages were printed on both sides of a single sheet, which was then folded, cut, and sewn into the leather binding.  Thus, the entire hymnbook could be printed on just four large sheets of paper. The completed hymnal contained ninety hymns, but only the words were included.  As a result, today it is difficult to determine which tunes were used with many of these hymn texts.

Many of the hymns which had previously been published in ''The Evening and the Morning Star'' were inserted into the 1835 hymnal as a block, almost exactly in the same order as their earlier publication.  Eleven of the hymns were also published in ''The Messenger and Advocate'' between December 1834 and January 1836:

Although the book was printed in 1836, it is still referred to as the “1835 hymnal” because of the publication date on the title page.  The Kirtland printing of the LDS hymnbook was probably very small - perhaps 500 copies at most.  Today, original copies of this hymnbook are extremely rare; less than a dozen are known to exist.  On December 5, 2006 an original 1835 LDS hymnal was sold at Christie’s Auction House in New York City for $273,600. [http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,650212769,00.html]

==The Nauvoo Hymnal==  
rightIn 1841 Emma Smith published a greatly expanded version of her 1835 hymnal at Nauvoo, Illinois. This hymnal contained 304 hymns (340 pages before the index), still in words-only format.  These hymnals are also very rare – In 2007, Swann Galleries in New York auctioned one along with a first edition of the Book of Mormon for $180,000.

==The Manchester Hymnal==
In 1840, Brigham Young, Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor published a words-only hymnal for the Church in Manchester, England.  This “Manchester Hymnal”, or "Small Hymnal", as it came to be called, was by far the longest-lived of all LDS hymnals, with 25 editions published between 1840 and 1912.  Over the years, publication of this hymnal moved from Manchester to Liverpool, and finally to Salt Lake City.  As more hymns were added, the book grew from 323 pages in 1840 to 456 pages in the 1905 edition.  However, it was still a words-only hymnal; the tunes were sung from memory.

==The 1844 LDS Hymnal== 
rightIn 1844, G. B. Gardner and Jesse C. Little published a small hymnal in Bellows Falls, Vermont. This unofficial hymnbook is unique in early LDS history, because it was the first LDS hymnal (and the only one until 1889) to include music with the words.  This hymnal includes tunes for 18 of the 90 hymns found in the 1835 hymnbook.  In addition, another 17 hymns were printed without music.  Hymn number one in this hymnal, “The Spirit of God”, may be the very first LDS hymn ever published with musical notation.left

==The Latter-day Saints’ Psalmody==   
After 1844, the first official LDS hymnbook to include music was ''The Latter-day Saints’ Psalmody'', published in 1889.  At that time, many of the familiar LDS hymns that are sung today were finally fixed in place - but not with the tunes that were sung back in 1835.  

The ''Psalmody'' was a conscious effort by the leaders of the LDS Church to develop a hymn style of their own.  Budding composers in the Church were encouraged to submit new tunes to fit the new and old lyrics.  Most of the old tunes were cast aside without ever having been committed to print, and the memory of them was quickly lost.

The ''Psalmody'' was intended to be a supplement to the "Manchester Hymnal".  Each hymn in the Psalmody was cross-referenced by page number to the "Manchester Hymnal", so that either hymnbook could be used during worship services.  

In many respects, the ''Latter-day Saints’ Psalmody'' represented a high-water mark in LDS hymnody.  By today’s standards many of the hymns are quite challenging, even for choirs, let alone congregational singing.  They were very high-pitched, sometimes ascending above the staff to a high g’ or a’ in the soprano parts.  The tenor parts were written on a separate staff above the soprano and alto lines, making accompaniment difficult.  Still, the 330 hymns in the 1889 '''Psalmody''' show tremendous skill in composition and originality.  Ninety-five of them are still in use in the 1985 LDS hymnal, including these favorites:

*The morning breaks, the shadows flee
*High on the mountain top
*An angel from on high
*Awake, ye Saints of God, awake
*We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet
*Come, listen to a Prophet's voice

About half of the new hymn tunes that were composed for the ''Psalmody'' were written by members of the Church Music Committee, which included Evan Stephens, George Careless, Ebenezer Beesley, Joseph Daynes, and Thomas C. Griggs.  These men were accomplished musicians, composers, and Tabernacle Choir conductors.  Many of their ''Psalmody'' hymn tunes have a pronounced "instrumental" feel, as if they were more suited for organ performance than choir or congregational singing.
