'''Mózgowie''' (łac. ''encephalon'') - najważniejsza, centralna część ośrodkowego układu nerwowego u kręgowców znajdująca się w czaszce, w tym u serca, krwi, wyższe funkcje nerwowe (funkcje poznawcze, popędowe, pamięć i uczenie się).

Stopień skomplikowania budowy mózgowia odzwierciedla zazwyczaj stopień rozwoju ewolucyjnego ssaków mózgowie składa się z pięciu zasadniczych części. Są to:
#kresomózgowie (''telencephalon'')
#międzymózgowie (''diencephalon'')
#śródmózgowie (''mesencephalon'')
#tyłomózgowie (''metencephalon'')
#rdzeń przedłużony (tyłomózgowie wtórne, rdzeniomózgowie) (''myelencephalon'' lub ''medulla oblongata'')
Klinicyści często używają uproszczonego podziału:
#półkule mózgu
#pień mózgu

Wyróżnia się trzy opony mózgowia (''meninges encephali''):
#opona twarda mózgowia (''dura mater encephali'') - najbardziej zewnętrzna
#pajęczynówka mózgowia (''arachnoidea encephali'') - środkowa
#opona miękka mózgowia (''pia mater encephali'') - bezpośrednio przylegająca do mózgowia

W mózgowiu występują komory mózgowia (''ventriculi cerebri''):
*w kresomózgowiu dwie komory boczne (czyli komora I oraz II),
*w międzymózgowiu komora III (połączona z komorami bocznymi),
*w rdzeniomózgowiu komora IV (która łączy się z komorą III w śródmózgowiu wodociągiem Sylwiusza)
Komory mózgowia wypełnia płyn mózgowo-rdzeniowy (''liquor cerebrospinalis'') - wodnista, przejrzysta, zasadowa ciecz (wypełnia również kanał ośrodkowy rdzenia kręgowego, jamę podtwardówkową i podpajęczynówkową oraz zbiorniki podpajęczynówkowe).

In animals, the '''brain''' is the control center of the vision, hearing, equilibrioception (balance), sense of taste, and olfaction (smell). 

While all ganglia. Some animals such as cnidarians and echinoderms do not have a centralized brain, and instead have a decentralized nervous system, while animals such as sponges lack both a brain and nervous system entirely. 

Brains can be extremely complex. For example, the human brain contains roughly 100&nbsp;billion neurons, linked with up to 10,000 connections each.

==History==

Early views on the function of the brain regarded it as little more than cranial stuffing. In Ancient Egypt, from the late Middle Kingdom onwards, in preparation for mummification, the brain was regularly removed, for it was the heart that was assumed to be the seat of intelligence. According to Herodotus, during the first step of mummification, "The most perfect practice is to extract as much of the brain as possible with an iron hook, and what the hook cannot reach is mixed with drugs."  Over the next five-thousand years, this view came to be reversed; the brain is now known to be seat of intelligence, although idiomatic variations of the former remain, as in "memorizing something by heart".<ref></ref>

The first thoughts on the field of ancient philosophers, such as medieval psychologists such as Alhazen and Freud and Jung contributing to the field.

==Mind and brain==

The mind-body problem is one of the central problems in the history of philosophy. The brain is the physical and biological matter contained within the skull, responsible for electrochemical neuronal processes. The ''mind'', in contrast, consists in mental attributes, such as beliefs, desires, perceptions, and so on. There are scientifically demonstrable correlations between mental events and neuronal events; the philosophical question is whether these phenomena are identical, at least partially distinct, or related in some other way.

Philosophical positions on the mind-body problem fall into two main categories. The first category is '''dualism''', according to which the mind exists independently of the brain. Dualist theories are further divided into idealism''', claims that only mental substances and phenomena exist. This view, most prominently held by 18th century Irish philosopher Bishop George Berkeley, has few contemporary adherents.

==Comparative anatomy==

Three groups of animals have notably complex brains: the craniates (vertebrates and hagfish).<ref name="butler"></ref> The brain of arthropods and cephalopods arises from twin parallel nerve cords that extend through the body of the animal. Arthropods have a central brain with three divisions and large ''optical lobes'' behind each eye for visual processing.<ref name="butler"/>

The brain of craniates develops from the anterior section of a single dorsal nerve cord, which later becomes the spinal cord.<ref name="kandel"></ref> In craniates, the brain is protected by the bones of the skull.

In vertebrates, increasing phylogenetic and evolutionary tree. Primitive vertebrates such as fish, reptiles, and amphibians have fewer than six layers of neurons in the outer layer of their brains. This cortical configuration is called the allocortex (or heterotypic cortex).<ref name="martin"></ref>

[This is probably utterly outdated if not outright bullshit. At least the wording needs to be revised - there is no "high" and "low" in phylogeny except for Intelligent Design advocates and other teleologists]

sulci, while the spaces between the folds are called gyri.

In birds, the part of the brain that functionally corresponds to the neocortex is called nidopallium and derives from a different part of the brain. Some birds (like corvids and parrots), are thought by some to have high intelligence, but even in these, the brain region that forms the mammalian neocortex is in fact almost entirely absent.

Although the general embryological divisions of the brain, the location of specific gyri and sulci, primary sensory regions, and other structures differs between species.

===Insects===
In insects, the brain has four parts, the smell, and the central body complex. In some touch receptors on the head and antennae. The antennal lobes of flies and moths are quite complex.

===Cephalopods===
In cephalopods, the brain has two regions: the supraesophageal mass and the subesophageal mass,<ref name="butler"/> separated by the esophagus. The supra- and subesophageal masses are connected to each other on either side of the esophagus by the basal lobes and the dorsal magnocellular lobes.<ref name="butler"/> The large optic lobes are sometimes not considered to be part of the brain, as they are anatomically separate and are joined to the brain by the optic stalks. However, the optic lobes perform much visual processing, and so functionally are part of the brain.

===Mammals and other vertebrates===
The telencephalon (cerebrum) is the largest region of the mammalian brain. This is the structure that is most easily visible in brain specimens, and is what most people associate with the "brain". In humans and several other animals, the fissures (sulci) and convolutions (gyri) give the brain a wrinkled appearance. In non-mammalian vertebrates with no cerebrum, the metencephalon is the highest center in the brain. Because humans walk upright, there is a flexure, or bend, in the brain between the brain stem and the cerebrum. Other vertebrates do not have this flexure. Generally, comparing the locations of certain brain structures between humans and other vertebrates often reveals a number of differences.

Behind (or in humans, below) the cerebrum is the cerebellum. The cerebellum is known to be involved in the control of movement,<ref name="kandel"/> and is connected by thick white matter fibers (cerebellar peduncles) to the pons.<ref name="martin"></ref>  The cerebrum has two cerebral hemispheres. The cerebellum also has hemispheres. The telencephalic hemispheres are connected by the corpus callosum, another large white matter tract. An outgrowth of the telencephalon called the olfactory bulb is a major structure in many animals, but in humans and other primates it is relatively small.

Vertebrate nervous systems are distinguished by bilaterally symmetrical encephalization. Encephalization refers to the tendency for more complex organisms to gain larger brains through evolutionary time. Larger vertebrates develop a complex, layered and interconnected neuronal circuitry. In modern species most closely related to the first vertebrates, brains are covered with gray matter that has a three-layer structure (allocortex). Their brains also contain deep brain nuclei and fiber tracts forming the white matter. Most regions of the human cerebral cortex have six layers of neurons (neocortex).<ref name="martin" />

====Vertebrate brain regions====
(''See related article at List of regions in the human brain'')
thumb|right|238px|Diagram depicting the main subdivisions of the [[embryogenesis|embryonic vertebrate brain. These regions will later differentiate into forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain structures.]]
According to the hierarchy based on embryonic and evolutionary development, chordate brains are composed of the three regions that later develop into five total divisions:
*Rhombencephalon (hindbrain)
**Myelencephalon
**Metencephalon
*Mesencephalon (midbrain)
*Prosencephalon (forebrain)
**Diencephalon
**Telencephalon

The brain can also be classified according to function, including divisions such as:
*Limbic system
*Sensory systems
**Visual system
**Olfactory system
**Gustatory system
**Auditory system
**Somatosensory system
*Motor system
*Associative areas

In recent years it was realized that certain convergently from mammals such as humans. Hence, the functional areas of the avian brain have been redefined by the Avian Brain Nomenclature Consortium. See also Bird intelligence.

====Humans====

thumb|238px|Human brain with color coded lobes

The structure of the human brain differs from that of other animals in several important ways. These differences allow for many abilities over and above those of other animals, such as advanced cognitive skills. Human encephalization is especially pronounced in the neocortex, the most complex part of the cerebral cortex. The proportion of the human brain that is devoted to the neocortex—especially to the prefrontal cortex—is larger than in all other mammals (indeed larger than in all animals, although only in mammals has the neocortex evolved to fulfill this kind of function).

Humans have unique neural capacities, but much of their brain structure is similar to that of other mammals. Basic systems that alert the nervous system to stimulus, that sense events in the environment, and monitor the condition of the body are similar to those of even non-mammalian vertebrates. The neural circuitry underlying human consciousness includes both the advanced neocortex and prototypical structures of the brainstem. The human brain also has a massive number of synaptic connections allowing for a great deal of parallel processing.

The human brain is also the largest organ in the Nervous System.

==Neurobiology==

The brain is composed of two broad classes of cells, neurons and glia, both of which contain several different cell types which perform different functions. Interconnected neurons form neural networks (or neural ensembles). These networks are similar to man-made electrical circuits in that they contain circuit elements (neurons) connected by biological wires (nerve fibers). These do not form simple one-to-one electrical circuits like many man-made circuits, however. Typically neurons connect to at least a thousand other neurons.<ref> (Statistic from page 161)</ref> These highly specialized circuits make up systems which are the basis of perception, different types of action, and higher cognitive function.

===Structure===

Neurons are the cells that convey information to other cells; these constitute the essential class of brain cells.

In addition to neurons, the brain contains soma, dendrites, and unmyelinated portions of axons and glia. The space between neurons is filled with dendrites as well as unmyelinated segments of axons; this area is referred to as the neuropil.

In mammals, the brain is surrounded by connective tissues called the meninges, a system of membranes that separate the skull from the brain. This three-layered covering is composed of (from the outside in) the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. The arachnoid and pia are physically connected and thus often considered as a single layer, the pia-arachnoid. Below the arachnoid is the subarachnoid space which contains cerebrospinal fluid, a substance that protects the nervous system. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through the perivascular space above the pia mater. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly, forming the blood-brain barrier which protects the brain from toxins that might enter through the blood.

The brain is bathed in ventricles. It is important both chemically for lb. The stress caused by the brain’s mass.

===Function===
Vertebrate brains receive signals through nerves arriving from the sensors of the organism. These signals are then processed throughout the central nervous system; reactions are formulated based upon reflex and learned experiences. A similarly extensive nerve network delivers signals from a brain to control important muscles throughout the body. Anatomically, the majority of afferent and efferent nerves (with the exception of the cranial nerves) are connected to the spinal cord, which then transfers the signals to and from the brain.

Sensory input is processed by the brain to recognize danger, find food, identify potential mates, and perform more sophisticated functions. Visual, touch, and auditory sensory pathways of vertebrates are routed to specific nuclei of the thalamus and then to regions of the cerebral cortex that are specific to each sensory system, the visual system, the auditory system, and the somatosensory system. Olfactory pathways are routed to the olfactory bulb, then to various parts of the olfactory system. Taste is routed through the brainstem and then to other portions of the gustatory system.

To control movement the brain has several parallel systems of muscle control. The motor system controls voluntary muscle movement, aided by the motor cortex, cerebellum, and the basal ganglia. The system eventually projects to the spinal cord and then out to the muscle effectors. Nuclei in the brain stem control many involuntary muscle functions such as heart rate and breathing. In addition, many automatic acts (simple reflexes, locomotion) can be controlled by the spinal cord alone.

Brains also produce a portion of the body's hormones that can influence organs and glands elsewhere in a body—conversely, brains also react to hormones produced elsewhere in the body. In mammals, the hormones that regulate hormone production throughout the body are produced in the brain by the structure called the pituitary gland.

Evidence strongly suggests that developed brains derive consciousness from the complex interactions between the numerous systems within the brain. Cognitive processing in mammals occurs in the cerebral cortex but relies on midbrain and limbic functions as well. Among "younger" (in an evolutionary sense) vertebrates, advanced processing involves progressively rostral (forward) regions of the brain.

Hormones, incoming sensory information, and cognitive processing performed by the brain determine the brain state. Stimulus from any source can trigger a general arousal process that focuses cortical operations to processing of the new information. This focusing of cognition is known as attention. Cognitive priorities are constantly shifted by a variety of factors such as hunger, fatigue, belief, unfamiliar information, or threat. The simplest dichotomy related to the processing of threats is the fight-or-flight response mediated by the amygdala and other limbic structures.

====Neurotransmitter systems==== 

Neurons expressing certain types of neurotransmitters sometimes form distinct systems, where activation of the system causes effects in large volumes of the brain, called ''volume transmission''.

The major neurotransmitter systems are the noradrenaline (norepinephrine) system, the dopamine system, the serotonin system and the cholinergic system.

Drugs targeting the neurotransmitter of such systems affects the whole system, which explains the mode of action of many drugs;
* synaptic gap longer. 
* selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), hence potentiating the effect of naturally released serotonin. 
* AMPT prevents the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine; reserpine prevents dopamine storage within vesicles; and deprenyl inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B and thus increases dopamine levels.
