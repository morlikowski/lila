'''Górnik Zabrze''' (pron.  ) is a Polish football club from championships, and was a dominant force in the 1960s and 1980s. Although they have not won the title since 1988, the club remains a member of the Ekstraklasa, Poland's top division. The club plays in red and white kit, and is based at the Ernest Pohl Stadium.

==History==
===First years===
The club was founded in 1948, three years after borders of Poland had switched westwards and the city of Zabrze (until then called Hindenburg) became part of the Polish Republic. Gornik was based on several smaller sports associations that had existed in Zabrze between 1945 and 1948 - KS Zjednoczenie, KS Pogon, KS Skra, KS Concordia. The clubs merged into a single organisation, which took the name "Górnik", the Polish word for "Miner", reflecting the fact that Zabrze was an important coal-mining centre.

In 1950 Górnik joined the Opole Silesia regional league. In 1952 the club was promoted to the Polish Second Division. Their first game in the second tier was against Skra Częstochowa, and was witnessed by 20,000, with Gornik winning 5-1. The whole season was very successful and Gornik finished second overall, behind Gornik Wałbrzych.

The club was promoted to the top division in 1955. In their first game in the top flight Górnik beat local rivals Ruch Chorzów 3-1, with 25,000 in attendance; the club finished the season in 6th place.

===First successes===
In 1957, just a year after promotion, Górnik won its first championship of Poland. The team, with star, Tottenham Hotspur.

===Golden years===
The next championship, won in 1963, marked the beginning of an unusual streak of five consecutive titles (1963, 64, 65, 66 and 67), which is a Polish record.

Górnik's biggest success in European football took place in 1970 (even though in Poland the team was second, after Legia Warsaw). In the Olympiacos, Rangers, Levski Sofia and Manchester City turned out to be the better team, winning 2-1. The following season Górnik would once again play Manchester City, with the 1970 final being repeated this time in the First Round.

===Late 1970s and early 1980s===
Since mid-1970s Górnik deteriorated and in late spring of 1978, the team was relegated to the Second Division. However, it returned after one year and in games of 1979-80, Zabrze's side finished sixth. In 1984, after purchasing of a group of talented players (Ryszard Komornicki, Waldemar Matysik, Eugeniusz Cebrat, Andrzej Zgutczyński,  Tadeusz Dolny, Andrzej Pałasz), Gornik finished fourth, which was a sign of better times.

===Late 1980s until now===
Between 1985 and 1988 Górnik again marked a magnificent streak, with four consecutive championships. Zabrze's side also played versus renowned European powerhouses, such as Bayern Munich, Anderlecht, Juventus and Real Madrid. 

In 1994 Górnik tried to regain the crown, and with such players as Jerzy Brzęczek, Grzegorz Mielcarski, Tomasz Wałdoch, hopes were high. However, in the last game in Warsaw, Gornik tied 1-1 with Legia, due to partisan refereeing, which gave Legia the crown. The referee was Slawomir Redzinski who has finished his job after this match. Since this game to nowadays nooone knows who and how much paid Redzinski's. This crime has come under the statute of limitations.

Also, in the same year Górnik played its last so far game in European Cups, losing to Admira Wacker Vienna.

In the spring of 2007 Górnik got a new, rich sponsor - German insurance company  Allianz. Several new players were bought (together with Brzeczek and Tomasz Hajto). With strong financial support, Zabrze's supporters hope that good times will return.
