'''Peterborough United Football Club''' is an English professional football team based in League One for the 2008-09 season (having finished second in League Two in the 2007-08 season). The club was formed in 1934 and was first admitted to the Football League in 1960, replacing Northampton Town, a rivalry which has endured since the 1960s. However, the majority of fans consider Cambridge United to be the club's main foes &mdash; this game is known as the Cambridgeshire derby. 

MK Dons are now also considered a new rival for Peterborough, due to both teams promotion battle last season. This looks set to continue into the new season as both look to impress in League One.

Peterborough's greatest ever player is arguably Fourth Division championship. 

The club also had a proud tradition of producing successful young players, those to have recently come through the youth academy have included Simon Davies (now at Fulham), West Ham United) and Norwich City).

==History==
===Formation===
Peterborough United were formed in 1934 at a meeting held in Peterborough's Angel Hotel in order to provide the town with a replacement for Peterborough and Fletton United, who had folded two years previously.<ref name=clubhistory></ref>

The Posh were elected to 1960&ndash;61 season, joining and winning Division Four.<ref name=fchd></ref> They played in Football League Division One between 1992 and 1994 and they finished 10th, the best position of them, in 1992-93 season.

===Recent history===
During the 2005-06 season the club had three managers: team owner Mark Wright's sacking in January. Wright's assistant Keith Alexander joined as manager from Lincoln City for the 2006-07 season.

On September 18, 2006 Peterborough United announced the "biggest signing in the club's history", new chairman Darragh MacAnthony chairman of MRI Overseas Property. MacAnthony has purchased 200 shares in PUFC and has stated that his goal is to become the sole owner of the Club. As of yet, no more details have been announced. In its AGM of 05/09/2006 the Posh Supporters' Trust stated that it owned 1390 shares in PUFC. The deal was delayed as of November 2006 when the owners of the Ground Peterborough United Holdings Ltd (PUHL) refused to accept the sale until they receive planning permission their proposed development of the Moyes End Terrace and building of 135 Luxury flats. Despite this MacAnthony has said he will not walk away from the club.

With the prospect of rich new ownership a £1m bid for striker MK Dons. They have since signed George Boyd from Stevenage for a reported fee of around £260,000 [http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=438532&CPID=12&clid=73&lid=&title=Posh+bag+duo] , Grays Athletic for a figure expected to be around £150,000  [http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=438600&CPID=12&clid=73&lid=&title=Morgan+completes+Posh+move] and Leicester for a fee rising to £100,000 [http://home.skysports.com/transferarticle.aspx?hlid=439398].

They have also signed 32 year old central midfielder Micah Hyde for £75,000 (raising to £100,000 if Peterborough get promotion) from Burnley and goalkeeper Shwan Jalal from Woking for an undisclosed fee to continue their bid spending.

While Alexander had some success in the role, leading the club to its best-ever start to a season and keeping them in the play-off positions for most of the 2006-07 season, he was nonetheless sacked in January due to a run of six defeats in a row, and his long-ball tactics met with disapproval among fans even when the club was near the top of the table. After a brief caretaker spell by Tommy Taylor, Darren Ferguson was installed as player-manager.

Ferguson had a good start to his managerial career, and was unlucky to only gain 1 point from his first 3 games after some good performances. Ironically, the first win in his managerial career was against his former club, Wrexham.

Ferguson appointed Kevin Russell as his assistant, and Ben MacKenzie as fitness coach.

Peterborough United Chairman Darragh MacAnthony has proposed a 15,000 all seater stadium to replace the current London Road stadium which has a capacity of 15,314.

On the 19 April 2008, Peterborough were promoted to the Coca-Cola Football League 1 after Dean Keates header secured a 1-0 victory against Hereford United.
