'''Arleigh Albert Burke''' (Eisenhower administration.

==Early life and naval career==
left|thumb|Arleigh Burke. Taken in 1920 while he was attending the U.S. Naval Academy.

Burke was born far from the sea, in Boulder, Colorado. On 8 June 1923, he graduated from the United States Naval Academy, was commissioned ensign in the United States Navy, and married Miss Roberta Gorsuch of Washington, D.C..

Over the next 18 years, Burke prepared himself for combat, serving in battleships and destroyers, and earning a Master of Science in Engineering at the University of Michigan. When World War II came, he found himself, to his great disappointment, in a shore billet at the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.. After persistent effort on his part, he received orders to join the fighting in the South Pacific.

==World War II==
Burke would spend the remainder of the war in the South Pacific. He successively commanded Destroyer Division 43, Destroyer Division 44, Destroyer Squadron 12, and Bougainville in November cruiser, nine destroyers, one submarine, several smaller ships, and approximately 30 aircraft.

He usually pushed his destroyers to just under boiler-bursting speed, but while ''en route'' to a rendezvous prior to the Battle of Cape St. George, a boiler casualty limited his squadron to 31 knots, rather than the 34 they were otherwise capable of. Thereafter, his nickname was "31-knot Burke," originally a taunt, later a popular symbol of his hard-charging nature.

In March 1944, Burke was promoted to Chief of Staff to the Commander Commodore, and participated in all the force's naval engagements until June 1945, shortly before the surrender of Japan. He was aboard both  and  when they were hit by Japanese suicide planes during the Okinawa campaign.

After the end of the war, Burke reverted to his permanent rank of Captain and continued his naval career by serving in a number of capacities, including again as Admiral Mitscher's chief of staff, until the latter's death in 1947. Burke then took command of  for a cruise down the east coast of Africa. Captain Burke was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1949 and served as Navy Secretary on the Defense Research and Development Board.

==Korean War==
At the outbreak of the CNO, ordered Burke to duty as Deputy Chief of Staff to Commander Naval Forces, Far East. From there, he assumed command of Cruiser Division Five, and, in July 1951, was made a member of the United Nations Truce Delegation which negotiated with the Communists for military armistice in Korea. After six months in the truce tents, he returned to the Office of Chief of Naval Operations where he served as Director of Strategic Plans Division until 1954.

In April 1954, he took command of Cruiser Division Six, then moved in January 1955 to command Destroyer Force Atlantic Fleet. In   August 1955, Burke succeeded Admiral Robert B. Carney as Chief of Naval Operations. At the time of his appointment as Chief of Naval Operations, Burke was still a Rear Admiral and was promoted over the heads of many Flag Officers who were senior to him. Admiral Burke had never served as a Vice Admiral, so he was promoted two grades at the time of his appointment as CNO.

==Chief of Naval Operations==
Burke served an unprecedented three terms as CNO. He served at a critical time in world history, the depths of the Cold War.
The fact that he was relatively young compared to other Flag Officers at the time, and an excellent manager and organizer was
key to his success.  He supported the touchy Adm. Hyman Rickover in the development of a nuclear navy.  More directly, he promoted
the Polaris missile program at a time when others in the Navy were very skeptical of the idea of a missile launched from a 
submarine. He was involved in "The Revolt of the Admirals", a near mutiny by the leaders of the Navy, and was saved from  being fired by the intervention of President Truman.  His terms as CNO were times of growth and progress in the Navy. Upon completing his third term, he was transferred 
to the Retired List on 1 August 1961.

Admiral Burke received numerous combat awards during his forty-two years in the Navy including the USS ''Procyon'', he was commended for the "rescue of shipwrecked and seafaring men," and in USS ''Mugford'', he was commended when his destroyer won the fleet gunnery trophy with the highest score in many years. His ship also stood third in engineering competition and high in communication competition.

Admiral Burke, himself of Swedish descent, was the senior representative of the United States of America on the funeral of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden in 1973.
