'''亞利桑那州立大學''' ('''Arizona State University''')，簡稱'''ASU'''，是位於男女兼收公立鳳凰城大都會區各地的4個校區所組成，擁有22個學院<ref name=colleges></ref>。ASU在1885年成立，是師範學校，其後因為穩定的成長與擴展，在美國大學學生數目最多列表<ref name=size></ref>中，以51,481人排名第三。

除了坦佩校園外，ASU還有其他三個校園。分別是：
* 西校園：1984年成立在鳳凰城西北方。
* 理工校園：Mesa。
* 鳳凰城市區校園：2006年8月成立在鳳凰城市中心。
2006年到2007年間，共有13,629名研究生從ASU畢業。在2007年，一共有148名獲得全國優秀學生獎學金的學生選擇加入ASU。<ref name=QF/>，其中大部份都是Barrett榮譽學院的一員。Barrett榮譽學院在1988年成立，有許多獎助學金的得主都會加入此學院。在1994年時，ASU被歸類為"RU/VH"大學 (very high research activity大學，非常多研究活動的大學)。

==校園==
ASU有四個主要的校園，包括歷史最久且面積最大的坦佩校園、位於西校園、位於Eastern Mesa的理工校園及位於市區校園。<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/campuses/ ASU Campuses<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>每一個校園都提供學士學位、碩士學位及博士學位。

不像大學系統，ASU的校園都隸屬於同一所大學，且只有一位共同的校長管理大學內的教職人員及學生。<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/provost/about/oneuniversity.html One University in Many Places] Explanation of the ASU campus organization</ref>而且，不管你從那個校園畢業的，所頒發的學位證書都一樣。因為在坦佩的最原始的校園已經接近飽和，所以ASU將整頓它的學院及校系，將一些遷往新校園。

===坦佩校園===
*藝術學院 (Katherine K. Herberger College of the Arts)
*商業學院 (W.P. Carey School of Business)

==History==

thumb|250px|right|[[Old Main (Arizona State University)|Old Main]]
Originally named the 13th Legislative Assembly of the Arizona Territory.  Instruction was instituted on February 8, 1886 under the supervision of Principal Hiram Bradford Farmer.  Land for the school was donated by Tempe residents George and Martha Wilson, allowing 33 students to meet in a single room.<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/about/history/more.html More ASU History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Early years===
At the beginning of the 20th century the schools name was changed from Tempe Normal School to the Normal School of Arizona, and President Arthur John Matthews brought a 30-year tenure of progress to the school.

Under his tenure the school was given all-college student status; before becoming a college the Normal School enrolled high school students with no other secondary education facilities. The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision.  Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still in use. He envisioned an "evergreen campus," with many shrubbery brought to the campus and the planting of Palm Walk, now one of the feature landmarks of the school.  His legacy is being continued today: the main campus is a nationally recognized arboretum.<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/fm/arboretum.htm The Arboretum at Arizona State University<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

During the Great Depression, Ralph W. Swetman was hired as president for a three-year term.<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/preslist.htm Archives & Special Collections, Principals and Presidents of Arizona State University]</ref>  Although enrollment increased by almost 100% during his tenure due to the depression, many faculty were terminated and faculty salaries were cut. <ref>"[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/11lead.htm Eighth President Ralph Waldo Swetman 1930-1933]"</ref>

===Gammage years===
thumb|250px|right|[[Gammage Auditorium,which was placed on the Flagstaff, became president of Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe, a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years.

Like his predecessor, Dr. Gammage oversaw the construction of a number of buildings on the Tempe campus.  Dr. Gammage oversaw the development of the university, graduate programs, and the renaming of the Arizona State College to Arizona State University.

===Years of growth and stature===
During the 1960s, with the presidency of Dr. G. Homer Durham, Arizona State University began to expand its academic curriculum by establishing several new colleges and beginning to award Doctor of Philosophy and other doctoral degrees.<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/16lead.htm ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The next three presidents—Harry K. Newburn, 1969–71, John W. Schwada, 1971–81, and J. Russell Nelson, 1981–89—and Interim President Richard Peck, 1989, led the university to increased academic stature, creation of the West Campus, and rising enrollment.

Under the leadership of Dr. Lattie F. Coor, from 1990 to June 2002, ASU grew to serve the Valley of the Sun through the creation of the Polytechnic campus and extended education sites. His commitment to diversity, quality in Barrett Honors College, the Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts, and the Morrison School of Agribusiness and Resource Management at the Polytechnic campus; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/21lead.htm ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===The Crow Era===
thumb|250px|right|The Biodesign Institute is the result of a major capital campaign designed to increase ASU's involvement in biotechnology.
On July 1, 2002, Michael Crow would become the university's 16th president. At his inauguration, President Crow outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a New American University—one that would be open and inclusive. As the only research university serving the metropolitan Phoenix area, Crow has stated that ASU is in a unique position to evolve together with the city into one of the great intellectual institutions in the world.

Under Crow's leadership, and aided by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, ASU has embarked on its most aggressive capital building effort in more than a decade. The university is adding one million square feet of world-class research infrastructure, and is continuing its development and expansion of the West, Polytechnic and Downtown campuses. <ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special48/articles/1214crow1216-ON.html Viewpoints: ASU's Michael Crow first 5 years<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

|}
Arizona State University comprises four campuses: the West Campus in northwest Phoenix, the Polytechnic Campus located in Eastern Mesa, and the Downtown Campus in downtown Phoenix.<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/campuses/ ASU Campuses<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Although there is some redundancy in undergraduate academic offerings across the campuses, each campus was designed to host a unique set of colleges and departments.<ref name = "xvjbbz">[http://www.asu.edu/provost/about/oneuniversity.html One University in Many Places] Explanation of the ASU campus organization</ref> All four campuses award Bachelor's degrees, Master's degrees, and Doctorates.

Unlike a university system, the ASU campuses are all part of a single university, with a common administration presiding over the faculty, staff, and students.<ref name = "xvjbbz"/> Indeed, students receive the same diplomas regardless of which campus they primarily attended. As the original ASU campus in Tempe has nearly reached build-out, the university is reorganizing its colleges and schools, moving some to the newer campuses.

===Tempe Campus===
thumb|250px|right|Located on the Tempe campus, the partially-underground Hayden Library serves as the main library at ASU.
ASU's Tempe campus lies in the heart of Phoenix. The campus is considered urban, and is approximately  in size. ASU Tempe Campus is arranged around broad pedestrian malls and is completely encompassed by an arboretum.<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/asuwebrw/entrance/tempe/ ASU's Tempe campus<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.azarboretum.org/ Arizona Arboretums And Botanical Gardens<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Sitting next to Tempe Town Lake, it crosses University Drive and is defined by its borders on Apache Blvd, Rural Road, and Mill Avenue. Against the northwest edge of campus is the Mill Avenue district, which has a college atmosphere that attracts many students to its restaurants and bars.  The Tempe campus has expanded to Mill Avenue with The Brickyard, which is a part of the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering.  ASU's Tempe Campus is also home to all the schools athletic facilities.

The Tempe Campus is the original campus, and Old Main, the first building constructed on the campus, still stands today.  Not only is it the oldest but also the largest campus, with more than 50,000 students total.<ref>http://uoia.asu.edu/files/quickfacts/Quick_Facts_Fall_2007.pdf</ref>  There are many notable landmarks on campus, including Old Main, the University Club Building, and University Bridge.

The Tempe campus comprises the following schools and colleges:<ref name = "lqapsm">[http://www.asu.edu/colleges/ List of ASU Colleges]</ref>
*College of Liberal Arts and Sciences
*Herberger College of the Arts
*W.P. Carey School of Business
*College of Design
*Mary Lou Fulton College of Education
*Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering
*Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law
*School of Sustainability

===West Campus===
thumb|250px|right|Fletcher Library Lawn on the ASU West Campus

The West campus sits on  in northwest Phoenix, bordering the city of Glendale, Arizona; however, much of the campus is undeveloped land, with only 28.5 acres of it fully-developed.<ref>As measured on Google Earth, not including satellite parking lots</ref> The West campus lies about  northwest of downtown Phoenix, and about  northwest of the Tempe campus. The West campus focuses on liberal arts and interdisciplinary programs, <ref name = "xvjbbz"/> enrolls nearly 9,000 students and offers 54 degree programs in five colleges. The campus originally focused on undergraduate education, but now offers numerous programs leading to masters degrees and doctoral degrees. As the campus continues to grow, additional graduate programs will be offered.<ref>[http://asunews.asu.edu/20080201_westgrowth West Campus Gears Up for Growth]</ref>

The West campus comprises the following schools and colleges:<ref name = "lqapsm"/>
*New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences
*School of Global Management and Leadership
*College of Human Services
*College of Teacher Education and Leadership
*School of Criminology and Criminal Justice

Founded originally as ASU East, the campus opened in fall 1996 on the former Williams Air Force Base in eastern Mesa, Arizona.  The campus opened with nearly 1,000 students enrolled in one of the eight degrees offered. The small campus started with two schools -- School of Technology and School of Management and Agribusiness. East College was added in 1997 as an incubator for new professional programs.

Today nearly 8,800 students are enrolled in 40 degree programs. ASU shares more than  in eastern Mesa with Chandler-Gilbert Community College, Mesa Community College, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, a United States Air Force research laboratory, a Veteran's Administration Clinic and the Silvestre Herrera Army Reserve Center. These entities make up what is known as the Williams Campus.

==Academics==

ASU offers over 250 majors to undergraduate students, and more than 100 graduate programs leading to masters and doctoral degrees. These programs are divided into over a dozen colleges and schools, the largest of which is the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, which houses nearly 30 programs and departments. Degrees awarded include the B.A.,  B.S., B.S.E., B.I.S., M.A., M.S., M.F.A., M.B.A., L.L.M., M.M., M.Eng., Ph.D., J.D., Ed.D., and D.M.A..

===Reputation and ranking===
====Undergraduate program====
ASU is ranked 124th in the top tier of national research universities by the US News and World Report guide to US colleges. Barrett, The Honors College serves as a virtual university-within-a-university and maintains strict admissions standards while providing a more rigorous curriculum with smaller classes and increased faculty interaction.<ref>[http://honors.asu.edu/w-About_Barrett-170.aspx Barrett, The Honors College - Arizona State University<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This honors college is largely responsible for the 188 freshmen National Merit Scholars who chose ASU in 2007.  In 2007 ASU also announced that it added 17 Fulbright students, and 15 NSEP students.

As of the Spring of 2007, resident tuition and fees totaled $2,345 for 7+ credit hours.  The total for non-resident tuition and fees is $7,924 for 12+ credit hours.  Current and prospective students should expect these rates to continually rise over the next few years.

ASU has had a reputation as a "The Simpsons'' and ''American Dad!''). In recent years, even though ASU's academic rigor has increased, ASU still regularly appears in several of the "top party school" rankings.
