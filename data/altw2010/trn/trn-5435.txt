L''''Evolution''' era una heel di wrestler attiva nella roster di ''Raw''. Era formata da Triple H (leader della formazione), Batista e Four Horsemen della National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) e World Championship Wrestling (WCW).

==Storia==
Il primo passo verso la nascita di questa stable fu l'alleanza fra Flair e Triple H, stipulata verso la fine pay-per-view ''Armageddon'', quando Triple H conquistò il World Heavyweight Championship, Batista e Flair il World Tag Team Championship e Orton l'Intercontinental Championship.

Durante la puntata di ''Raw'' del Summerslam'' contro Elimination Chamber Match di ''New Year's Revolution''; Batista venne però eliminato prima che si potesse trovare solo sul ring con Triple H. 

Batista vinse poi la ''Royal Rumble'', cosa che permise al membro dell'Evolution di affrontare uno dei due massimi campioni della WWE, ovvero l'allora WWE Champion John Bradshaw Layfield (JBL) e Triple H. Triple H e Flair provarono a convincere Batista a passare al roster di ''SmackDown!'' per affrontare JBL ed in un primo momento le cose sembrarono andare nel verso desiderato dal leader del gruppo. Tuttavia al momento della firma del contratto per il match titolato, il WrestleMania 21'' sconfiggendo appunto Triple H; rimase campione per più di 8 mesi, quando fu costretto a privarsi del titolo per un infortunio.

'''Evolution''' was a heel stable on RAW brand consisting of Batista. The group is considered by many to be modeled after Ric Flair's old stable, the Four Horsemen, from the National Wrestling Alliance and World Championship Wrestling.<ref name="evolution"/>

==History==
===Formation (2002–2003)===
At Unforgiven in 2002, World Heavyweight Championship against Batista moved from SmackDown! to Raw and took Flair as his manager. When Triple H began his feud with Scott Steiner at the beginning of 2003, Batista and Randy Orton both assisted him along with Flair.<ref></ref>

The group was officially founded on February 3, 2003 and called itself '''Evolution''', as in "the Evolution of this business." Each of the members represented the best in "the past" (Ric Flair), "the present" (Triple H), and "the future" (Randy Orton and Batista) of professional wrestling.<ref name="evolution"/><ref></ref> The stable got off to a rocky start as both Batista and Orton were injured in matches in February 2003. On May 26 edition of ''Raw'', Orton returned as a masked man who attacked both Shawn Michaels and Kevin Nash after a 2-on-1 handicap match with Flair and Michaels taking on Triple H. He then unmasked himself and rejoined the group.<ref name="evolution"/><ref></ref>

===Feuds with Shawn Michaels and Goldberg (2003)===
In 2003, at Bad Blood, Flair was able to defeat Shawn Michaels after Orton whacked Michaels with a chair. Later that night, Triple H retained his World Heavyweight Championship in a Unforgiven, Orton (who had a "Legend Killer" gimmick) defeated Michaels to prove that he was indeed a Legend Killer.<ref></ref> Later that night, Triple H defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Goldberg. Despite help from Flair, Triple H lost the title to Goldberg.<ref name="Unforgiven - Goldberg vs HHH"></ref>

On September 29 edition of ''Raw'', Triple H issued a $100,000 Survivor Series, Orton participated in a Team Bischoff vs. Team Austin elimination tag team match in which Orton was the sole survivor.<ref></ref> Later that night, Goldberg faced Triple H in a rematch from Unforgiven for the World Heavyweight Championship which Goldberg won despite repeated interference from Flair, Orton and Batista.<ref name="Survivor Series - Goldberg vs HHH"></ref>

Flair's character trademarks of coming out in suits and being a noted Playboy, along with his and Triple H's trademark heel ruthlessness, were traits that carried over into the entire stable, both during and for a couple of years after Evolution. While in the group each of the members had individual quirks:
*'''Orton''', after returning from injury in May 2003, became "the Legend Killer" and humiliated and sometimes defeated numerous "legendary" wrestlers and celebrities, becoming infamous when he spat in the face of Mick Foley and later on Harley Race.
*'''Batista''', known as "Evolution's Animal" (shortened to "The Animal"), was the silent, strong enforcer of the group. His progress as a wrestler and personality wasn't as quick as Orton's and he was mainly kept in the background until after Orton was kicked out.
*'''Flair''', "The Nature Boy" and the "Dirtiest Player in the Game", took a managerial role and mainly focused on helping the others, though he became increasingly more active as a wrestler as the group progressed, including winning the World Tag Team titles with Batista. 
*'''Triple H''', "The Game", was the leader and the one who either possessed or pursued the World Heavyweight title at all times. He was champion when the group formed and he lost the belt to Chris Benoit, who would later be defeated by Orton. Orton's victory led to his eventual expulsion from the group.

===Success (2003–2004)===
