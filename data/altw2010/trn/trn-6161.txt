'''Thai resort island of Phuket. On September 16, 2007, amid heavy rains and strong crosswinds at Phuket International Airport and after the pilots failed to properly execute a go-around, the aircraft came down hard on runway 27 and struck a wooded embankment. The aircraft broke into two, caught fire almost immediately, and was completely destroyed, causing 90 deaths.<ref name="airsafe">{{cite web

According to Vutichai Singhamany, a safety director at Thailand's Department of Civil Aviation, the pilot had deployed the landing gear on his approach to Phuket airport runway 27, but had retracted it while trying to pull up for a go-around. Mr Singhamany added that the wheels had not touched the runway and that the accident had happened right after the pilot raised the nose of the aircraft to abort the landing.<ref name="channelnewsasia_07">{{Cite news

An aircraft that had landed four minutes before the arrival of the doomed plane had informed the Captain Arief Mulyadi, the 56-year-old Indonesian pilot of flight 269 and Montri, the Thai First Officer. First Officer Montri was the flying pilot. Numerous errors ensued, including the failure to properly set the aircraft for a windsheer go around and culminating in a situation in which neither Arief nor Montri were flying the aircraft for 15 of the final 19 seconds of flight.  (Windsheer was not a significant factor in the crash) <ref name="london times">{{Cite news

23-year-old Parinyawich Chusaeng, who survived the crash on flight 269, told AFP:<ref name="channelnewsasia_01" />

<blockquote>
"The plane just dropped really fast and then jerked back up. The right wing hit a tree and then the plane hit the ground. The people all around me were burning. Some on the floor and some standing, and they were on fire."

<blockquote>"The visibility was poor as the pilot attempted to land. He decided to make a go-around but the plane lost balance and crashed. It was torn into two parts."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We started to go for the landing and [the pilot] just about hit the runway, but couldn't make it, so he lifted back up. We started to circle. I thought he was going to circle back around and try again, and then we took a sharp right and we started going for the ground." <br>
"We bounced once and then went straight into an embankment with trees and bushes."<br>
"It was raining really hard. We saw a couple of people who were on fire. Just a handful of us made it out. I counted 17 or 20 who had made it out on their own.".</blockquote>
