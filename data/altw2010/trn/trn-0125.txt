 (commonly abbreviated '''''MG''''') is a developed and first published by 1987 for the MSX2 home computer. The game is considered to be the progenitor of the stealth game genre, in which avoiding direct encounter with the enemy is emphasized over attacking openly.

The premise revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Metal Gear, a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world. 

The MSX2 version was initially released only in port for the Japanese Family Computer and its western counterpart, the mobile phones in 2004, followed by its inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence'' for the 2006, which led to a more mainstream English localization of the original MSX2 game in North America and Europe.

==Gameplay==
The player must navigate the main character (codenamed "Solid Snake") through various locations, while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen, the game enters the "Alert Mode." In this situation, the player must hide the character in order to leave the mode. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery: 

*If a player is seen and only a single exclamation mark (<font color=red>'''!'''</font>) appears over an enemy's head, only the enemies in the player's present screen will attack and an escape can be made by moving to the adjacent screen. 

*However, if two exclamation marks (<font color=red>'''!!'''</font>) appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by using an unsilenced weapon), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. The player can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies or by simply moving to a different floor.

At first, the player starts the game unarmed, but eventually gains access to a variety of firearms (starting with the Beretta M92F) and explosives and working his way up to machine guns and guided rocket launchers. Ammo and supplies for each weapon are limited, but are easily replenished. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles (such as hollow walls or electrified floors). Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up.

The enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors or explore new areas. Doors will only open to their corresponding key cards. Bosses also appear throughout the game to interfere with the player's progress.

Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held captive within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player is given a promotion, increasing their "Rank" (up to 4 stars max), allowing for bigger ammo capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank.

A transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer (Big Boss) or one of the resistance members operating covertly within the fortress. Each of Snake's allies has an extensive knowledge on specific subjects. The transceiver system is completely room-oriented, as certain radio transmissions occur only in certain locations.

==Plot==
===Characters===
The player's character is Solid Snake, a rookie member of the fictional special forces group FOXHOUND sent on his first mission. He is assisted via radio by his commanding officer Big Boss, who offers information about mission objectives and items; as well as a local Resistance movement comprised of Schneider, who provides the locations of important items; Diane, who provides information on how to defeat the game's bosses; and Jennifer, who assists Snake as an inside agent. Among the prisoners Snake rescues includes Gray Fox (Grey Fox in the MSX2 version), a FOXHOUND agent who was captured during a previous mission; Dr. Pettrovich, the scientist who designed the Metal Gear weapon; and his daughter Ellen, who was kidnapped along with him.

The bosses of the game includes Shotmaker (Shoot Gunner in the MSX2 version), a former SAS operative armed with a machine gun; Fire Trooper, a former GSG 9 operative who uses a flamethrower; Dirty Duck (Coward Duck in the MSX2 version), a boomerang throwing terrorist who shields himself with hostages; Bloody Brad (Arnold in the MSX2 version), an android designed by Dr. Pettrovich; and the legendary mercenary who founded Outer Heaven, whose identity is unknown until the end of the game.

===Story===

In the year Gray Fox infiltrated the Outer Heaven stronghold. Days later, contact with Gray Fox is lost and his last transmission simply reads "METAL GEAR..."

Operative Big Boss to rescue Gray Fox and carry out his mission, "Operation: Intrude N313".
Upon insertion into Outer Heaven, Snake makes contact with local resistance members Kyle Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer.  Using all of his skills and the equipment he procured on site, he manages to rescue Fox.  He learns from Fox that Metal Gear is the codename of a nuclear warhead-equipped bipedal walking tank, which can engage and dominate in all forms of combat as well as launch its nuclear warheads from any location. Outer Heaven plans to use Metal Gear to impose itself as the new world superpower.

In order to destroy Metal Gear, and topple the Outer Heaven mercenaries, Snake rescues the lead engineer of Metal Gear, Dr. Drago Pettrovich Madnar, and his daughter, Ellen. Armed with information on how to destroy Metal Gear, his skill and indomitable spirit, Snake fights through the entire Outer Heaven force. He begins to notice that traps being set for him are too precise, and wonders how information on his activities is being tracked. Moreover, Schneider is ambushed by hostiles and is presumed dead after losing contact with Snake. The final hostage Snake rescues tells him that the mysterious "mercenary leader" of the entire base is none other than Snake's C.O., Big Boss, and that Outer Heaven is under his command.
