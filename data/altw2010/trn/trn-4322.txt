'''''Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1''''' is the debut album by the supergroup Traveling Wilburys and was recorded and released in 1988 to enormous commercial success and critical acclaim. 

== Background ==

In early April 1988, George Harrison was in Los Angeles, California and needed to record a B-side for a European 12-inch single.  Jeff Lynne was also in Los Angeles producing some tracks for Roy Orbison as well as Tom Petty’s solo album.  While having dinner with Lynne and Orbison, Harrison related how he needed to record a new track and wanted to do it the next day.  Both offered to help.  Needing a studio on short notice, Harrison suggested they call Bob Dylan, who had a home studio.  After dinner, George stopped by Tom Petty’s house to pick up his guitar for the next day’s session and invited him along too.  Gathering at Dylan’s Malibu home the following day, they wrote and recorded the song “Handle with Care”, with all five sharing the vocals.<ref>Bauder, David. "Traveling Wilburys album a happy accident of music" ''The Associated Press'' December 11, 1988</ref>

The track was considered too good to be used as a B-side, so Harrison hatched the idea to form a band and record another nine songs for an album.  The group got together again for nine days in May, recording the basic tracks and vocals at Dave Stewart’s home studio in Los Angeles.  Overdubs and mixing were done back in England at Harrison’s home studio F.P.S.H.O.T. (Friar Park Studio, Henley-on-Thames).

Masquerading as the Wilbury brothers, the participants would be known as Nelson (Harrison), Otis (Lynne), Lucky (Dylan), Lefty (Orbison) and Charlie T. Jr. (Petty). Harrison was no stranger to the use of alternate identities with ''Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'', but this concept was taken a step further: their real names never appear anywhere on the album, liner notes, or even the songwriting credits.

With Harrison having the greatest claim to the band, he signed them up to Warner Bros. Records (which Petty eventually signed to himself), his current label, and incorporated their own Wilbury Records label, in addition to producing the sessions with Lynne that spring.

== The album ==

Released October 18, 1988, ''Volume One'' became the surprise hit of the year, selling two million copies within six months.  Although the single "Handle With Care" did not scale the pop charts (it stalled at US #45), the album did, reaching #16 in the UK and an impressive #3 in the US. With over fifty weeks on the charts, the album was later certified triple-platinum. While Harrison and Petty had had recent successes, Dylan, Orbison and Lynne had not seen an album climb that high in several years. At the time, no Dylan album had ever achieved two million in sales. As one critic put it, it was "one of the great commercial coups of the decade."

Most critics said the group's modest ambitions were fresh and relaxing. During 1989 and 1990 the album won many accolades, including a Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.

Orbison died suddenly of a heart attack on 6 December 1988.

After George Harrison’s distribution deal with Warner Bros. expired in 1995, ownership of the Vol. 3'' were re-issued by Rhino Records as ''The Traveling Wilburys Collection'', packaged together with bonus tracks and a DVD.  The box set debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart and at #9 on The Billboard 200.
