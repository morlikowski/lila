'''Alexander Valerievich Semin''' ((), born March 3, 1984 in Krasnoyarsk, USSR) is a Russian professional ice hockey player with Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League.

==Playing career==
In 2001-02, he played for one year with the Traktor Chelyabinsk hockey school.  He split the season between their juniors team and their regular team, and during the season he scored 21 goals and had 8 assists between the two clubs.

The Capitals selected Semin with their second pick, 13th overall (they selected Steve Eminger with their first pick, 12th overall) in the 2002 Entry draft; he decided to remain in Russia during the subsequent season.  In 2002-03, he scored 10 goals and made 7 assists in 47 games with Lada Togliatti.

In the 2003-04 NHL season, Semin made his NHL debut.  He scored 10 goals and assisted on 12 others during his stay in the NHL in 2003-04.  However, he missed his team's flight to Pittsburgh when the Capitals closed out their season against the Pittsburgh Penguins.  Semin then reported to Maine to play for the American Hockey League Portland Pirates, where he collected 15 points in four regular season and seven playoff games. 

During the 2004-05 NHL lockout, Semin played 50 games for Lada Togliatti, scoring 19 goals, assisting on 11 goals, and compiling a Plus/minus rating of +15.

Semin began the 2005-06 season with Lada, but financial difficulties with the team resulted in a deal that brought him to Khimik (Chemist), a Russian Superleague team in Mytischi, just outside of Moscow. [http://www.tltnews.ru/art/fullnews.php?id=2228]  While with Lada, Semin played 16 games, accumulating 5 goals, 4 assists, and 52 penalty minutes.

Semin scored the first goal with the Capitals 2006-07 season against the New York Rangers on October 5, 2006. In his next game against Carolina he recorded a hat trick for the Capitals.

On March 18, 2007 Semin tallied the second natural hat trick of his career against the Tampa Bay Lightning, scoring three goals on three successive shots in a span of 7:04 in the second period.

Semin resides in the Bellevue Forest neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia with his parents, lifelong friend Russell Friesen, his dog Sergei and Friesen's dog Max.

===Military duty controversy===
There was some confusion about Semin's obligations to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, which requires all Russian men to serve two years.  However, the Armed Forces allow would-be soldiers who are hockey players to play for professional hockey teams in Russia during their period of service; they are not allowed to play for teams based in other countries.  Nikolai Zherdev of the Columbus Blue Jackets and some other young Russian players returned to their NHL clubs following the lockout, circumventing any additional military duty they had to serve in Russia.<ref name="Army"></ref>

In particular, it was arranged for Semin to play his second year with Lada during the NHL lockout; the Capitals suspended him for that whole season for not reporting to their American Hockey League affiliate, then the Hershey Bears, since many of their other young players were reporting there.  (Alexander Ovechkin, meanwhile, had decided to play for HC Dynamo Moscow.  The Capitals did not have Ovechkin report to Portland during the lockout because they thought he was already prepared to play regularly in the NHL.)

The Capitals started training camp for the 2005-06 season with neither Semin nor Czech forward Petr Sykora.  Sykora did arrive near the end of training camp; Semin was still in Russia at the start of the season, taking care of "paperwork" for the Russian Army.  The 2005-06 season was the second of three years in Semin's contract with the Capitals.

From a financial standpoint, Semin earned the equivalent of $2 million tax-free with a free car and condominium by playing for Lada in 2005-06, contrasted with the $950,000 for which he was under contract with the Capitals.  This became a major problem for Lada early in the 2005-06 season, when Lada suddenly ran into financial difficulties and had to let go of several members of their front office almost immediately to cut down on costs.  They have also already stated that they would cut their payroll by at least 50 percent; Semin is the highest-paid player on the team.

The news about Lada initially offered the Capitals some hope that Semin would join the team during the 2005-06 season, but a Capitals official stated that the team is not sure that they would want Semin to rejoin their team no matter what the circumstances, because of his playing for Lada rather than the Capitals.<ref name="Return"></ref>
