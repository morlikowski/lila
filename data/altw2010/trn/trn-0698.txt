'''Columbus''' is a Muscogee County, Georgia, Metropolitan Statistical Area, an MSA which encompasses all of Columbus, Georgia, Chattahoochee, Harris, Marion, and Muscogee counties, Georgia, and Auburn-Opelika, Combined Statistical Area. As of the 2000 Muscogee County, with which it is a consolidated city-county.  

Because of the consolidation and the 2001 annexation of Bibb City, Columbus is now listed with the same population and other demographic data as the entire county.  Fort Benning takes up most of the rest of the county.

== History ==
Founded in 1828 by an act of the Georgia Legislature, Columbus was situated at the end of the navigable portion of the Federal Road before entering Creek Indians lived until their removal in 1836.

The river served as Columbus' connection to the world, particularly connecting the commercial importance increased in the 1850s with the arrival of the Lowell of the South," in deference to the industrial town in Massachusetts. 

When the outbreak of war came in 1861, the industries of Columbus expanded their production and Columbus became one of the most important centers of industry in the Confederacy. In addition to textiles, the city had an Union detachment under General John Stith Pemberton, was wounded in this battle.  The owner of America's last slave ship, Col. Charles Augustus Lafayette Lamar, was killed here. Ironically, the battle occurred after Confederate General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, effectively ending the Civil War. A historic marker has been erected in Columbus marking the battle by Wilson's troops as the "Last Land Battle in the War Between the States."

Reconstruction began almost immediately and prosperity followed. The industrialization of the town led to rapid growth; the city had outgrown its original plan. Columbus was graced with the Springer Opera House on 10th Street, which has hosted over a century of great performers and still delights audiences today. 

By the time of the trolleys extending to outlying neighborhoods such as Rose Hill and Lakebottom and a new water works. Mayor Lucius Chappell also brought a training camp for soldiers to the area. This training camp named Camp Benning would grow into present day Fort Benning, named for General Henry L. Benning, a native of the city.

With the expansion of the city, the need for a university saw the establishment of Columbus College, a two-year institution which would later grow into Columbus State University, now a comprehensive center of higher learning. The city would consolidate city and county governments in 1971 and become the first of its kind in Georgia (and one of only 16 in the U.S. at the time). As the city has turned from its initial industry of textiles, it has provided a home for other prominent industries including the headquarters for Aflac, Synovus, TSYS and Carmike Cinemas.

During the 1960's, 1970s and 1980s, urban blight, flight, and prostitution were serious problems in much of downtown Columbus and adjacent neighborhoods.  Early efforts to halt the gradual deterioration of downtown began with the saving and lavish restoration of the 1996 Olympic softball competition, construction of Riverwalk park along the I-185 corridor. During the next several years, the expansion will continue starting with the growth at Fort Benning. Over the next several years more than 15,000 new troops will move to the Chattahoochee Valley.

==Geography and climate==
Columbus is located at  (32.489608, -84.940422).

According to the US Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 221.0&nbsp;square miles (572.4&nbsp;km²), of which, 216.3&nbsp;square miles (560.1&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 4.7&nbsp;square miles (12.3&nbsp;km²) of it (2.14%) is water.
