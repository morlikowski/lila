He then introduced Michaels into the ring and blamed him for his loss in an Elimination Chamber match that took place at Survivor Series the preceding year, which Michaels won. Before Michaels was able to respond to Jericho's comments, Jericho introduced Evolution, a group of wrestlers, that consisted of Triple H, Orton, and Ric Flair (Richard Fliehr). Triple H then discussed on how Michaels would not be able to win the Elimination Chamber match for the second consecutive year. Instead of responding vocally, Michaels, as apart of the scripted events, physically attacked Triple H, which resulted in an attack via all three members of Evolution.
