Het '''Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland''' is een staat in West-Europa gelegen tussen de Noordzee en de Atlantische Oceaan, met ongeveer 60,6 miljoen inwoners. In de moderne geschiedenis heeft deze staat als grootmacht een belangrijke rol gespeeld. 

De twee onderdelen van het Verenigd Koninkrijk omvatten in totaal vier gebieden die voortkomen uit de landen die in het koninkrijk zijn verenigd:
:Het eiland Groot-Brittannië omvat:
::1. Engeland in het zuiden (50.714.000 inwoners); 
::2. Schotland in het noorden (5.108.000 inwoners);
::3. Wales in het westen (2.977.000 inwoners);
:het noordoostelijk deel van het Ierse eiland vormt:
::4. Noord-Ierland (1.733.000 inwoners).
Deze gebieden hebben nog altijd een duidelijk herkenbare culturele, maar deels ook politieke identiteit, die hoorbaar is in de verschillende talen en dialecten die er gesproken worden, zichtbaar in onder meer vlaggen, bankbiljetten en plaatsnaamborden, en voor de bevolking bovendien voelbaar in recentelijk tot stand gekomen vormen van beperkt zelfbestuur in Noord-Ierland, Schotland en Wales. Dit alles laat evenwel onverlet, dat in onafhankelijke staat' zijn de 'landen binnen het koninkrijk' geen landen, maar in een wat ruimere betekenis van 'begrensd gebied met een politieke identiteit' wel. Gebruik makend van deze dubbele betekenis kan het Verenigd Koninkrijk worden aangeduid als 'vier landen in één land'.<ref>[http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page823.asp website Britse premier]</ref>

==Geschiedenis==

== Bestuurlijke indeling ==
In de laatste dertig jaar zijn er in het Verenigd Koninkrijk grote veranderingen in het lokaal bestuur geweest. De bestuurlijke indeling is bovendien voor elk van de landen binnen het koninkrijk weer anders geregeld.
*Engeland kent negen bestuurlijke regio's, die weer zijn onderverdeeld in 82 ''"stedelijke en niet-stedelijke graafschappen" (counties)''. 
*Noord-Ierland is onderverdeeld in 26 districten. 
*Schotland is onderverdeeld in 32 ''raadsgebieden (council areas)'', waarvan er drie uit eilanden bestaan (Westelijke Eilanden, Shetland). 
*Wales is onderverdeeld in 22 bestuurlijke gebieden, de ''principal areas''.

In Engeland wordt er onderscheid gemaakt tussen Newcastle, ''West Midlands'' met Birmingham, en ''West Yorkshire'' met Leeds) en de andere graafschappen (''non-metropolitan areas''). 

Het Verenigd Koninkrijk kent historisch een indeling in graafschappen (Engels: meervoud: counties, enkelvoud: county). De graafschappen binnen hun historische grenzen zijn nog bekend als de ''historische of traditionele graafschappen''.
* Graafschappen van Engeland
* Graafschappen van Schotland
* Graafschappen van Wales
* Graafschappen van Noord-Ierland

Deze graafschappen werden in het algemeen weer onderverdeeld in districten en die waren weer verder verdeeld in gemeenten (zie steden).

In Engeland en Wales zijn er nog bestuurlijke graafschappen, maar die hebben meestal andere grenzen dan de historische graafschappen.

=== Overzeese gebiedsdelen ===

* Anguilla
* Bermuda
* Brits Antarctisch Territorium
* Britse Maagdeneilanden
* Brits Indische Oceaan Territorium
* Caymaneilanden
* Falklandeilanden
* Gibraltar
* Montserrat
* Pitcairneilanden
* Sint-Helena
* Turks- en Caicoseilanden
* Zuid-Georgië en de Zuidelijke Sandwicheilanden

==Demografie==

== Geografie ==
Noord-Ierland vormen gezamenlijk het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland (''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''), gelegen op de Europese continent. Wales was al een onderdeel van Engeland voordat dit land samenging in het Verenigd Koninkrijk.

Ook een aantal kleinere eilanden hoort bij het koninkrijk: het eiland Wight (''Isle of Wight'', aan de zuidkant van Engeland), Lundy (tussen Devon en Wales), de ''Scilly-eilanden'' (ten zuidwesten van Engeland), Anglesey (aan de noordwestkant van Wales) en de eilandengroepen bij Schotland, waaronder de Hebriden, de Orkaden of Orkney-eilanden en de Shetland-eilanden. 

Het eiland Man (''Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney en Sark) horen hier in geografisch opzicht wel bij, maar zij horen formeel staatkundig niet tot het Verenigd Koninkrijk; zij hebben een aparte status als zogenaamde ''Dependencies of the Crown'' (onderhorig aan de Kroon). Ook maken ze geen deel uit van de Europese Unie, dit in tegenstelling tot het Verenigd Koninkrijk.

==Economie==

== Monetair ==
Munteenheid: ''Pound Sterling'' (GBP). Het pond is onderverdeeld in 100 pence (enkelvoud: penny). 

Het decimale stelsel werd ingevoerd in 1971. Voor die tijd bestond een pond uit 20 shilling en een shilling uit 12 pence, waardoor het pond dus 240 pence telde.

Hoewel het Verenigd Koninkrijk lid is van de euro pas ingevoerd zien wanneer het Verenigd Koninkrijk zijns inziens daartoe gereed is. Zijn voorganger Tony Blair was ook in principe voorstander van de invoering van de euro, maar heeft de beslissing daartoe steeds voor zich uitgeschoven, met hetzelfde argument.

== Staatsstructuur ==
Het Verenigd Koninkrijk is een Koningin in handen van de Premier en de overige ministers in diens kabinet. De monarch draagt geen politieke verantwoordelijkheid, om zo de eenheid en continuïteit van het staatsbestel te kunnen symboliseren.
=== Koninklijke familie ===
* Monarch sinds 1952: Koningin Elizabeth II
** De monarch is tevens formeel staatshoofd van zgn. Commonwealth realms, zoals Australië, Canada, Nieuw-Zeeland en Jamaica. Ook het Verenigd Koninkrijk is een Commonwealth realm. Zij is het Hoofd van het Gemenebest van Naties. Niet ieder lid van het Gemenebest erkent Koningin Elizabeth II als staatshoofd. Vele zijn oud-koloniën en nu republieken. Zij is ook Hoofd van de Britse Staatskerk: The Church of England (Anglicaanse Kerk).
* Prins-gemaal: Prins Philip.
* Troonopvolger: Prins Charles, daarna zijn oudste zoon, Prins William, daarna Prins Harry.
* Andere kinderen van Elizabeth en Philip: Prinses Anne, Prins Andrew, Prins Edward.

===Regering===
Het collectief van de premier en zijn ministers staat daarom bekend als ''Her Majesty's Government'' (Hare Majesteits Regering). Alle ministers zijn hun politieke loopbaan begonnen als parlementsleden en blijven dit ook als ze minister worden. Zij zijn verantwoording verschuldigd aan het Parlement, het wetgevende orgaan dat traditioneel als "oppermachtig" wordt beschouwd (dat wil zeggen, dat het wetten kan uitvaardigen op elk terrein en daarbij niet gebonden is aan besluiten van haar voorgangers). 

Er zijn wetten die voor wat betreft hun positie in de wettelijke rangorde ''de facto'' worden geacht met een grondwettelijke kracht te zijn bekleed, maar het Verenigd Koninkrijk is nog steeds een van de weinige landen ter wereld zonder een gecodificeerde grondwet, ofwel ongeschreven grondwet.

Niettemin wordt het Verenigd Koninkrijk tot de meest stabiele democratieën ter wereld gerekend. De strijdkrachten vormen geen zelfstandige politieke factor. Drastische wijzigingen in de politieke structuur, noch langs revolutionaire, noch langs legale weg, zoals Frankrijk sinds 1789 regelmatig heeft gehad, zijn voorgekomen sinds de 'Glorious Revolution' van 1688. Ontwikkelingen in de bevoegdheden van de monarch, de premier, de ministers en de beide kamers van het parlement zijn sindsdien altijd geleidelijk gegaan. Regeringen zitten bijna altijd een termijn van vier jaar uit, omdat zij dankzij het kiesstelsel meestal kunnen rekenen op een comfortabele meerderheid, die zelden uit meer dan één partij bestaat. Dat deze comfortabele meerderheid zelden of nooit steunt op een meerderheid van de kiezers, wordt niet als een ernstig probleem ervaren. De personele samenstelling van de regering is echter flexibel. De premier heeft veel macht, meer dan bijvoorbeeld in Nederland. Er hoeven geen coalitiepartners te vriend gehouden te worden; oppositiepartijen hoeven zelfs niet als toekomstige coalitiepartners te worden ontzien. Interne spanningen kan de premier oplossen door ministers te ontslaan of over te plaatsen. De ministeries van Financiën en Buitenlandse Zaken worden als de meest prestigieuze beschouwd; tijdens de 'troebelen' in Noord-Ierland vanaf het eind van de jaren zestig, toen direct bestuur vanuit Londen noodzakelijk werd, fungeerde het ministerie van Noord-Ierse zaken als een soort strafbankje. Twee jaar na het aantreden van een nieuwe regering vindt er daarnaast een traditionele 'midterm reshuffle' plaats, waarbij de premier alle ministers bij zich roept en hen meedeelt of ze hun baan kunnen behouden of niet. De laatste keer dat een premier zelf voortijdig moest aftreden om politieke redenen was in 1990 (Margaret Thatcher, vanwege de impopulaire 'poll tax'), daarvoor in 1957 (Anthony Eden, na de Suez-crisis) en daarvoor in 1940 (Neville Chamberlain, na het failliet van zijn appeasement-politiek en de ernstige nederlagen tegen Nazi-Duitsland). Dit betekende evenwel geen regeringscrisis met vervroegde verkiezingen; een opvolger nam het over en zat de regeringstermijn uit. Churchill, de opvolger van Chamberlain, stelde de verkiezingen zelfs vijf jaar uit tot na het einde van de Tweede Wereldoorlog.

=== Wetgevende macht ===
De opstelling van de Magna Carta in 1215 wordt wel gezien als het beginpunt van de Britse parlementaire democratie. Het parlement, gevestigd in het palace of Westminster, is daarmee een van de oudste ter wereld (vermoedelijk is alleen die van IJsland ouder) en wordt ook wel de 'moeder van alle parlementen' genoemd. Het bestaat uit twee kamers, waarvan de rollen zich in de loop der eeuwen hebben ontwikkeld:<br>
Het '''Lagerhuis (House of Commons)''', waarvan de leden (Members of Parliament) telkens voor maximaal vijf jaar gekozen worden; in de praktijk is het maximaal vier jaar, maar ook zelden korter, al heeft de minister-president het recht op elk gewenst moment binnen de vijfjaartermijn algemene verkiezingen uit te schrijven. Belangrijke verschillen met de Nederlandse Tweede Kamer zijn:<br>
* de ministers zijn ook lid van het Lagerhuis of het Hogerhuis; de regering is dus meer het uitvoerend orgaan van het parlement dan een onafhankelijke uitvoerende macht die gecontroleerd wordt door de wetgevende macht.
* bij de twee grootste partijen is er een door de politieke leiders vastgestelde, maar niet wettelijk vastgelegde rangorde tussen parlementsleden: 'front benchers' en 'backbenchers'; 'frontbenchers' zitten op de voorste rijen aan weerszijden van het gangpad tussen de regeringspartij en de oppositie, de 'backbenchers' verder naar achteren. Het gangpad is twee zwaardlengten breed en dit mag tijdens zittingen nooit door parlementsleden overgestoken worden, zulks om handtastelijkheden te voorkomen. De premier en de ministers zijn altijd frontbenchers van de regeringspartij; bij de grootste oppositiepartij zijn frontbenchers ''schaduwministers'', die het ''schaduwkabinet'' vormen. De schaduwministers concentreren zich op de portefeuille van een zittende minister, om die kritisch te volgen. Als zijn oppositiepartij de verkiezingen wint, is de schaduwminister de meest waarschijnlijke kandidaat voor die portefeuille. De politieke leider van de grootste oppositiepartij is de ''schaduwpremier''. Het verliezen van de verkiezingen door die partij leidt meestal tot het aftreden van de schaduwpremier, die dan weer 'backbencher' wordt, als hij tenminste gekozen is in zijn eigen district. (In Nederland is er in het begin van de jaren 70 ook even sprake geweest van een schaduwkabinet, met Joop den Uyl als schaduwpremier, maar het is geen traditie geworden.) Een premier die de verkiezingen verliest, verhuist meestal snel naar het Hogerhuis, en wordt benoemd in de Orde van de Kousenband.

* in plaats van een systeem van evenredige vertegenwoordiging, waarin elke kiezer op een elke kandidaat van elke partij kan stemmen, is er een meerderheidsstelsel, waarbij het hele koninkrijk is verdeeld in 646 kiesdistricten, waar elke partij hoogstens 1 kandidaat kan stellen; de kandidaat met de meeste stemmen, ook al is dat minder dan 50% van de uitgebrachte stemmen in dat district, wordt gekozen om het hele district in het Lagerhuis te vertegenwoordigen. Het leidt meestal tot een comfortabele meerderheid in het Lagerhuis voor de grootste partij, die dus een stabiele regering kan vormen; een voortijdige val van het hele kabinet is zeer zeldzaam. 
<br>
Het '''Hogerhuis (House of Lords)''', bestond tot voor kort deels uit adellijke personen op wie het lidmaatschap erfelijk was overgegaan (zgn. hereditary peers), deels uit zgn. 'life peers': personen met een adellijke titel voor het leven, dus niet erfelijk, door de zittende regering voor het leven benoemd wegens bijzondere verdiensten voor de samenleving. In de praktijk blijken donaties aan politieke partijen ('cash for honours') nog al eens een rol te spelen. Ex-premiers en bisschoppen van de Anglicaanse Kerk zijn automatisch lid. In 2001 werd een begin gemaakt met modernisering van het lidmaatschapsbeleid van het Hogerhuis. Omdat Hogerhuisleden niet gekozen worden, ook niet indirect, zoals in de Nederlandse Eerste Kamer, wordt het onbehoorlijk geacht de regering echt dwars te zitten. Het politieke nut van het Hogerhuis is dan ook omstreden.

=== Politieke partijen ===
De politieke partijen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk zijn:
* British National Party
* Conservative Party
* Democratic Unionist Party (alleen in Noord-Ierland)
* Green Party
* Labour Party
* Liberal Democrats
* Plaid Cymru (alleen in Wales)
* RESPECT
* Scottish National Party (alleen in Schotland)
* Scottish Senior Citizens Union Party (alleen in Schotland)
* Scottish Socialist Party (alleen in Schotland)
* Sinn Féin (alleen in Noord-Ierland)
* Social Democratic and Labour Party (alleen in Noord-Ierland)
* Socialist Workers' Party
* United Kingdom Independence Party
* Ulster Unionist Party (alleen in Noord-Ierland)

In feite kent het Verenigd Koninkrijk, zoals de Verenigde Staten, een tweepartijenstelsel. De twee grootste partijen, Labour en de Conservatives (Tories), maken om beurten de dienst uit.

===Politieke cultuur===
De parlementaire debatcultuur wordt gekenmerkt door meer retorisch vuurwerk, het uitjouwen van tegenstanders, het met de vuisten op de tafels trommelen en 'hear, hear' roepen als betuiging van instemming met een andere spreker. Dit alles wijkt af van de verambtelijkte sfeer in de parlementen van veel andere westerse democratieën. De voorzitter van het parlement, de 'speaker', roept wel regelmatig 'order, order', maar dat heeft voornamelijk rituele betekenis. De conventie om elkaar steevast aanspreken als 'right honourable friend' (als het leden van de eigen partij zijn) en 'right honourable gentleman/lady' (leden van andere partijen), ook bij de felste debatten, steekt daarbij wat ongerijmd af. Valt iemand uit zijn rol, door een tegenstander bijv. 'you sniveling git' te noemen, dan is dat nieuws. Televisiecamera's worden pas sinds de jaren tachtig toegelaten; sommige politici, waaronder Margaret Thatcher, waren beducht voor ondermijning van het gezag van het parlement vanwege de schijnbaar chaotische gang van zaken in het parlement.<br>
Britse politici komen relatief vaak wegens seksschandalen in opspraak, niet zozeer omdat zij zich in dat opzicht ernstiger misdragen dan in andere landen, maar omdat privé en politiek in de Britse cultuur minder gescheiden zijn. De boulevardpers, die zeer grote oplagen haalt, maakt hier veel werk van. Het beruchtste naoorlogse Profumo-affaire in 1963.<br>
Een al eeuwenlang goed ontwikkeld aspect van het publieke debat zijn satire en cartoons. Politici en ook leden van het koninklijk huis worden over het algemeen harder aangepakt dan in andere landen waar vrijheid van meningsuiting grondwettelijk gegarandeerd is. Politici worden geacht dit met stoïcijnse onverschilligheid te ondergaan, wat niet altijd lukt. Spitting Image is niet toevallig een Britse tv-productie die wereldwijde verbreiding en navolging heeft gekregen, zij het van kortere duur en soms in wat gekuiste vorm.

==Sport==
Engeland en Schotland hebben veel sporten en spelen uitgevonden die wereldwijd verbreid zijn: 

rugby, golf en cricket. De wereldwijde verbreiding van cricket beperkt zich tot het Britse Gemenebest.

De binnensporten snooker en darten worden wel veel gespeeld in Engelse pubs, en nationale kampioenschappen krijgen een overvloed aan zendtijd in de media, maar zijn in het buitenland nauwelijks aangeslagen. Een niet-Engelse dartkampioen als de Nederlander Raymond van Barneveld is een hoge uitzondering.

As a result of the empire, British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies such as Canada, Australia, India, and the United States. Queen Elizabeth II remains the head of the Commonwealth of Nations and head of state of each of the Commonwealth realms.

The UK is a fifth (nominal GDP) or sixth (PPP) largest economy in the world. It was the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th century,<ref></ref> but the economic cost of two world wars and the decline of its empire in the latter half of the 20th century diminished its leading role in global affairs. The UK nevertheless retains strong  economic, cultural, military and political influence and is a nuclear power, with the second or third (depending on method of calculation) highest defence spending in the world. It is a member state of the WTO and the Commonwealth of Nations.

In its first century, the United Kingdom played an important role in developing Western ideas of the slave trade, though the passing of the 1807 Slave Trade Act made the UK the first country to prohibit trade in slaves.

After the defeat of Napoleon in the Napoleonic Wars, the UK became the principal naval power of the 19th century. The United Kingdom remained an eminent power into the mid-20th century, and its empire expanded to its maximum size by 1921, gaining the League of Nations mandate over former German and Ottoman colonies after World War I.

Long simmering tensions in Ireland led to the partition of the island in 1920, followed by independence for the counties of the province of changed to the current name in 1927 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.<ref name="CAIN"></ref>

After Marshall aid, the UK began the road to recovery.

The immediate post-war years saw the establishment of the British health services, while the demands of a recovering economy brought people from all over the Commonwealth to create a multiethnic Britain. Although the new post-war limits of Britain's language meant the continuing impact of its literature and oil revenues and economic growth. The premiership of Margaret Thatcher marked a significant change of direction from the post-war political and economic consensus; a path that was continued by the New Labour government of Tony Blair in 1997.

The end of the 20th century saw a major change to the government of the United Kingdom with the creation of a devolved referenda. This produced the prospect of a legislative path to independence for Scotland when the 2007 election and formed a minority government in Scotland, with a mandate to hold a referendum on independence by 2011.

== Government and politics ==

The United Kingdom is a Queen Elizabeth II as head of state; the monarch of the UK also serves as head of state of fifteen other Commonwealth countries, putting the UK in a Crown has sovereignty over the Isle of Man and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey. Collectively, these three territories are known as the Crown dependencies, lands owned by the British monarch but not part of the United Kingdom. They are not part of the European Union. However, the Parliament of the United Kingdom has the authority to legislate for the dependencies, and the British government manages their foreign affairs and defence.

The UK has fourteen overseas territories around the world, the last remaining territories of the British Empire. The overseas territories are not considered part of the UK, but in most cases the local populations have British citizenship and the right of abode in the UK. This has been the case since 2002.

The UK has a parliamentary government based on strong traditions: the Westminster system has been emulated around the world — a legacy of the British Empire.

The UK's constitution governs the legal framework of the country and consists mostly of written sources, including British Parliament can perform "constitutional reform" simply by passing power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution. However, no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change.<ref></ref> The United Kingdom is one of the three countries in the world today that does not have a codified constitution (the other two being New Zealand and Israel).<ref></ref>

The position of Prime Minister, the UK's House of Commons, usually the current leader of the largest political party in that chamber. The Prime Minister and Cabinet are formally appointed by the Monarch to form Cabinet is traditionally drawn from members of the Prime Minister's party in both legislative houses, and mostly from the House of Commons, to which they are responsible. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, all of whom are sworn into Ministers of the Crown. ''The Rt Hon'' Labour Party, has been Prime Minister, First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service since 27 June 2007.

thumb|The [[Houses of Parliament]]
The Scotland and devolved assemblies in Northern Ireland, and Wales were established following public approval as expressed in referenda, but these are not sovereign bodies and could be abolished by the UK parliament. The UK parliament is made up of two houses: an elected House of Commons and an appointed assent of HM The Queen to become law. For elections to the House of Commons, the UK is currently divided into 646 constituencies, with 529 in England, 18 in Northern Ireland, 59 in Scotland and 40 in Wales, though this number will rise to 650 at the next General Election. Each constituency elects one Member of Parliament by simple plurality. General Elections are called by the Monarch when the Prime Minister so advises. Though there is no minimum term for a Parliament, a new election must be called within five years of the previous general election.

For elections to the European Parliament, the UK has 78 MEPs, elected in 12 multi-member constituencies. Questions over sovereignty have been brought forward due to the UK's membership of the European Union.<ref name=Times20050914></ref>

The UK's three major political parties are the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, and the Ireland). In accordance with party policy, no elected Sinn Féin Member of Parliament has ever attended the House of Commons to speak in the House on behalf of their constituents as Members of Parliament are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Monarch. However, the current five Sinn Féin MPs have since 2002 made use of the offices and other facilities available at Westminster.<ref></ref>

England, despite being the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no devolved executive or legislature and is ruled and legislated for directly by the UK government and parliament. This situation has given rise to the so-called West Lothian question which concerns the fact that MPs from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales help decide the laws that apply to England alone.

Following their victory at the 2007 elections, the pro-independence SNP formed a minority government with its leader, Commission to examine the case for devolving additional powers while excluding Scottish independence as an option,<ref></ref> though the leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Wendy Alexander, has now indicated that Labour will support calls for independence to be placed before the people in a referendum in the hope that a vote to reject independence would settle the constitutional debate for a generation.<ref></ref> Most opinion polls do show minority support for independence though support varies depending on the nature of the question.  However, a poll in April 2008 that used the proposed referendum wording found support for independence had reached 41% with just 40% supporting retention of the Union.<ref></ref>

The powers devolved to the 2007 elections, following a brief period of minority administration, when government under the continuing leadership of First Minister Rhodri Morgan.

The Northern Ireland Assembly has powers closer to those already devolved to Scotland. The Northern Ireland Executive is currently led by First Minister Peter Robinson (Democratic Unionist Party) and deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness (Sinn Féin).<ref>http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/your-government/devolved-government.htm Northern Ireland Executive</ref>

=== Local government ===

thumb|upright|[[Manchester Town Hall houses the Manchester City Council.]]
Each country of the United Kingdom has its own system of local government, with power over local government in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland being devolved. (City status, being governed by Royal Charter, is conferred separately from local government arrangements.)

England's upper-tier subdivisions are the nine Regions also known as European Union government office regions. A London referendum in 1998 on the question of having a directly elected assembly and directly elected mayor produced a large majority in favour and it was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected regional assemblies.  However, a rejection by a referendum in 2004 of a proposed assembly in the North East region stopped this idea in its tracks.<ref>"The Government is now expected to tear up its twelve-year-old plan to create eight or nine regional assemblies in England to mirror devolution in Scotland and Wales."</ref> Below the region level, county councils and district councils or unitary authorities.

Northern Ireland is presently divided into 26 districts for local government purposes though these councils do not carry out the same range of functions as would be the case in the rest of the United Kingdom.  However, on 13 March 2008, the Executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils to replace the present system.<ref>[http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/news/news-doe/news-doe-130308-foster-announces-the.htm ''Foster announces the future shape of local government'', NI Executive]</ref>

Scotland is divided into 32 council areas with wide variation in both size and population. The cities of Provost or Convenor to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area.

Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities, including the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport which are separate unitary authorities in their own right.

Despite the United Kingdom's military capabilities, recent pragmatic defence policy has a stated assumption that "the most demanding operations" would be undertaken as part of a coalition.<ref>Office for National Statistics ''UK 2005: The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', p. 89 </ref> Setting aside the intervention in Sierra Leone, operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq may all be taken as precedent. Indeed the last war in which the British military fought alone was the Falklands War of 1982, in which they were victorious.

== Law and criminal justice ==

The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system due to it being created by the political union of previously independent countries with Article 19 of the Northern Ireland law and Scots law. Recent constitutional changes will see a new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom come into being in October 2009 that will take on the appeal functions of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords.<ref>, Department for Constitutional Affairs. Retrieved on 2006-05-22</ref> The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, comprising the same members as the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the UK overseas territories, and the British crown dependencies.

=== England, Wales and Northern Ireland ===

Both Northern Ireland law are based on common-law principles. The essence of common-law is that law is made by Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice (for civil cases) and the Crown Court (for criminal cases). The Appellate Committee of the House of Lords (usually just referred to, as "The House of Lords") is presently the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil cases in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the hierarchy.

Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995 though, since that peak, there has been an overall fall of 48% in crime from 1995 to 2007/8.<ref></ref> Despite the fall in crime rates, the Ministry of Justice, manages most of the prisons within England and Wales.

=== Scotland ===

civil-law principles, applies in Scotland.  The chief courts are the Court of Session, for civil cases, and the High Court of Justiciary, for criminal cases. The Appellate Committee of the House of Lords (usually just referred to as "The House of Lords") presently serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law but only if the Court of Session grants leave to appeal or the initial judgement was by a majority decision. Sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury, known as Sheriff solemn Court, or with a Sheriff and no jury, known as (Sheriff summary Court). The Sheriff courts provide a local court service with 49 Sheriff courts organised across six Sheriffdoms.

The Scots legal system is unique in having three possible guilty", "not guilty" and "''not proven''". Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an acquittal with no possibility of retrial. The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) manages the prisons in Scotland which contain between them over 7,500 prisoners.<ref></ref> The Cabinet Secretary for Justice is responsible for the Scottish Prison Service within the Scottish Government.

== Geography ==

thumb|UK's topography
The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately  comprising of the island of Great Britain, the northeastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland (Northern Ireland) and smaller islands.  It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, coming within  of the northwest coast of France, from which it is separated by the Ireland. 

The United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with plentiful rainfall all year round. The temperature varies with the seasons but seldom drops below  or rises above . The prevailing wind is from the southwest, bearing frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean. Eastern parts are most sheltered from this wind and are therefore the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the Gulf Stream, bring mild winters, especially in the west, where winters are wet, especially over high ground. Summers are warmest in the south east of England, being closest to the European mainland, and coolest in the north. Snowfall can occur in winter and early spring, though it rarely settles to great depth away from high ground.

England accounts for just over half of the total area of the UK, covering . Most of the country consists of lowland terrain, and mountainous terrain north-west of the Humber Estuary. England's highest mountain is Larger Urban Zones, has six of the top 50 Zones in the European Union.

thumb|[[Ben Nevis, in the Grampian Mountains, is the highest point in the British Isles]]
Scotland accounts for about a third of the total area of the UK, covering .<ref></ref> The topography of Scotland is distinguished by the geological rock fracture which traverses the Scottish mainland from Highlands to the north and west and the lowlands to the south and east. The more rugged Highland region contains the majority of Scotland's mountainous terrain, including the highest peak, Central Belt. capital and political centre of the country. Scotland also has nearly eight hundred islands, mainly west and north of the mainland, notably the Hebrides, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.

Wales accounts for less than a tenth of the total area of the UK, covering just . Wales is mostly mountainous though South Wales is less mountainous than North and Mid Wales. The main population and industrial areas are in South Wales, consisting of the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport and surrounding South Wales Valleys.  The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia, and include Snowdon (''Yr Wyddfa'' in Welsh), which, at 1,085&nbsp;m (3,560&nbsp;ft) is the highest peak in Wales. The 14 (or possibly 15) Welsh mountains over 3,000 feet (914&nbsp;m) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s. Wales borders England to the east and the sea in the other three directions: the Bristol Channel to the south, St George's Channel to the west, and the Irish Sea to the north. Wales has over 1,200&nbsp;km (750&nbsp;miles) of coastline. There are several islands off the Welsh mainland, the largest being Anglesey (''Ynys Môn'') in the northwest.

Northern Ireland accounts for just  and is mostly hilly. It includes Lough Neagh, at , the largest body of water in the UK and Ireland.<ref></ref> The highest peak is Slieve Donard at  in the province's Mourne Mountains.

=== Cities and conurbations ===

The capitals of the individual countries of the UK are: Belfast (Northern Ireland), Cardiff (Wales), Edinburgh (Scotland) and  London (England), which is also the capital of the UK as a whole.

The largest conurbations are as follows:
* Greater London Urban Area - 8.28 million
* West Midlands conurbation - 2.28 million

In contrast with some other European countries, high foreign-born immigration is contributing to a rising population,<ref></ref> accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001. The latest official figures (2006) show net immigration to the UK of 191,000 (591,000 immigrants and 400,000 emigrants) up from 185,000 in 2005 (overall, there was a loss of 126,000 Britons and a gain of 316,000 foreign citizens).<ref></ref><ref name=ONS></ref><ref></ref> One in six were from Eastern European countries, with larger numbers coming from New Commonwealth countries.<ref></ref> Immigration from the Indian subcontinent, mainly fuelled by family reunion, accounted for two-thirds of net immigration.<ref></ref> By contrast, at least 5.5 million British-born people are living abroad.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> The most popular emigrant destinations were Australia, Spain, France, New Zealand and the U.S.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

In 2004, the number of people who became British citizens rose to a record 140,795 - a rise of 12% on the previous year. This number had risen dramatically since 2000.

Though the UK does not ''English, a Norman French and Latin. The English language has spread across the world (largely due to the British Empire) and has thus become the business language of the world. Worldwide, it is taught as a second language more than any other.<ref></ref>

The other indigenous languages of the UK are Scots (which is closely related to English) and four Welsh and Cornish); and two Q-Celtic languages (Irish and Gaelic still spoken in Nova Scotia, Canada, and Welsh in Patagonia, Argentina.

Immigrant languages constitute for up to 10% of the UK's population, French is spoken by 2.3% of the country's population, 1.0% of Britons speak Polish reflecting the recent mass migration to the UK. 0.9% of the UK's population speak German and 0.8% Spanish. The majority of other foreign languages spoken in the UK originate from Europe, Asia and Africa. A large percentage of the immigrants to the UK come from Anglophone countries (such as Nigeria, Jamaica, Hong Kong and the Philippines), which is why there is not a great deal of diversity between some of the country's ethnic minority communities.

Across the United Kingdom, it is generally compulsory for pupils to study a foreign language to some extent: up to the age of 14 in England, up to age 16 in Scotland. French and German are the two most commonly taught second languages in England and Scotland, though Welsh is the main second language taught in Wales. According to a survey in 2003, 89% of British people have a basic level of French language, and a further 23% have a basic knowledge of German. Other languages becoming more popular include 7% Spanish and 0.5% Russian.

=== Religion ===

While the United Kingdom has a long tradition of church and state still remains in England, research suggests that only 38% have a belief in a God with another 40% believing instead in a 'spirit or life force'.<ref name=Eurobarometer>.

The Church of Scotland (known informally as the Kirk), which broke with Rome in 1560 (see Calvinism and Scottish Reformation) is a Presbyterian church, recognised as the national church of Scotland, and not subject to state control. The British monarch is an ordinary member, and is required to swear an oath to "defend the security" of the Church at the coronation. The Scottish Episcopal Church, which is now part of the Anglican Communion, dates from the final establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1690, when it split from the Church of Scotland, and is not a 'daughter church' of the Church of England. Further splits in the Church of Scotland, especially in the nineteenth century, led to the creation of various other Presbyterian churches in Scotland, including the Free Church of Scotland.

In the 1920s, the disestablished'. The Church in Wales remains in the Anglican Communion. Methodism and other independent churches are traditionally strong in Wales.

The UK economy is made up (in descending order of size) of the economies of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The British started the Industrial Revolution, and, like most industrialising countries at the time, initially concentrated on heavy industries such as shipbuilding, coal mining, steel production, and textiles. The empire created an overseas market for British products, allowing the United Kingdom to dominate international trade in the 19th century. However, as other nations industrialised, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. The British service sector, however, has grown substantially, and now makes up about 73% of GDP.<ref></ref>

The service sector of the United Kingdom is dominated by Docklands area, with Barclays Bank relocating their head offices there. Many multinational companies that are not primarily UK-based have chosen to site their European or rest-of-world headquarters in London: an example is the US financial services firm Citigroup. The Scottish capital, Edinburgh, has one of the large financial centres of Europe.<ref></ref>

international business and commerce and is the leader of the three "command centres" for the global economy (along with New York City and Tokyo).<ref></ref> In recent years, the UK economy has been managed in accordance with principles of market liberalisation and low taxation and regulation. Based on market exchange rates, the United Kingdom is the fifth largest economy in the world,<ref></ref> and the second largest in Europe after Germany.

Tourism is very important to the British economy. With over 27 million tourists arriving in 2004, the United Kingdom is ranked as the sixth major tourist destination in the world.<ref>. UNWTO Tourism Highlights, Edition 2005 Page 12. World Tourism Organisation. Retrieved on 24 May 2006</ref>

The British manufacturing sector, however, has greatly diminished, relative to the economy as a whole, since World War II. It is still a significant part of the economy, but only accounted for one-sixth of national output in 2003.<ref></ref> The Rolls-Royce holds a major share of the global aerospace engines market. The chemical and pharmaceutical industry is strong in the UK, with the world's second and sixth largest pharmaceutical firms (GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, respectively)<ref></ref> being based in the UK.

The creative industries accounted for 7.3% GVA in 2004 and grew at an average of 5% per annum between 1997 and 2004.<ref></ref>

The United Kingdom's agriculture sector accounts for only 0.9% of the country's GDP.<ref></ref>

The UK has a small coal reserve along with significant natural gas, and oil reserves.

Government involvement throughout the economy is exercised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (currently Alistair Darling) who heads HM Treasury, but the Prime Minister (currently ''The Rt Hon'' Gordon Brown MP), is First Lord of the Treasury; the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the Second Lord of the Treasury. However since 1997, the Bank of England, headed by the Governor of the Bank of England, has control of interest rates and other monetary policy.

As of 2007, United Kingdom's government debt rose to 43.3% of GDP.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uk.html#Econ United Kingdom - Economy] CIA - The World Factbook</ref>

The currency of the UK is the £'''. The Bank of England is the central bank, responsible for issuing currency. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover the issue. The UK chose not to join the euro at the currency's launch, and the British Prime Minister, ''The Rt Hon'' Gordon Brown MP, has ruled out membership for the foreseeable future, saying that the decision not to join had been right for Britain and for Europe.<ref></ref> The government of former Prime Minister Tony Blair had pledged to hold a public referendum for deciding membership should "five economic tests" be met. In 2005, more than half (55%) of the UK were against adopting the currency, while 30% were in favour.<ref></ref>

== Education ==

Each country of the United Kingdom has a separate education system, with power over education matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland being devolved. 

post-secondary (further education) level are provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority and delivered through various schools, colleges and other centres. Scotland first legislated for universal provision of education in 1696. The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just over 4% though it has been rising slowly in recent years.<ref></ref> Scottish students who attend Scottish universities pay neither tuition fees nor graduate endowment charges as the fees were abolished in 2001 and the graduate endowment scheme was abolished in 2008.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7268101.stm MSPs vote to scrap endowment fee] BBC News, February 28, 2008</ref>

Local Education Authorities. Universal state education in England and Wales was introduced for primary level in 1870 and secondary level in 1900.<ref></ref> Education is mandatory from ages five to sixteen (15 if born in late July or August). The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, only a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. Despite a fall in actual numbers, the proportion of children in England attending Cambridge and Oxford had attended state schools.<ref></ref> State schools which are allowed to select pupils according to intelligence and academic ability can achieve comparable results to the most selective private schools: out of the top ten performing schools in terms of GCSE results in 2006 two were state-run Cambridge, Oxford, and London ranked amongst the top 20 in the 2007 THES - QS World University Rankings.<ref></ref> There are fears, however, that a decline in England in the number studying a foreign language will have a negative effect on business, and has led to calls for languages to be given greater priority.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

The Northern Ireland Assembly is responsible for education in Northern Ireland though responsibility at a local level is administered by 5 Education and Library Boards covering different geographical areas.

The Welsh and lessons in the language are compulsory for all until the age of 16. There are plans to increase the provision of Welsh Medium schools as part of the policy of having a fully bi-lingual Wales.

The Programme for International Student Assessment ranked the UK 14th in science which was higher than the OECD average.[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf]

== Healthcare ==

thumb|right|[[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. The NHS is the UK's publicly-funded healthcare system.]]
Each country of the United Kingdom has a separate public healthcare system, with power over the provision of health services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland being devolved. Though each provides healthcare that is generally free to patients, being funded from general taxation, considerable differences are now developing between the different systems.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems] BBC January 2, 2008</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7457357.stm  A four-way split on the NHS] BBC News, July 4, 2008</ref>  A much smaller private medical system also exists. The UK and devolved governments take on both the role of suppliers of public healthcare and assessors of the quality of its delivery.   Various regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and non-governmental-based (e.g. Royal Colleges). Across the UK, there is a large number of medical schools and dental schools, and a considerable establishment for training nurses and professions allied to medicine.

Though the public health systems are commonly referred to as the NHS across the UK, in fact the National Health Service just covers England. The NHS was set up by the National Health Service Act 1946 and came into effect on July 5, 1948. The Secretary of State for Health is answerable to the UK Parliament for the running of the Department of Health and for the work of the NHS (in England). The NHS is one of the largest cohesive organisations of any type in the world employing over 1.3 million people.<ref></ref> Public sector healthcare delivery consists of primary (General Practice), secondary (district general hospital) and tertiary (teaching hospital) levels of service.  There is considerable interaction and cross-flow between the various levels. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, or NICE, advises on whether drugs or treatments should be provided by the NHS.

Healthcare in Scotland is mainly provided by NHS Scotland, Scotland's public healthcare system. The service was founded by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947 (later repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) that took effect on July 5, 1948 to coincide with the launch of the NHS in England and Wales. In 2006, the NHS in Scotland had around 158,000 staff including more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. In addition, there were also more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health professionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who operate as independent contractors providing a range of services within the NHS in return for fees and allowances.<ref>[http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/introduction.aspx About the NHS in Scotland] NHS Scotland</ref> The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing is responsible to the Scottish Parliament for the work of NHS Scotland.

Healthcare in Wales is mainly provided by NHS Wales. It was originally formed as part of the same NHS structure created by the National Health Service Act 1946 but powers over the NHS in Wales came under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969.<ref>[http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?pid=11595&orgid=452 Introduction to NHS Wales 1960's] www.wales.nhs.uk </ref> In turn, responsibility for NHS Wales was passed to the Welsh Assembly and Executive under devolution in 1999. NHS Wales provides public healthcare in Wales and employs some 90,000 staff, making it Wales’ biggest employer.<ref>[http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?pid=11590&orgid=452 Introduction to NHS Wales - Staff] www.wales.nhs.uk </ref> The Minister for Health and Social Services is the person within the Welsh Assembly Government who holds cabinet responsibilities for both health and social care in Wales.

Healthcare in Northern Ireland is mainly provided by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.
