==History==
===Origins===
thumb|An [[Airspeed Consul (VR-SCD) the first aircraft type operated by Malayan Airways, which was the forerunner of Singapore Airlines]]

Singapore Airlines began with the incorporation of Malayan Airways Limited (MAL) on British Commonwealth airlines (such as Qantas Empire Airways) provided technical assistance, as well as assistance in joining public in 1957. Other aircraft operated in the first two decades included the Douglas DC-4 Skymaster, the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation, the de Havilland Comet 4 and the Fokker F27.

When Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, the airline's name was changed, from "Malayan Airways" to "Malaysian Airlines" (though still abbreviated to MAS). MAS also took over Borneo Airways. In 1966, following Singapore's separation from the federation, the airline's name was changed again, to Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA). The next year saw a rapid expansion in the airline's fleet and route, including the purchase of MSA's first Boeing aircraft, the Boeing 707s, as well the completion of a new high-rise headquarters in Singapore. Boeing 737s were added to the fleet soon after.

===Incorporation and growth===
thumb|right|A Singapore Airlines [[Boeing 747-400, dubbed ''Megatop'', at Auckland Airport, New Zealand. The ''Megatop'' was the flagship of the airline from 1989 until the introduction of the Airbus A380 in October 2007]]
MSA ceased operations in 1972, when political disagreements between Singapore and Malaysia resulted in the formation of two entities: Singapore Airlines and Malaysian Airlines System.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Singapore Airlines kept all 10 of MSA's Boeing 707s and 737s, retained the international routes out of Singapore as well as the existing corporate headquarters in the city, with J.Y. Pillay, former joint chief of MSA as its first chairperson. Female flight attendants continued to wear the ''sarong kebaya'' uniform, which had been first introduced in 1968. A local start up advertising company, Batey Ads was given the right to market the airline, eventually selecting the sarong and kebaya-clad air stewardesses as an icon for the airline and calling them Singapore Girls.

SIA saw rapid growth during the 1970s, adding cities in the Madrid becoming the first Hispanic city to be served by SIA.

Boeing 747-400s were introduced into the SIA fleet in 1989 and named ''Megatops''. They were later complemented by Boeing 777s, Airbus A310s and Airbus A340s. Services were extended to southern Africa in the 1990s, when the airline began flights to Johannesburg in South Africa. The cities of Cape Town and Durban were subsequently introduced to the route network.

===Modern history===
In 2004, SIA began non-stop trans-Pacific flights from Singapore to Newark, utilising the Airbus A340-500. These flights marked the first non-stop air services between Singapore and the USA. The Singapore to Newark flight is the record for the longest scheduled commercial flight, with a flying time of over 18 hours each way. Beginning in May 2008 Singapore Airlines will begin converting the five Airbus A340-500 to a business class model only for its routes to Newark and Los Angeles.<ref>http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-allbiz4mar04,1,3403241.story</ref>

At a Cabinet meeting on fifth freedom rights to Singapore Airlines on flights from Australia to the United States. Singapore Airlines had argued that transpacific flights from Australia suffered from under-capacity, leading to limited competition and relatively high air fares.  The move was seen as a measure taken to protect Qantas from increased competition. <ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/21/bloomberg/sxsia.php Australia rebuffs bid by Singapore Airlines International Herald Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> SIA had encountered such protectionist measures in the past when SIA was shut out from the Toronto market after complaints from Air Canada, and was forced to stop flying Boeing 747-400s into Jakarta in the wake of protests from Garuda Indonesia when it could not use similar equipment to compete.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/1991/11/23/sing_0.php Growing Pains at Singapore Airlines: Carrier's Expansion Is Running Into Global and Regional Competition - International Herald Tribune]</ref> 

====A380====
thumb|left|Singapore Airlines [[Airbus A380]]
On September 29, 2000, SIA announced an order for 25 Airbus A3XX (as the A380 was known at the time). The US$8.6 billion order comprised a firm order of 10 aircraft, with options on another 15 airframes.<ref>[http://www.a380.singaporeair.com/news_pr_20000929.html Singapore Airlines Announces US$8.6 Billion Airbus A3XX* Order]</ref> The order was confirmed by Singapore Airlines on July 12, 2001. 
In January 2005, the airline unveiled the slogan "First to Fly the A380 - Experience the Difference in 2006", to promote itself as the first airline to take delivery of the A380-800, which was expected to take place in the second quarter of 2006.<ref>[http://www.a380.singaporeair.com/news_pr_20050105.html SIA Reveals The "First to fly" Logo For Its A380]</ref> In June 2005, Airbus confirmed that due to unforeseen technical problems, initial deliveries of the Airbus A380 would be delayed by up to six months,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4598779.stm Airbus confirms super-jumbo delay] (BBC News: June 1, 2005)</ref> with the first delivery now slated for November 2006. The announcement was met with fury by SIA's chief executive officer, Chew Choon Seng, who threatened to sue Airbus, saying:

</ref>}}

He further stated that SIA will be turning its attention to Boeing instead, since it would be receiving the Boeing 777-300ER before the A380. Nevertheless, SIA has indicated that this would not affect its promotional campaign.

In February 2006, the first A380 in full Singapore Airlines livery was flown to Singapore, where it was displayed at Asian Aerospace 2006. On June 14, 2006, Singapore Airlines placed an initial order for the Boeing 787 as part of its future aircraft expansion. The order consisted of 20 787-9s and rights for 20 more. This order came one day after Airbus announced that the A380 superjumbo would be delayed by another 6 months.

A third delay was announced on 3 October 2006, pushing the initial delivery of the first A380 to October 2007. <ref>[http://www.airbus.com/en/presscentre/pressreleases/pressreleases_items/06_10_03_a380_delays_company_restructuring_plan.html Airbus Confirms Further A380 Delay and Launches Company Restructuring Plan] (Airbus: October 3, 2006)</ref>

On 25 October 2007, the first commercial A380 service, flight number SQ 380,<ref></ref> flew 455 passengers from Singapore to Sydney, touching down in Sydney Airport at 5:24 pm local time, where it received significant attention from the media.<ref></ref> The airline donated all revenue generated from the flight to three charities in a ceremony the next day in Sydney. SIA began regular services with the A380 on 28 October 2007.

==Corporate management==
Singapore Airlines is the parent airline company of the Singapore Airlines Group of companies.<ref></ref> The Singapore government investment and subsidiary companies.<ref></ref> Still, independent research typically rates the airline as practicing sound audited annual reports to dispel the notion that SIA receives state funding, subsidies or preferential treatment from the government, despite being a Government-linked company.<ref></ref>

===Structure===

Singapore Airlines has diversified into related industries and sectors, including ground handling, aircraft leasing, aviation engineering, air tour operations. It has also restructured itself by hiving off operational units as fully-owned subsidiaries to maintain its core business as a passenger airline.  The Singapore Airlines Group comprised 25 subsidiary companies, 32 associated companies, and two joint venture companies in the financial year ending 31 March 2007. SIA sold all its equity share of 35.5% in a joint venture, Singapore Aircraft Leasing Enterprise, to the Bank of China for US$980m on 15 December 2006<ref>[http://www.saleleasing.com/content_press_release.php?oid=press_release&limit=5# BOC Aviation]</ref>. There have recently been suggestions to divest SIA Engineering Company and Singapore Airport Terminal Services, two of SIA's largest subsidiaries. Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, for one, voiced his opinion in December 2005 that Singapore Airlines should divest these two companies to focus on its core business of air transportation.<ref></ref> Although Singapore Airlines has evaluated the divestment opportunity, no tentative plan has been announced to date.<ref></ref>

===Operational investments===
thumb|right|[[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-412 taking off from London Heathrow Airport]]
The airline has invested in other airlines in a bid to expand beyond its Singapore base, although the results are often financially negative. In 1989, it went into a tripartite alliance with New Zealand government bought into the airline to rescue it from bankruptcy, reducing Singapore Airlines' stake to 4.5%. This was subsequently sold in October 2004 at a substantial loss.

thumb|right|[[Boeing 747-400 lined up for take off at London Heathrow Airport, England]]
SIA bought a 49% stake in pounds in cash<ref></ref> in the hope of leveraging on it on the lucrative transatlantic market, but by 2007, there has been reports of underperformance and the possibility of divesting its stake.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKL0955460420070709?rpc=44 Report says Singapore Air may sell Virgin Atlantic stake | Reuters]</ref> On SIA invites offers for its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic]</ref>. In September 2004, the airline entered the [[low-cost carrier market by establishing Tiger Airways with a 49% stake, in partnership with Indigo Partners LLC, the investment firm founded by Bill Franke, (24%); Irelandia Investments Limited, the private investment arm of Tony Ryan and his family, (16%); and Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd (11%).

===Labour===
The Singapore Airlines Group employed a total of 29,457 staff members at the end of the fiscal year on 31 March 2007.<ref> </ref> The parent airline itself employed 13,942 (47.3%), of which there are 2,174 pilots and 6,914 cabin crew. The group's employees are represented by five labour unions, namely the Singapore Airlines Staff Union (SIASU), the SIA Engineering Company Engineers and Executives Union (SEEU), the Singapore Airport Terminal Services Workers' Union (SATSWU), the Air Transport Executives Staff Union (AESU) and the Air Line Pilots' Association Singapore (ALPA-S).

Relations between the labour unions and the group management has been testy at times, particularly after wage cuts, retrenchments, and early retirement affected staff morale during and after difficult economic conditions such as the SARS outbreak in 2003.<ref>[http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/showthread.php?t=279502 Low Morale at Singapore Airlines - Article in The Straits Times]</ref> The ALPA-S alone has been involved in no less than 24 disputes with group management since its registration in May 1981 (itself formed after its predecessor, the Singapore Airlines Pilots Association had 15 EXCO members charged and convicted for initiating illegal industrial action in 1980 in the wake of disputes with management and the SIAPA was deregistered on 26 February 1981) up to 30 November 2003, when the Ministry of Manpower amended the Trade Unions Act to overule an item in ALPA-S's constitution requiring formal ratification from the general membership for negotiation agreements involving the executive committee.<ref> [http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/press_room/press_releases/2003/20031130-PrimeMinistersOfficePressStatementImprovingLabourRelationsInSingaporeAirlines.html Prime Minister's Office Press Statement: Improving Labour Relations in Singapore Airlines (SIA)]</ref> In 2007, the airline was in the spotlight again when ALPA-S disagreed with the management's proposed salary rate for pilots flying the Airbus A380,<ref> [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/272407/1/.html SIA's latest offer in A380-pilot wage dispute rejected]</ref> and the case had to be settled by the Industrial Arbitration Court.<ref> [http://travel.asiaone.com/Travel/News/Story/A1Story20070609-13263.html SIA pilots reject last-ditch offer to settle A380 pay dispute]</ref> The salary ranges of SIA's pilots were made public during the first day of the hearings, and the press noted that the airline's 935 captains who fly the Boeing 777 received higher salaries (over S$270,000) at the mid-point of their salary brackets compared to the company's 36 vice-presidents (S$233,270).<ref> [http://travel.asiaone.com/Travel/News/Story/A1Story20070609-13259.html Boeing 777 captains get higher pay than SIA vice-presidents]</ref>

Disputes have also affected the unions, some so severe that they have attracted the intervention of the government. The internal feuding in ALPA-S which led to the ousting of the entire 22-member executive committee on 17 November 2003 was attributed to "internal politics" and theories that it may involve former pilots, including those involved in the deregistration of SIAPA.<ref> [http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/storyprintfriendly/0,1887,221800,00.html? <!-- You have to be a subscriber to read this news story! -->SQ pilots under political pressure]</ref> In January 2008, NTUC secretary-general Lim Swee Say spoke up against legal action by parties involved in an internal dispute in SIASU.<ref> [http://www.asiaone.com/News/The%2BStraits%2BTimes/Story/A1Story20080130-47296.html SIA union urged to settle internal feud]</ref>

On 2 April 2007 the airline group and its unions jointly launched the "Singapore Airlines Group Union-Management Partnership" and the Labour Movement 2011 (LM2011) in a bid to improve their relations, each pledging to be "pro-worker" and "pro-business" respectively.<ref> [http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/en_UK/content/company_info/press_release/JointReleaseOnLM2011.jsp Singapore Airlines Group Union-Management Partnership And LM2011]</ref> In April 2008, the airline's chairman Stephen Lee described the relations between management and the unions as "stable and cordial" in the last two years, with better communication between them. He alluded that several government figures, including Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, has intervened to help alleviate differences, and that there has been more regular meetings and exchanges between the two sides.<ref> [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/342550/1/.html SIA says state of ties between management and unions is stable]</ref>

==Branding==
thumb|right|[[flight attendant|Stewardesses, known as the Singapore Girls, are heavily marketed as the airline's icon.]]

Branding and publicity efforts have revolved primarily around flight crew,<ref> </ref> in contrast to most other airlines, who tend to emphasize aircraft and services in general. In particular, the promotion of stewardesses known as Singapore Girls has been widely successful and is a common feature in most of the airline's advertisements and publications. This branding strategy aims to build a mythical aura around the Singapore Girl, and portray her as representative of Asian hospitality and grace and the airline's training program for both cabin and technical flight crew complement this objective.

Dressed in a version of the Malay ''Sarong Kebaya'' designed by Pierre Balmain in 1968,<ref></ref> the uniform of the Singapore Girl has remained largely unchanged. Stewards wear light-blue business jackets and grey trousers.

Although a successful marketing image for the airline, the "Singapore Girl" emphasis received criticisms for its portrayal of women as subservient to males. Feminist groups say that its cultural references are outdated and that most Singaporean women today are modern and independent.<ref></ref>

On New York-based advertising agent S$50 million per year over the following five years. Stephen Forshaw, SIA's Vice-President of Public Affairs, said they will start the new branding campaign "as early as there is a practicable opportunity". This change in advertising agency will not affect SIA's buying media agency, which is presently MEC.<ref> </ref>

The livery of Singapore Airlines includes the "bird" (also known as the Silver Kris) logo on the tailfin, which has remained unchanged since Singapore Airlines' inception, but the logotype and stripes used since 1972 were changed in 1988 to the ones still in use today. The livery had a recent change, which saw the "Singapore Airlines" logotype enlarged and moved towards the front, in a similar fashion to the livery variant used on the Airbus A380, but the stripes and the "bird" remained the same.
