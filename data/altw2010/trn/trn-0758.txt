'''Józef Klemens Piłsudski''' (pólskur öðru pólska lýðveldinu auk þess að vera yfir aðalsfjölskyldu með rætur aftur til Stórfurstadæmisins Litháens og Pólsk-litháíska samveldisins. Frá miðri Fyrri heimsstyrjöld til dauðadags hafði hann mikil áhrif á ríkisstjórn Póllands og utanríkisstefnu. Hann var lykilmaður í því að Pólland fékk sjálfstæði árið 1918, 123 árum eftir að Pólsk-litháíska samveldið var þurrkað út af landakortum.

Hann var upphaflega meðlimur í pólska sósíalistaflokknum og leit á Pólsku sveitirnar sem börðust með Austurrísk-ungverska keisaradæminu og Þýska keisaradæminu til að tryggja ósigur Rússlands. Seinna meir dró hann stuðning sinn við Bandamenn. Eftir heimsstyrjöldina stjórnaði hann her Pólverja í Pólsk-sovéska stríðinu 1919 til 1921 og frá nóvember 1918, þegar Pólland fékk sjálfstæði, til 1922 var hann ríkisstjóri. 

lýðræðislega þjóðernisflokknum undirtökunum í Maíbyltinguna 1926 sneri hann aftur og varð í reynd einræðisherra. Til dauðadags hafði hann fyrst og fremst afskipti af málefnum hersins og utanríkismálum, en hugðist jafnframt minnka áhrif stjórnmálamanna (sem hann taldi spillta) og styrkja herinn. Meðferð hans á pólitískum andstæðingum vakti harða gagnrýni frá helstu bandalagslöndum Póllands. 

Eftir lát hans tók Edward Rydz-Śmigły við, í samræmi við hinstu óskir Piłsudskis, og stjórnin varð enn gerræðislegri.

Early in his political career, Piłsudski became a leader of the Polish Legions. In 1914 he anticipated the outbreak of a European war, the Roos 1966, p. 14; Rothschild 1990, p. 45.</ref>  When World War I broke out, he and his Legions fought alongside the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires to ensure Russia's defeat. Subsequently in 1917, with Russia faring badly in the war, he withdrew his support from the Central Powers.

From November 1918, when Poland regained independence, until 1922, Piłsudski was Poland's "Chief of State."  In 1919–21 he commanded Poland's forces in the National Democrats, he withdrew from active politics. Three years later he returned to power in the May 1926 ''coup d'état'', becoming ''de facto'' dictator of Poland. From then until his death in 1935, he concerned himself primarily with military and foreign affairs.

For at least thirty years until his death, Piłsudski pursued, with varying degrees of intensity, two complementary strategies, intended to enhance Poland's security: "Intermarum" federation, comprising Poland and several of her neighbors. Though a number of his political acts remain controversial, Piłsudski is held in high esteem by his compatriots.<ref name="TT_NGP"/><ref name="Goldfarb"/><ref name="Pozeg6"/><ref name="Roshwald">Roshwald 2002, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521013240&id=uteV3ytfmqQC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=Pilsudski+hero&sig=pUTn7o9EK83j--_aOWyiwKGkgPQ p. 60].</ref>

In 1892 Piłsudski returned from exile. In 1893 he joined the Polish Socialist Party (''PPS'')<ref name="Poland.gov"/> and helped organize its Lithuanian branch.<ref name="Urb 88">Urbankowski 1997, vol. 1, p. 88.</ref> Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible MacMillan 2003, p. 209.</ref> In 1894, as its underground socialist newspaper, ''Robotnik'' (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers, and, initially, a Urbankowski 1997, vol. 1, p. 93.</ref><ref name="Piłsudski12">Piłsudski 1989, p. 12.</ref> In 1895 he became a PPS leader, and took the position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and that socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, since that combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.<ref name="PWN"/>

The marriage deteriorated when, several years later, Piłsudski began an affair with a younger socialist,<ref name="MM-209"/>Aleksandra Szczerbińska. Maria died in 1921, and in October that year Piłsudski married Aleksandra. By then the pair had two little daughters, Wanda and Jadwiga. This marriage, too, was  troubled.<ref name="Aleksandra"></ref>

At the time, when almost all parties in Russian Poland and Lithuania took a conciliatory position toward the Russian Empire and aimed at negotiating within it a limited autonomy for Poland, Piłsudski's PPS was the only political force that was prepared to fight the Empire for Polish independence and to resort to violence in order to achieve that goal.<ref name=Pidl/>

In the fall of 1904, Piłsudski formed a Zamoyski 1987, p. 330.</ref> The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in Urbankowski 1997, vol. 1, pp. 113–116.</ref><ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.<ref name="Urb 117–118">Urbankowski 1997, vol. 1, pp. 117–18.</ref>

During the 1905 Russian Revolution, Piłsudski played a leading role in events in June Days," as the Łódź uprising came to be known, armed clashes broke out between Piłsudski's paramilitaries and gunmen loyal to Dmowski and his National Democrats.<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> On December 22, 1905, Piłsudski called for all Polish workers to rise up; the call went largely unheeded.<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/>

Unlike the National Democrats, Piłsudski instructed the PPS to boycott the elections to the Frakcja Rewolucyjna''"), while their opponents were known as the "Young Faction," "Moderate Faction" or "Left Wing" ("''Młodzi''," "''Frakcja Umiarkowana''," "''Lewica''"). The "Young" sympathized with the Social Democrats of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania and believed that priority should be given to cooperation with Russian revolutionaries in toppling the Tsarist regime and creating a socialist utopia that would facilitate negotiations for independence.<ref name="PWN"/>

Piłsudski and his supporters in the Revolutionary Faction continued to plot a revolution against Tsarist Russia that would secure Polish independence.<ref name="Poland.gov"/> By 1909 his faction would again be the majority in the PPS, and Piłsudski would remain one of the most important PPS leaders up to the outbreak of the First World War.<ref name="Urb 131">Urbankowski 1997, vol. 1, p. 131.</ref>

In 1906, Piłsudski, with the connivance of Austrian authorities, founded a military school in Urbankowski 1997, vol. 1, pp. 121–122.</ref><ref name="Zamoyski-332"/>

The paramilitaries also held up Russian currency transports leaving Polish territories. On the night of September 26–27, 1908, they robbed a Russian mail train carrying tax revenues from Warsaw to Saint Petersburg.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> Piłsudski, who took part in this Bezdany raid near Vilna, used the funds thus "expropriated" to finance his secret military organization<ref name="Britannica" />. The take from that single raid (200,812 rubles) was a fortune for the time and equaled the paramilitaries' entire takes of the two preceding years.<ref name="Urb 121–122"/>

In 1908 Piłsudski transformed his paramilitary units into an "Association for Active Struggle" (''Związek Walki Czynnej'', or ''ZWC''), headed by three of his associates, Władysław Sikorski, Marian Kukiel and Kazimierz Sosnkowski.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> One of the ''ZWC'''s main purposes was to train officers and noncommissioned officers for a future Polish Army.<ref name="PWN"/>

In 1910 two legal paramilitary organizations were created in the Austrian zone of Poland&mdash;one in Riflemen's Association, which served as cover to train a Polish military force. In 1912 Piłsudski (using the ''nom de guerre'', "''Mieczysław''") became commander-in-chief of a Riflemen's Association (''Związek Strzelecki'') that grew by 1914 to 12,000 men.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/><ref name="Poland.gov"/> In 1914, Piłsudski declared that "Only the sword now carries any weight in the balance for the destiny of a nation."<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/>

Soon afterward he officially established the Polish Legions, taking personal command of their First Brigade,<ref name="Poland.gov"/> which he would lead successfully into several victorious battles.<ref name="PWN"/> He also secretly informed the British government in the fall of 1914 that his Legions would never fight France or Britain, only Russia.<ref name="Cienciala"/>

The Polish Legions fought against Russia at the side of the Central Powers until 1917.

Soon after forming the Legions, also in 1914, Piłsudski set up another organization, the Polish Military Organisation (''Polska Organizacja Wojskowa''), which served as a precursor Polish intelligence agency and was designed to perform espionage and sabotage missions.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Cienciala"/>

Piłsudski agreed to serve in the "Kingdom of Poland" created by the Central Powers, and acted as Russian Revolution and in view of the worsening situation of the Central Powers, Piłsudski took an increasingly uncompromising stance, insisting that his men not be treated as "German Urbankowski 1997, vol. 1, p. 253.</ref><ref name="JR45"/> In the aftermath of a July 1917 "oath of loyalty to the Central Powers, he was arrested and imprisoned at Magdeburg; the Polish units were disbanded, and the men were incorporated into the Austro-Hungarian Army,<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref name="Cienciala"/> while the Polish Military Organization began attacking German targets.<ref name="PWN"/> Piłsudski's arrest greatly enhanced his reputation among Poles, many of whom began to see him as the most determined Polish leader, willing to take on ''all'' the partitioning powers.<ref name="PWN"/>

On November 8, 1918, Piłsudski and his comrade, Colonel Kazimierz Sosnkowski, were released from Magdeburg and soon—like Vladimir Lenin before them—placed on a private train, bound for their national capital, as the increasingly desperate Germans hoped that Piłsudski would gather forces friendly to them.<ref name="Cienciala"/>

===Rebuilding Poland===
thumb|right|''Ulica Mokotowska 50'', Warsaw, where Piłsudski stayed November 13–29, 1918, after release from [[Magdeburg]]
On November 11, 1918, in Warsaw, Piłsudski was appointed Commander in Chief of Polish forces by the Regency Council and was entrusted with creating a national government for the newly independent country. On that very day (which would become Poland's Independence Day), he proclaimed an independent Polish state.<ref name="Cienciala"/>

That week, too, Piłsudski also negotiated the evacuation of the German garrison from Warsaw and of other German troops from the "Urbankowski 1997, vol. 1, p. 256 and pp. 277–278.</ref>

On November 14, 1918, Piłsudski was asked to provisionally supervise the running of the country. On November 22 he officially received, from the new government of Jędrzej Moraczewski, the title of Provisional Chief of State (''Naczelnik Państwa'') of renascent Poland.<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

Various Polish military organizations and provisional governments (the Regency Council in Warsaw;   Ignacy Daszyński's government in Lublin; and the Polish Liquidation Committee in Kraków) bowed to Piłsudski, who set about forming a new coalition government. It was predominantly socialist and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the Polish Socialist Party, such as the eight-hour day, free school education, and women's suffrage. This was necessary to avoid major unrest.

However, Piłsudski believed that as head of state he must be above partisan politics.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Cienciala"/> The day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him socialist-style as "Mister'  [rather than continue using the socialist term of address, 'Comrade']!"<ref name="Poland.gov"/> He declined to support any one party and did not form any political organization of his own; instead, he advocated creating a coalition government.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Suleja202>Suleja 2004, p. 202.</ref> He also set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian and Austrian armies.

In the days immediately after World War I, Piłsudski attempted to build a government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%.<ref name="MM-210">MacMillan 2003, p. 210.</ref> A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported: "I have nowhere seen anything like the evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn".<ref name="MM-210"/>

In addition, the country had to unify the disparate systems of law, economics, and administration in the former German, Austrian and Russian sectors of Poland. There were nine legal systems, five currencies, 66 types of rail systems (with 165 models of locomotives), which all had to be consolidated on an expedited basis.<ref name="MM-210"/>

Wacław Jędrzejewicz, in ''Piłsudski: A Life for Poland'', describes Piłsudski as very deliberate in his decision-making. He collected all available pertinent information, then took his time weighing it before arriving at a final decision. Piłsudski drove himself hard, working all day and all night.<ref name="MM-210"/> He maintained a spartan lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant.<ref name="MM-210"/> Though Piłsudski was popular with much of the Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work), as a man who distrusted almost everyone, led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.<ref name="MM-209"/>

Piłsudski and the first Polish government were distrusted in the West because Piłsudski had cooperated with the Central Powers in 1914–17 and because the governments of Daszyński and Jędrzej Moraczewski were primarily socialist.<ref name="Cienciala"/> It was not until January 1919, when the world-famous pianist and composer Ignacy Paderewski became prime minister and foreign minister of a new government, that it was recognized in the West.<ref name="Cienciala"/>

That still left two separate governments claiming to be Poland's legitimate government: Piłsudski's in Warsaw, and Dmowski's in Paris.<ref name="MM-210"/> To ensure that Poland had a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Piłsudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Piłsudski acting as Provisional Chief of State and  Paris Peace Conference.<ref name="MM-213–214">MacMillan 2003, pp. 213–214.</ref> Articles 87–93 of the Versailles Treaty<ref>See articles 87–93, </ref> and the Grant 1999, [http://books.google.com/books?id=GAQ8vIJE8_QC&pg=PA114&dq=Poland+recognition+1919+versailles&as_brr=3&ei=ET9cR__8G6butAPi0NDvAw&sig=uc8xW0mfzxTFUDYohdfCEG5t81Q p. 114].</ref>

On February 20, 1919, Piłsudski declared that he would return his powers to the newly elected Polish parliament (''Sejm''). However, the ''Sejm'' reinstated his office in the Little Constitution of 1919. The word "Provisional" was struck from his title, and Piłsudski would hold the office until December 9, 1922, when Gabriel Narutowicz was elected the first president of Poland.<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

Piłsudski's major foreign-policy initiative at this time was a proposed Polish for "Between-Seas," and also known from the Baltic to the pre-partition Jędrzejewicz 1991.</ref><ref name="PWN"/>

Piłsudski's plan met with opposition from most of the prospective member states—who refused to relinquish any of their hard-won independence—as well as from the Allied powers, for whom it would be too bold a change to the existing balance-of-power structure.<ref>{{cite web

However, while Ukrainians were the first clear enemy, it soon became apparent that the various Ukrainian factions were not the real power in that region. Coming months and years would show that the Bolsheviks were in fact the most dangerous enemy not only of renascent Poland, but of the Ukrainians.

Piłsudski was aware that the Bolsheviks were no friends of independent Poland, and that war with them was inevitable.<ref name="Urb 90–2">Urbankowski 1997, vol. 2, p. 90.</ref> He viewed their advance west as a major problem, but also considered the Bolsheviks less dangerous for Poland than their Russian-civil-war contenders.<ref name="Kenez">Kenez 1999, [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0521311985&id=aIY9qb6iIEcC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=%22Peace+of+Riga%22&sig=DOZgge7R-dNB7KTNOVV_QWrE8KI p. 37].</ref> These "White Russians"—representative of the old Russian Empire—were willing to accept only limited independence for Poland, probably within borders similar to those of the former Urbankowski 1997, vol. 2, p. 83.</ref>

Piłsudski's plan called for Polish forces to withdraw across the divisions concentrated to the south for a strategic counter-offensive. The plan next required two armies under General Józef Haller, facing Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east, to hold their entrenched positions at all costs. At the same time, an army under General Fronts. That offensive would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually, the gap between Sikorski's army and the "Strike Group" would close near the Cisek 2002, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0786412402&id=hNuGZOGk6UoC&pg=PA140&lpg=PA140&q=Rozwadowski&vq=Rozwadowski&dq=Rozwadowski&sig=Gzm5trogxhMjygu0qBKsACesExw pp. 140–141].</ref><ref name="Urb 346–441">Urbankowski 1997, vol. 1, pp. 346–441 and 357–358.</ref>

At the time, Piłsudski's plan was strongly criticized, and only the desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders to go along with it. Though based on reliable intelligence, including decrypted Soviet radio communications, the plan was termed "amateurish" by high-ranking army officers and military experts who were quick to point out Piłsudski's lack of formal military education.
