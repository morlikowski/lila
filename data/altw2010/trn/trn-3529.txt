Her roles varied from the cute looking teeny bopper who wore 
minis in Nomu (1974) to the battered wife of a
sadist husband in Idi Katha Kadu, to that of a comedienne who discovers 
that her husband wants to murder her for her wealth in "Money."  She performed showy roles in Telugu remakes of Hindi films, such as Yugandhar (1979) (the fighter role that Zeenat Aman originated in Don (1978 film)), Illalu (1981) (Reena Roy's dark-shaded role from Apnapan (1977)), etc.  In commercial cinema, she received a huge break when she starred in Adavi Ramudu (1977).  She also showed innovativeness and lack of vanity in original Telugu films like Premabhishekam (1981) where she played a supporting role as a deglamorized prostitute, while Sridevi played the female lead.<ref>http://www.telugucinema.com/tc/movies/premabhishekam_25yrs.php</ref> 

Although Telugu is her mother tongue language, she never learned to read or write Telugu, because she is from English and Tamil are taught in schools.  But that didn't stop her from starring in 225 Telugu films, and in one year, she had 24 film releases.  She accomplished all this, despite her illiteracy in Telugu, by having people read lines to her and she would remember and deliver her lines.<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/movies/2000/may/13jaya.htm rediff.com, Movies: The Jayasudha interview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Subhashini's daughter Pooja is now a budding actress.
