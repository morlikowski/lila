L''''Université McGill''' est une des universités les plus anciennes au Canada ; elle est considérée comme l'une des universités canadiennes les plus prestigieuses, et elle compte parmi les meilleures universités de l'Amérique du Nord、[http://media.www.mcgilltribune.com/media/storage/paper234/news/2003/04/01/McgillWeekly/Mcgill.Renamed.Harvard.Of.The.North-404471.shtml][http://athletics.mcgill.ca/alumni_news_details.ch2?article_id=1665][http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=49cc4d7f-e460-42a5-90eb-e40f5ac36ff0&k=17351], et celles du monde de tradition anglo-saxonne. Selon le ''Times Higher Education Supplement'', c'est la meilleure université canadienne, et elle est parmi les 12 meilleures du monde<ref>[http://www.geocities.jp/worldtheride/WorldRankings2007.pdf]''Times Higher Education Supplement'' (en 2006, elle occupait la 21 position), palmarès universitaire mondial, 2005, [http://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/38/05/times/]</ref>. Selon Research Infosource, c'est l'université de recherche de l'année au Canada et la meilleure dans la catégorie médicale/doctorale<ref> Research Infosource, 2005, [http://www.researchinfosource.com/pressroom/2005/20051025/01.shtml]</ref>.

En 2007, selon le Classement académique des universités mondiales elle est la 63éme université au monde (ce classement, en anglais ''Academic Ranking of World Universities'', est établi par des chercheurs de l'université Jiao Tong de Shanghai).

Elle est située dans la ville de Montréal, au Québec.
L'université possède deux campus, séparés par quelque 35 kilomètres : le campus principal est situé au centre-ville de Montréal (stations de métro McGill ou Peel), et le campus MacDonald dans la banlieue montréalaise de Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue. 

Elle est l'une des deux universités à Montréal offrant une instruction en langue anglaise, avec l'Université Concordia<ref>Ces deux universités sont, avec l'université hébraïque de Jérusalem, les héritières universelles du marchand de tableaux Max Stern, voir l'histoire d'un tableau de Franz Xaver Winterhalter.</ref>.

En 2005, l'université comptait  étudiants.

===Étudiants===
Les frais de scolarité pour les étudiants québécois et d'autres pays avec qui une entente a été signée (entre autres plusieurs pays de la Francophonie) sont limités par le gouvernement, qui en retour fournit la majeure partie du financement de l'université. La plupart des étudiants étrangers ne sont pas soumis à ces règles et payent des frais plus élevés sauf dans le cadre de partenariats (les frais de scolarité ne sont alors pas acquittés par l'étudiant). Les ententes particulières entre le gouvernement québécois et d'autres pays mènent à une situation où les étudiants d'autres provinces canadiennes doivent payer plus cher que plusieurs étudiants étrangers bénéficiant de bourses, situation régulièrement dénoncée par l'Association étudiante de l'Université McGill.

===Réseaux universitaires===
McGill est l'une des deux universités canadiennes à être membres du recherche.

Parmi les 5 meilleures au monde.

== Histoire ==
thumb|right|Statue de [[James McGill, l'hiver]]

L'université fut fondée en 1821 après un don de terrain et de  en argent de l'homme d'affaires James McGill (1744–1813), un riche marchand de fourrures voulant développer Montréal. Le « McGill College » dispense ses premiers cours en 1829 dans l'ancienne villa de campagne du marchand. Quatre ans plus tard, le nouvel établissement décerne un doctorat de médecine et de chirurgie à son premier diplômé, William Leslie Logie. En 1839, on agrandit en construisant la Faculté des arts grâce à des dons et au cours des décennies suivantes, la philanthropie continue de jouer un rôle clé dans l'évolution de l'Université McGill. Sir William Dawson, le recteur de 1855 à 1893, fait rayonner l'institution et les grands bienfaiteurs de l'époque, dont Lord Strathcona, Sir William Macdonald, William Molson et Peter Redpath, ouvrent leur goussets et on augmente le nombre de bâtiments à dix. En 1885, le Conseil des gouverneurs adopte officiellement l'appellation ''Université McGill''.

Lord Strathcona crée un fonds spécial destiné à l'éducation des femmes. Les premières étudiantes sont admises en 1884 et Carrie Derick, bachelière en Arts de 1890, devient la première femme professeure du Canada, enseignant la botanique à McGill. Au tournant du siècle du , des dons substantiels de Sir William Macdonald permettent à McGill de se doter d'un second campus, à Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, où on enseigne l'agronomie. Ses dons permettent de recruter des sommités comme Ernest Rutherford dont les recherches sur la nature de la radioactivité font connaître l'université internationalement. Il obtient un prix Nobel en 1908.

La réputation d'excellence de McGill croit avec le temps. Pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, de nombreux chercheurs britanniques et d'autres nationalités s'y retrouvent, contribuant à l'effort de guerre. Après le conflit, McGill continue à attirer professeurs et de plus en plus d'élèves. Le retour des soldats et le baby boom auront pour effet de tripler l'effectif étudiant. McGill devient une université publique et pour la première fois reçoit des subsides de l'état. De nouveaux édifices modernes sont construits à côté des vieux immeubles de pierre.

Les nationaliste québécois était d'avis qu'il était injuste que l'université québécoise la plus reconnue dans le monde n'offre ses cours qu'en anglais, alors qu'elle recevait la majeure partie de son budget du gouvernement québécois. Après de nombreuses démonstrations, le conseil de l'université dû se rendre à ces demandes. Les examens et travaux (''papers'') peuvent maintenant être rédigés en anglais ou en français si l'objectif du cours n'est pas d'apprendre une langue, bien que la majorité des cours soient toujours donnés en anglais. Certains cours sont donnés en français, par exemple ceux du Département de langue et littérature françaises. D'autre part, les étudiants en droit doivent comprendre le français car les cours portent autant sur le « Common Law » britanniques que le droit civil d'origine française et que les professeurs peuvent se servir de la langue de leur choix. Ces mesures ont eu pour effet d'augmenter l'enrôlement des francophones qui forment maintenant près de la moitié de la population étudiante.

Aujourd'hui, McGill est reconnue comme la principale université de recherche du Canada. Elle compte des gradués à travers le monde et fort pourcentage de ses étudiants viennent des quatre coins de la planète. En 2003, Mme Heather Munroe-Blum en est devenue le 16e recteur.

'''McGill University''' is a  public university located in oldest universities in Canada. The university bears the name of British colonial era, 46 years before Canadian Confederation, making McGill the first non-denominational university in the British Empire. Classes were first held in 1829. McGill University organizes public lecture series and begins classes for women in 1855. The university has evolved during its history, especially in the area of anglophone–francophone relations.

Total enrollment at McGill is over 30,000 students, 80% of whom are Canadian.  McGill has 21 faculties and medicine. Its language of instruction is English. McGill's commitment to research is highly regarded; the university has received awards for research activities and is a member of multiple research organizations.    McGill and its faculties are very highly ranked in many national, continental, and world-wide rankings.  Admissions criteria are very high and admissions are very competitive; less than 50% of applicants are admitted.

McGill's main Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, 30&nbsp;kilometres west of the downtown campus. Residence halls make up only a small portion of McGill's buildings, resulting in all non-freshmen being expected to find private, off-campus housing.  

Tuition varies widely based on a student's demographics, ranging from $3,500 to over $15,000 per year.  Scholarships and other financial aid are difficult to obtain, mainly due to the overall high level of academic achievement of the entire school population.  McGill has a high-quality student life; there are hundreds of student organizations, three newspapers, television and radio stations, and multiple student governments.  McGill participates in several collegiate athletic leagues, and has significant history in many sports.  

Alumni from McGill have been recognized in fields ranging from the arts and sciences, to business, politics, and sports. Notably, alumni include seven Nobel laureates, three astronauts, two Canadian prime ministers, seven Academy Award winners, and twenty-five Olympic medalists.

===Early years===
right|thumb|The Arts Building, built in 1839 and designed by [[John Ostell, is the oldest existing building on campus.]]

The university's first classes were held in 1829 at Burnside Place, James McGill's country home.<ref name= "Kip"/><ref>[http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/history.html "Brief history of Physics at McGill"], "McGill Physics", 2008. Accessed Sir John William Dawson, McGill's principal from 1855 to 1893, is often credited with transforming the school into a modern university.<ref>[http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/history/ McGill University Faculty of Medicine: History], "McGill University Faculty of Medicine", 2008. Accessed June 13, 2008.</ref>  He recruited the aid of Montreal's wealthiest citizens, many of whom donated property and funding needed to construct the campus buildings.  Their names adorn many of the campus's prominent buildings, including the Redpath Museum (1880), Macdonald Physics Building (1893), the Redpath Library (1893), the Macdonald Chemistry Building (1896), the Macdonald Engineering Building (1907), and the Strathcona Medical Building (1907)—since renamed the Strathcona Anatomy and Dentistry Building.  This expansion of the campus continued until 1920.  In 1885, the university's Board of Governors formally adopted the use of the name McGill University. The school of architecture at McGill University was founded in 1896.<ref>http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0009565</ref>

Women's education at McGill began in 1884, when Donald Smith, also known as Lord Strathcona, began funding separate lectures for women, given by university staff members.  The first degrees granted to women at McGill were conferred in 1888.<ref>[http://www.ccheritage.ca/biographies/williamdawson.php William Dawson], CCHeritage.</ref>  In 1899, the Royal Victoria College (RVC) opened as a residential college for women at McGill.  Until the 1970s, all female undergraduate students, known as "Donaldas," were considered to be members of RVC.<ref>[http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/public/hist_mcgill/rvc/rvc.htm Royal Victoria College], McGill University Archives.</ref>  Today, the College is an all-women's dormitory forming part of the university's residence system.
In 1900, the university established the MacLennan Travelling Library. In 1905, the university acquired a second campus when Sir William C. Macdonald, one of the university's major benefactors, endowed a college in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, 32 kilometres west of Montreal. Macdonald College, now known as the Macdonald Campus, opened to students in 1907, originally offering programs in agriculture, household science, and teaching.

McGill established the first post-secondary institutions in Victoria. It created Victoria College in 1903, a two-year college offering first and second-year McGill courses in arts and science, which was the predecessor institution to the modern University of Victoria. The province's first university was incorporated in Vancouver in 1908 as the McGill University College of British Columbia. The private institution granted McGill degrees until it became the independent University of British Columbia in 1915.<ref>[http://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/mucbc.html Higher Education in British Columbia Before the Establishment of UBC], UBC Archives.</ref>

===McGill français movement===
The 1960s represented an era of large nationalist and labour mobilizations in Quebec.  At the time, English was seen as the privileged language of commerce. McGill, where francophones comprised only three percent of the student population, was seen by some as a bastion of anglophone privilege in a predominantly French-speaking city.<ref>[http://www.reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3114/francais.html Reporter: McGill français]</ref><ref>[http://www.reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3111/scope.html Reporter: Kaleidoscope]</ref> There was only one French-language university in Montreal at the time: the Université de Montréal. McGill was largely out of reach to the 10,000 francophone graduates of the newly-created CEGEP system.  There was nowhere else local to continue their studies, and almost no other French-speaking universities in Canada.

The ''McGill français'' movement began in 1969, clamouring for a new McGill that would be francophone, pro-nationalist, and pro-worker.<ref>[http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3114/francais.html "McGill français and Quebec society"], "McGill Reporter", April 8, 1999. Accessed May 16, 2008.</ref> The movement was led by Stanley Gray, a political science professor from Ontario.  It was argued that, since McGill received the lion's share of government funding, paid by a taxpayer base that was largely francophone, the university should equally be accessible to that segment of the population.<ref>[http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r2902/daily.htm "A reunion of radicals"], "Reporter Volume 29 Number 2", September 26, 1996.

Accessed May 16, 2008.</ref> Gray led a demonstration of 10,000 trade unionists, leftist activists, CEGEP students, and even some McGill students, at the university's Roddick Gates on March 28, 1969.  Protesters shouted "McGill français", "McGill aux Québécois", and "McGill aux travailleurs" (McGill for workers).  However, the majority of students and faculty opposed such a position, and many of the protesters were arrested.<ref>Chester, Bronwyn.

Though McGill allowed students to write graduation thesis in French as early as 1835, McGill never became a francophone or officially English-language universities in Quebec; fluency in French is not a requirement to attend.  The Faculty of Law does, however, require all students to be "passively bilingual", meaning that all students must be able to read and understand spoken French—or English if the student is Francophone—since English or French may be used at any time in a course.  Since 1964, students in all faculties have been able to write exams and papers in either English or French, provided that the objective of the class is not to learn a particular language.<ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-0-10-1249-6929-10/index_souvenirs/vie_societe/mcgill_francais « McGill français! » - Souvenirs - Les Archives de Radio-Canada]</ref>

According to the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, "Researchers at McGill are affiliated with about 75 major research centres and networks, and are engaged in an extensive array of research partnerships with other universities, government and industry in Quebec and Canada, throughout North America and in dozens of other countries."<ref>[http://www.aucc.ca/can_uni/our_universities/mcgill_e.html "McGill University"], "Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada", April 4, 2008. Accessed May 26, 2008.</ref> Annually, around 100 inventions take place at McGill.<ref name="research07-08"></ref> In recognition of its research quality, McGill is affiliated with seven Nobel Laureates and professors have won major teaching prizes.

Since 1926, McGill has been a member of the G13, a group of prominent research universities within Canada.

McGill is perhaps best recognized for its research and discoveries in the health sciences. Donald Hebb, Brenda Milner, and others made significant discoveries in medicine, neuroscience and psychology while at McGill. The invention of the world's first artificial cell was made by an undergraduate student at the university. While chair of physics at McGill, nuclear physicist Ernest Rutherford performed the experiment that led to the discovery of the alpha particle and its function in radioactive decay, which won him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908. 

William Chalmers invented Archie, a pre-WWW search engine. A 3270 terminal emulator developed at McGill was commercialized and later sold to Hummingbird Software.

===Downtown campus===

McGill's main campus is situated in Peel and Aylmer streets. North of Docteur-Penfield, it also extends west of Peel for several blocks. As such, the campus is near the Peel and McGill metro stations.

The downtown campus reflects an eclectic mix of old and new buildings, reflecting the various periods in which the buildings were erected and a variety of architectural styles. All of the major university buildings were constructed using local grey limestone, which serves as a unifying element.<ref>"The use of local grey limestone as the main construction material is the unifying factor in all the campus structures."

====Accommodations====

Most McGill students do not live in residence (known colloquially as "rez") after their first year of study, even if they are not from the Montreal area. This is due to the fact that McGill's residence system is relatively small for a school of its size, housing approximately 2,400 undergraduate students and a handful of graduate students.<ref>[http://www.mcgill.ca/residences/ McGill Residences]</ref> With the exception of certain students returning as "floor fellows" or "dons", the majority of McGill residences are for first-year undergraduate students only. Senior students are expected to find off-campus housing.

Residences at McGill come in a variety of forms. Many first-years live in the Bishop Mountain Residences (known to most students as "Upper Rez"),<ref>" Upper Rez: Douglas, McConnell, Molson and Gardner Halls". [http://www.mcgill.ca/residences/undergraduate/admissions/movein/#UPPER "Moving into Residences"], "McGill University", 2008. Accessed McConnell Hall, Molson Hall, Gardner Hall, and Douglas Hall. While the other three dormitories were constructed during the 1960s, Douglas Hall, which opened in 1937, is distinguished by its impressive stone facade and wood interiors. McConnell, Molson, and Gardner Halls share a cafeteria, located at the centre of the three dormitories, known as Bishop Mountain Hall.

Burnside Hall, the tower in the background, houses a number of science departments.]]

''Royal Victoria College'', the second-largest residence at McGill, is a women's only dormitory. McGill's newest residence, aptly named ''New Residence Hall'' (known simply as "New Rez") is a converted four-star hotel located a few blocks east of campus. New Rez is the largest of the university's dormitories. ''Solin Hall'', an apartment-style residence four metro stops from campus is situated in a converted chocolate factory. 

The McGill Off-Campus Residence Experience (MORE) residences consist of a series of converted apartment buildings and houses, the largest of which is The Greenbriar, an apartment-style residence located across from the Milton Gates.

The university's athletic facilities, including Molson Stadium, are located on Mount Royal, near the residence halls and the Montreal Neurological Institute. The Gymnasium is named in honour of General Sir Arthur William Currie. 

Most second-year students transition to off-campus apartment housing, and apartment hunting is sometimes seen as a "rite of passage" for McGill students. In recent years, finding affordable housing has been challenging because of the city's tight housing market, particularly in neighbourhoods close to the McGill campus.<ref>[http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3201/ghetto.html "In the Ghetto"], "McGill Reporter", September 9, 1999. Accessed June 5, 2008.</ref> Many students end up living in the "McGill Ghetto," the neighbourhood directly to the east of the downtown campus. The word "ghetto" is not, in this case, used in a derogatory manner - it is used with the true meaning of the word: a socioeconomically homogeneous area.<ref>[http://www.montrealbits.com/plateau_mont_royal/mcgill_ghetto/ "McGill Ghetto"], "Montreal Bits", April 14, 2008. Accessed June 5, 2008.</ref> In recent years though, students have begun moving out to other areas because of rising rent prices in the locale.
