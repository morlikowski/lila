== History ==
Brisbane Boys' College was established in 1902 by Mr Arthur Rudd. Rudd arrived in Brisbane in 1901 by boat from Clayfield. The school officially started in March 1902 with just three students.  

In 1912, the school moved to a new premises on the corner of Bayview Terrace, near the tram terminus, for a need of more room. There was limited room for sporting, so for many years the boys walked to the nearby Kalinga Park. In 1908, there were 80 men, and a cadet corps was formed with the impending 1914-1918 war. The school suffered the losses of eight Clayfield Collegians during the war. In the late twenties it was decided that there were insufficient facilities, and for the school was moved to its current site in Toowong with support from its owners, the daughters of the late Premier of Queensland, Sir Robert Philp. The Clayfield campus became a primary school department of Somerville House, which later developed into the independent Clayfield College.

Today BBC is owned by the Presbyterian and Methodist Schools Association, which was formed in 1918, and owns other private schools in Queensland.<ref name=PMSA/>

thumb|right|180px|Brisbane Boys' College front entrance
BBC's Toowong on land bordered by Moggill Road, Kensington Terrace and Miskin Street, with the main entrance from Kensington Terrace.

The main building dates from the 1930s, when the school moved to the site, and is characterised by its Mediterranean arches and clock tower. The Rudd and Hamilton wings form a T-shape, extending away from the main building, and the modern glass fronted library fills the quadrant. Other buildings on the site include McKenzie wing, College Hall, Barbra Helen Thomson Sports Complex, Birtles wing and the Junior School buildings.

The new Junior School Buildings were completed in early 2008, which houses the newly introduced Prep - Grade 3 students as well as the Grade 4 and 5 students. There are three ovals included within the BBC grounds: Main, P&F and Miskin. BBC also makes use of the Oakman Park ovals, Toowong College, University of Queensland and St Lucia playing fields.

== Uniform ==
The College uniform varies throughout the different grades, these being between Years 1&ndash;6, 7&ndash;11 and 12. One defining factor of the uniform is the boater, a straw hat worn to and from the school and in public that has been a college tradition since its conception. In Years 4&ndash;6, the uniform consists of a green shirt, a green and black tie, grey shorts and plain grey socks. In Years 7&ndash;11, the only difference is that trousers are worn, and in Year 12 a white shirt and green and white tie are worn.right|250px 

Green, white and black striped blazers are worn in terms 2 and 3. Blazers also display "Colours" which are awards that warrant embroidery on the pockets of the blazer. Lines, Half-Colours and Full-Colours are displayed on the bottom right-hand, top left-hand and top right-hand pocket respectively, and each display a line of text, which display the category of achievement and the year the award was given. Half-Colours and Full-Colours also exhibit altered forms of the BBC emblem (School captains have a yellow full colour emblem).
Students in leadership positions, such as house captains and prefects, are given a badge with their name and position within the school. Prefects wear a yellow tie and boater-band, which features Green, Black and Gold stripes.

Das '''Brisbane Boys’ College''' (BBC), gegründet 1902, ist eine reine Jungenschule mit integriertem Internat in Brisbane, Queensland, Australien. 

== Geschichte ==
Brisbane Boys’ College wurde 1902 von Arthur "Barney" Rudd gegründet. Rudd erreichte Brisbane im Jahre 1901 per Schiff von Clayfield in einem Haus mit dem Namen "Knockarda" zu gründen. Nach Öffnung im Februar 1902 hatte die Schule nur vier Schüler. 

Im Jahre 1906 zog die Schule auf ein neues Grundstück an der Ecke von Bayview Terrace nahe der Tram-Station um. Da es dort nur begrenzt Platz für Sportplätze gab, mussten die Schüler mehrere Jahre lang stets zum nahe gelegenen Kalinga Park laufen, um dort Sport zu treiben. 1908 hatte die Schule 32 Schüler und gründete eine Kadetteneinheit aufgrund des bevorstehenden 1. Weltkriegs. Die Schule verlor acht Clayfield-Schüler während dieses Krieges. In den späten Zwanzigern entschied man sich aufgrund der begrenzten Kapazitäten erneut umzuziehen: Die Schule zog an ihren heutigen Sitz in Toowong mit großzügiger Unterstützung ihrer Besitzer, die Töchter des späteren Premierministers von Queensland, Sir Robert Philp. Der alte Clayfield-Campus wurde zur Grundschule des Somerville House, welche sich später zum unabhängigen Clayfield College weiterentwickelte.

== Heute ==
Brisbane Boys’ College ist als eine der besten Schulen Brisbanes bekannt. Es ist Eigentum der Presbyterian and Methodist Schools' Association, die 1929 gegründet wurde und noch weitere Privatschulen in Queensland besitzt.

Obwohl die Schule einen starken Glauben in den akademischen Erfolg pflegt, gibt es viele außerschulische Aktivitäten, die den Schülern der Jahrgänge 4 bis 12 angeboten werden. Die Schulleitung glaubt fest an die Lehren der Disziplin und des Sportgeists. Die Schule gewann den ersten je stattfindenden GPS "head of the river" Ruder-Wettbewerb.
