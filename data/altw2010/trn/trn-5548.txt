'''Hannah''', also known as '''Hannah Ild''', is an Estonian singer. She was born on May 12, 1981, in Tallinn, Estonia. Hannah is an extraordinarily gifted songwriter, singer and pianist, whose unique blend of ballads and classic pop has dominated the charts in her home country for more than a decade.
Her passion for music began at an early age. She began singing even before she could speak. When she was three years old, she joined the Children Music Studio. From there she went on to join the Estonian Radio Singing Studio. When she was seven, Hannah joined the elite Estonian Television Music Choir. At the same time she also began to attend the Tallinn Music School. Here she realized her true musical talent, at the piano. 
By the time Hannah was thirteen she had produced her first song called Childhood land – composing lyrics and music together – which won first place in the Estonian Children’s Song Competition in 1995. This naturally gave Hannah great encouragement and self confidence leading her to produce further song entirely of her own creation.

In 1997, Hannah left the TV Choir and began her solo career. Almost immediately she swept to fame by coming second place both in the Estonian Eurovision Song Contest and the Estonian National Singing Competition. Importantly Hannah performed her own song in the Eurovision Contest – “Lonely Soul”. 
She has won three Golden Records "Best Female Artist In Estonia" (2003-2004) and "Best Album of the Year" (2004) She has been nominated for several other awards as well, including "Best Song of the Year"

She has been nominated for six years in different categories winning many awards including “Best Song of the Year” (2003 with “Secretly”).

Hannah has been consistently in the Estonian top ten since 1997 and has an enormous fan club.

== Education ==
She studied media and advertising at Tallinn University (Media and Advertising) and enjoys events organization.

She is Lady of the Castle of Neeruti, which she is restoring with her family.
Hannah is aware of her own talent and of its potential. She is not interested in “fame for fames sake” which she realizes usually leads to short lived celebrity soon to fade into oblivion.

== Hannah's talent and her music ==

Hannah’s talents (combined) are the very essence of her life and she wishes to develop them sensitively and professionally and to share them with the whole world.

Her style is unique and this she wishes to evolve and preserve allowing the public to appreciate her combination of lyric writing, music composing and performance.

Her aim is to develop and promote her music in a spirit of excellence whilst, although being a well known public figure, retaining the essential privacy of her person. Fame and private life combined!

This aim requires a very professional and disciplined approach witch she expects both of herself and of her team.

== Charity ==
