In January 1,600 km) away. The only aircraft that could quickly deliver the medicine was taken out of winter storage, but its engine was frozen and would not start; after considering alternatives, officials decided to move the medicine by Nenana, where the first musher embarked as part of a relay aimed at delivering the needed serum to Nome. More than 20 mushers took part, facing a °F temperatures and strong winds. News coverage of the race was worldwide.

On Norwegian Togo. They came from Nome towards the end of the run and picked up the serum from musher Henry Ivanoff. The serum was later passed to Kaasen.  

Kaasen did not consider Balto a particularly good lead dog, but Balto proved himself on the Iditarod trail, saving his team from certain death in the Topkok River. Balto was also able to stay on the trail in near whiteout conditions in which Kaasen admitted he could barely see his hand in front of his face. During a blizzard, Kaasen and his team missed the last sled dog team and had to take the medicine twice as far, which was what eventually brought them to fame. 

Togo was the star dog for Leonhard Seppala even before the great 1925 Serum Run. Instead of celebrating the triumph together as one huge team, many became jealous of the publicity Balto received, especially from President Coolidge and the press. The elite and Seppala favored Togo, the general public loved the story behind Balto, but they would take a far different path after the celebrations were over. Balto was not welcomed at the ceremony in New York in which Seppala and Togo received awards from the explorer Roald Amundsen.

After the mission's success, Balto and Kaasen became celebrities.

Balto was not destined to be a star in the breeding shed since he was neutered at a young age, hence he was relegated to being neglected on the vaudeville circuit with his team.  While visiting Los Angeles, former prize fighter turned businessman George Kimble, from Cleveland was shocked to discover the dogs were unhealthy and badly treated.

Mr. Kimble worked together with the newspaper, the Cleveland Plain Dealer,to bring Balto and his team to Cleveland, Ohio.  On March 19, 1927, Balto and six companions were brought to Cleveland and given a hero's welcome in a triumphant parade. The dogs were then taken to the Brookside Zoo (now the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo).

After Balto's death in 1933, he was taxidermied, mounted, and donated to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.<ref name=ClevelandHistory></ref>  In 1998 the Alaska Legislature passed HJR 62- 'Bring Back Balto' resolution.  The Cleveland Museum of Natural History declined to return Balto; however, in October 1998, Balto left for a five-month stay at the Anchorage Museum of History and Art which drew record crowds.

'''Balto''' (vers Nome (anti-diphtérique dut être transporté de Anchorage à Nome par traîneaux de chiens pour combattre une épidémie de cette maladie.

Au début de l'année 1925, la diphtérie, maladie mortelle qui attaque les enfants, se développe à Nome. Du sérum est demandé en urgence à tous les hôpitaux des alentours. Par télégramme, les autorités apprennent qu'il en reste dans la ville d'Anchorage, à 1600 kilomètres de là. Le blizzard qui souffle en violentes rafales empêche l'acheminement par avion. Il est décidé qu'un train pourra transporter le sérum jusqu'à la ville de Nenana, mais pas plus loin, faute de chemin de fer. Or, Nenana se trouve encore à plus de mille kilomètres de Nome. Une seule solution s'offre aux habitants : faire l'aller-retour en traîneau grâce à un attelage tiré par des chiens.

C'est ainsi qu'une vingtaine d'équipages prennent le départ depuis Nome et affrontent le froid, le vent et la neige. Beaucoup déclarent forfait en chemin. Le premier arrivé à Nenana est un certain Gunnar Kassen, dont l'équipe de huskys est dirigée par Balto. Mais sur le chemin du retour, l'homme, paralysé par la chute des températures, est incapable de continuer à guider son équipage.

Alors que Gunnar Kassen a perdu tout espoir de sauver les enfants de Nome, Balto, qui se souvient du trajet, se met à conduire le traîneau, et ramène à toute vitesse son équipe, ainsi que le précieux chargement, à bon port. De retour dans leur village, les chiens sont trop épuisés pour pouvoir encore aboyer, mais au moins, le sérum peut être administré aux malades.
