The '''Aston Martin DBR1''' was a sports racing car built by Aston Martin starting in 1956, intended for the World Sportscar Championship as well as non-championship sportscar races at the time.  It is most famous as the victor of the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans, the only win to date for Aston Martin at the endurance classic.

==Design==
Following changes to the rules for sportscar racing, entrants no longer had to use cars which were road legal, or based on road legal cars, such as the Aston Martin DB3S.  Therefore, with the ability to create a sportscar from a clean slate for 1956, Aston Martin created the DBR1, with Ted Cutting as chief designer.<ref name="Ted1">{{cite web

Instead, the DBR1 featured full bodywork with a large triangular vent on the side, a design trait which would become standard on all future Aston Martins.

The DBR1 was initially fitted with a smaller 2.6L (2580 cc) Lagonda Straight-6 engine derived from the Aston Martin DB2 production car, even though the DBR1's predecessor, the DB3S, was at the time racing with a larger 2.9L (2922 cc) engine.  Later DBR1s would feature the DBB-spec 2.9L Straight-6, rated at .

==Racing history==
===1956===
Debuting at the David Brown's Aston Martin racing team set out with the 2.6L DBR1/1 alongside two older 2.9L DB3Ss.  Although performing well through most of the race, the DBR1 suffered gearbox failure after 246 laps, forcing drivers Reg Parnell and Tony Brooks to retire.

===1957===
Making a full debut in the Spa Sportscar Race, Aston Martin took the top two spots, with Tony Brooks winning over Roy Salvadori.  At the fourth round of the World Sportscar Championship, the 1000km Nürburgring, DBR1/2 took an overall victory at the hands of Tony Brooks and Noël Cunningham-Reid, earning Aston Martin its own championship points that season.  Roy Salvadori and Les Leston would finish 6th in the same race.  Unfortunately, at the 1957 24 Hours of Le Mans, both DBR1s failed to finish.  DBR1/2 would take the only other victory of the season at the non-championship Spa Grand Prix.

===1958===

For 1958, DBR1/3 was completed and began to compete.  David Brown chose to concentrate on the World Sportscar Championship exclusively, leaving the DBR2 for non-championship races.  The team did not enter the opening round in Buenos Aires, choosing instead to race at the following round, the Tourist Trophy, Aston Martin managed a 1-2-3 finish for all cars, with Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks driving the winning car.  This dominating victory allowed Aston Martin to finish 2nd in the constructor's championship behind Ferrari.

===1959===
Returning again for 1959, Aston Martin had completed two more chassis, DBR1/4 and DBR1/5.  The first car was actually a conversion from a DBR3, while DBR1/5 was a spare chassis sold to privateer Graham Whitehead, the only car to do so.  With four chassis, Aston Martin would again concentrate on the World Sportscar Championship.  The season started slowly, with a sole DBR1 failing to finish at the 12 Hours of Sebring, then followed by the team not appearing at the Targa Florio.  Luck returned again for Aston Martin, as the sole factory entry again won the 1000km Nürburgring, with Stirling Moss and Jack Fairman driving.  However, Aston Martin's success would continue with what is considered their finest motorsports triumph.  DBR1/2, driven by Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori, took victory at the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans.  DBR1/4, driven by Maurice Trintignant and Paul Frére, managed second.  The next closest competitor was a distant 25 laps behind the duo.  

With the constructors championship now closely contested by Goodwood.  Aston Martin entered three DBR1s, as well as privateer Graham Whitehead's DBR1/5.  During the race, DBR1/3 caught fire in the pits, destroying the car and leaving Aston Martin without room to refuel their other cars.  To salvage Aston Martin's hopes of a championship, Graham Whitehead withdrew his entry from the race in order to allow Aston Martin to use his pits stall and finish the race.  Able to continue, Stirling Moss,  Carroll Shelby and Jack Fairman in DBR1/2 were able to secure victory and the championship over Ferrari, the only World Championship won by Aston Martin.

===Privateers===
Following Aston Martin's success in 1959, David Brown decided to make an unsuccessful move to DBR4 and DBR5.  Thus the factory's David Brown Racing Department would no longer compete in sportscars, leaving the four DBR1s retained by the factory, including the rebuilt DBR1/3, were sold off to customers for use in various championships.  DBR1/2 would be the only car to score a win in privateer hands, winning the 1960 Rouen Grand Prix.  Following the 1962 season, all DBR1s would retire from racing and eventually end up in museums or private collections.

'''Aston Martin DBR''' är en brittiska biltillverkaren Aston Martin mellan 1956 och 1959.

==Bakgrund==
Till  genomförde sportvagnarna än mer från produktionsvagnarna. Aston Martin började därför utveckla en efterträdare till DB3:an.

Astons ägare David Brown hade bara ett mål med bilen: att vinna Le Mans 24-timmars. DB3:an hade producerats och sålts även till privatförare, men med den nya bilen satsades alla resurser på fabriksstallet.

==DBR1==
W O Bentley-konstruktion som satt i företrädaren, men bilen fick ett helt nytt chassi. Förutom att det var starkare än tidigare, var det även lättare.

Till  satsade Aston Martin på den större DBR2, men sedan FIA infört en begränsning av motorstorleken i sportvagns-VM till tre liter, blev DBR1:an åter fabrikens huvudmodell.

==DBR2== 
För att kunna konkurrera med de större Jaguar-, Ferrari- och Maserati-modellerna, utvecklade Aston Martin DBR2-modellen. Bilen blev en större version av DBR1:an.

Bilen fick en ny motor, konstruerad av Tadek Marek, samma motor som introducerades i DB4:an ett år senare. Chassit var också större, men byggt efter samma principer som DBR1:an.

Aston Martin använde DBR2:an i sportvagnsmästerskapet under . Till säsongen  ändrade FIA reglerna och bilen uteslöts ur VM. Aston fortsatte då att tävla med bilen i lopp utanför VM-serien.

==DBR3==
DBR3 är i princip en DBR1 med en kortslagig version av Tadek Mareks motor, för att klara DBR4. Aston byggde ett exemplar, som tävlade på Silverstone . Provet föll inte väl ut och bilen byggdes om till DBR1-specifikation.
