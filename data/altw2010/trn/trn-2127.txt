== History==
===Beginnings and ''Half Hour of Power'' (1996-2000)===
The members of Sum 41 started out in rival bands in high school. They came up with their name after they met while attending a Hole concert 41 days into the summer of 1996. The Band was originally a Supernova show on September 28, 1996.They were scouted by Cone, joined the band in 1999, after the band went through several other bassists. Cone claims the reason they were signed was that he had joined their band.
In Rock Out with Your Cock Out''. These demo tapes are extremely rare and are the only recordings known with the original bassist Richard "Twitch" Roy, a copy of the tape has recently sold for $45 on Ebay.

The band carried a video camera with them to film their crazy antics including robbing a pizza place with water guns and performing a dance to "Makes No Difference" in front of a theater (both of which can be seen on both ''Introduction to Destruction'' and on some versions of the bonus DVD, called ''Cross Your T's and Gouge Your I's'' from ''Does This Look Infected?'').

The band submitted the video footage along with their demo tapes to several record labels. Island Records, wanting to capitalize on the pop punk fad popularized by Green Day and Blink-182, signed Sum 41 in early 2000. The band decided to stay with Aquarius Records in Canada, as they were "the first label to show an interest in us and they got us our first Warped Tour dates, so we wanted to stay with them." <ref>"Sum 41 Unleash Their Power." Canadian Musician July-Aug. 2000: 15. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. University of Illinois. 18 Feb. 2008.</ref>

Sum 41 released the EP ''Half Hour of Power'' on June 27, 2000. The first single released by the band was "Makes No Difference", which had two different videos. The first video was put together using the video clips (such as the band robbing a pizza place) sent to the record label and the second showed the band performing at a house party.

===''All Killer No Filler'' and ''Does This Look Infected?'' (2001-2003) ===         

Sum 41's first full-length album, ''All Killer No Filler'', was released on May 8, 2001. The first single released was "Fat Lip", which became a huge hit during the summer, becoming the #1 rock song in the U.S. as well as many other countries around the world.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&model.vnuArtistId=401778&model.vnuAlbumId=476041 Billboard.com - Artist Chart History - Sum 41<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Performances on the Warped Tour during the year further increased the popularity of the band. 

Two other singles were released. They were "In Too Deep", which had a comedy video of the band in a diving competition, and "Motivation", a simplistic video of the band playing in a classic garage band theme. The band toured for much of the year, playing 300 shows in 2001, including opening for Blink-182 on tour before returning to the studio to record another CD.<ref>http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12061085</ref>

On Still Waiting", the video of which had them mocking "new-garage" retro-rock under the name of "The Sums" and was a parody of one of The Strokes' videos. 

The band followed up the release of "Still Waiting", with "The Hell Song", a unique video of which had the band using dolls with their pictures on them and others, such as Ozzy Osbourne and Pamela Anderson. Their next single,"Over My Head (Better Off Dead)", had a video released exclusively in Canada and on their website, featuring live shots of the band. The video was also on their live DVD, ''Sake Bombs And Happy Endings'' (2003), as a bonus feature. It has also received limited airing on various music television stations in the USA and UK.      

After extensive touring in support of the album, Iggy Pop recruited Sum 41 for his new album, ''Skull Ring''. Deryck co-wrote the first single from the album, "Little Know It All", and joined Iggy on ''The Late Show with David Letterman'' to promote the song. Iggy said he chose Sum 41 "because they have balls."

===''Chuck'' and the Congo (2004-2006)===
In early 2004, the band contributed to the first ''Moron", which was also a bonus track in the Japanese import of ''Chuck''.

  

In late May of 2004, the band travelled to the War Child Canada, a branch of the British charity organization, to document the civil war occurring in the country.<ref name="MTV">[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1485897/03222004/sum_41.jhtml Sum 41 Plan Trip To War-Torn Congo - News Story | Music, Celebrity, Artist News | MTV News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Days after arriving, fighting broke out near the hotel the band was staying at in  Music, Celebrity, Artist News | MTV News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The band waited for the firing to die down, but it never did. A U.N. peacekeeper, Charles "Chuck" Pelletier (also Canadian), called for armored carriers to take the hotel's occupants out of the hot zone. After nearly six hours, the carriers arrived, and the band and the forty other civilians were taken to safety. The band named their next album ''Chuck'' in honor of Pelletier for taking them to safety. The documentary was made into a film called ''ROCKED: Sum 41 in Congo'', and was later aired on [[MTV. War Child released it on DVD on November 29, 2005, in the United States and Canada.

Sum 41's album, ''Chuck'', was released on Pieces", a relatively soft song which reached the top of the charts in Canada, and "Some Say", released as a single only in Canada and Japan. The last single off the record was "No Reason", released at the same time as "Some Say", but with no video and only in Europe and the USA, where it reached #16 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts.

Sum 41 released a live CD, ''Happy Live Surprise'', in Japan on Aquarius Records instead of EMI, the band's former label in Canada. (The band had an issue with their producer and their management company, Greig Nori and Bunk Rock Music; since their management company had a contract with EMI, after the band left the company and dropped the producer, the contract was broken.) The Japanese version contained a CD with five songs from their live performance. It was originally to be a DVD, but the band was unhappy with the way the filming turned out and decided to put out a live CD instead. The footage is being incorporated into a project along with the rest of the film from the tour.

Following their September 11, 2005 show in Quebec City, Quebec, the band went on a touring hiatus, although on April 17, 2006, Sum 41 played at a tribute to Iggy Pop, joining Iggy on stage for "Little Know It All" and "Lust For Life".

===Side projects, Dave's departure, and  ''Underclass Hero'' (2006 - Present)===

On, May 11, 2006, Dave Baksh announced in a statement through his management company that he was leaving Sum 41 to work with his new band, Brown Brigade. Baksh's departure from the band was said to have been due to his desire to play music with a more classical metal sound.<ref name="chartattack">[http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2006/05/1111.cfm Brownsound Quits Sum 41<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="MTV news 3">[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1531654/05122006/sum_41.jhtml Sum 41 Guitarist Quits To Focus On New Band - News Story | Music, Celebrity, Artist News | MTV News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He is the lead guitarist in Brown Brigade.

On May 12, Deryck made the first official comment on the subject on the official message board post addressing Dave's departure.<ref name="official website 2">[http://www6.islandrecords.com/sum41/www2/bbs/bbs1_7/thread.php?site_num=11&thread_num=14386018&folder_num=23&id=443188337988 http://www6.islandrecords.com/sum41/www2/bbs/bbs1_7/...read_num=14386018&folder_num=23&id=443188337988]</ref> Deryck confirmed Dave's departure and announced that the band would only be replacing Dave with a touring guitarist, who wouldn't be in videos, photo shoots, albums, or have any decision-making power in the band.

During the band's touring hiatus, Deryck focused on his producing career, writing and producing two songs for H<sub>2</sub>O and Juliette and the Licks. The two-person band, named The Operation M.D., released their debut album, ''We Have an Emergency'', in early 2007. As well as playing bass, keyboards, and acoustic guitar, Cone contributed backing vocals as well as leading vocals on three songs.<ref name="the operation myspace">[http://www.myspace.com/theoperationmusic MySpace.com - THE OPERATION M.D. - LOS ANGELES/TORONTO, CA - Rock / Garage / Alternative - www.myspace.com/theoperationmusic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. The Operation album was co-produced and mixed by Deryck Whibley. Their first single video, "Sayonara", was directed by Stevo.

On April 17, 2007, the band released a song on iTunes called "March of the Dogs". Although not a single, the band released it early because, according to Deryck, "the record won't be out until the summer."

O '''Sum 41''' se formou em 1996, em Ajax, Ontario, CanadÃ¡, pelos adolescentes Deryck Whibley e Steve Jocz. Cone McCaslin foi recrutado um pouco mais tarde para completar a banda. O grupo apostava numa mistura bem humorada de punk e pop.
==HistÃ³ria==
O nome da banda, '''Sum 41''', Ã© uma abreviaÃ§Ã£o da expressÃ£o: "''41 days into the Summer''", ou seja, 41 dias de verÃ£o. Mas nem mesmo os componentes sabem o porquÃª da escolha. Talvez porque o nome soa bem e Ã© original. O quarteto criado em cena local com artimanhas brincalhonas e performances altamente energÃ©ticas, logo passou a realizar shows em regiÃµes vizinhas. VÃ¡rios produtores interessaram-se pela banda. Inicialmente, assinaram um contrato com a gravadora ''Aquarius'', no CanadÃ¡, mas optou pela Island Records, que viu no Sum 41 um forte concorrente para os americanos do The Bloodhound e Blink-182.

Em Half Hour of Power'', e Ã© iniciada sua divulgaÃ§Ã£o com a turnÃª ''Warped Two''. ''All Killer No Filler'', lanÃ§ado em marÃ§o de 2002, ganhou esse nome por ser uma provocaÃ§Ã£o Ã  artistas que conseguiam sucesso com apenas uma mÃºsica, e logo depois desapareciam da mÃ­dia. Nesse perÃ­odo, produtores como Jerry Finnbad Fin (que trabalhou com bandas como Green Day e Blink 182) e Jose MacGrath passaram a ajudar no trabalho dos caras. ''Fat Lip'' alcanÃ§ou a maior audiÃªncia nas rÃ¡dios, mas ''In Too Deep'' tambÃ©m nÃ£o ficava pra traz. 

No Osbournes - fizeram a banda cumprir mais de 200 shows atÃ© o lanÃ§amento do prÃ³ximo cd.

O ano de 2004 foi um ano muito produtivo pra banda, fizeram muitas parcerias e participaram da campanha canadense ''War Child Canada''. Em visita Ã  RepÃºblica DemocrÃ¡tica do Congo, a banda foi salva das conseqÃ¼encias de guerra por Chuck Pelletier, um voluntÃ¡rio das NaÃ§Ãµes Unidas. Em sua homenagem, o novo Ã¡lbum seria intitulado ''Chuck''. O novo cd mostrou o amadurecimento da banda com riffs tÃ£o perigosos como esvaziar urÃ¢nio e armadilhas tÃ£o capturÃ¡veis quanto partÃ­culas radioativas. MÃºsicas como ''Some Say'' e ''Pieces'' mostram que a banda estÃ¡ aberta a mudanÃ§as. Este Ã© o Ãºnico cd composto inteiramente de material inÃ©dito. Um cd bem trabalhado e aceito pelo pÃºblico, tanto Ã© que, com menos de seis meses de circulaÃ§Ã£o, o cd chegou a ser um disco de ouro nos Estados Unidos.

O ano de 2005 prometia Ã  banda uma consagraÃ§Ã£o mundial. A banda recebeu o prÃªmio de ''Melhor disco de Rock do Ano'' no ''Juno awards''. Em 29 de Outubro, a ''Island Records'' divulga que a banda acabara de conquistar o disco de platina duplo no CanadÃ¡, ou seja, 400 mil cÃ³pias vendidas. Em 2005, a banda foi parar no cinema, com o filme ''Dirty Love''.

ApÃ³s a intensa turnÃª do cd ''Chuck'', eles divulgam irÃ£o ficar parados atÃ© 2007, apenas descansando, notÃ­cia recebida com apreensÃ£o pelos fÃ£s. No mesmo ano, foi lanÃ§ado um cd ao vivo gravado em um show feito no JapÃ£o. Entitulado ''Happy Live Surprise'' ainda nÃ£o tem data de lanÃ§amento aqui para o Brasil, e mais inÃºmeras coletÃ¢neas e tributos que a banda foi convidada a fazer, como a ''Killer Queen'', um tributo Ã  banda ''Queen''.

Atualmente, a banda estÃ¡ sem um guitarrista. Durante as fÃ©rias da banda, o guitarrista Dave Baksh (Brownsound) formou uma banda de heavy metal, chamada Brown Brigade. A banda ainda nÃ£o comunicou a entrada de algum novo guitarrista. HÃ¡ rumores de que Dave Baksh saiu da banda por nÃ£o concordar com o tipo de som que iriam fazer no novo cd.

Os Sum 41 lanÃ§ou de um novo cd de originais intitulado "Underclass Hero". O lanÃ§amento ocorreu no dia 24 de Julho de 2007. Mesmo perdendo um pouco da agressividade e o toque de heavy metal,(uma das caracteristicas mais marcantes da banda) com a saida de Dave, o novo CD estÃ¡ indo muito bem.
