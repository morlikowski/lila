}}The '''de Havilland DH.110 Sea Vixen''' was a 1950s-1960s British two-seat jet fighter of the Fleet Air Arm (the air component of the Royal Navy) designed by the de Havilland. Developed from an earlier first generation jet fighter, the Sea Vixen was a capable carrier-based fleet defence fighter that served into the 1970s.

==Development==
The aircraft was originally known as the ''DH.110''; an aircraft designed for both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Fleet Air Arm as an all-weather, missile-armed, high-speed jet fighter. The Admiralty had published a requirement for a fleet defence fighter to replace the de Havilland Sea Venom. However, the RAF chose the Gloster Javelin, a rival to the DH.110, after deciding the Javelin was a cheaper and simpler aircraft. Despite this, de Havilland continued with the project, and by the late 1950s, the Royal Navy had placed an order and the aircraft entered service with the Fleet Air Arm. 

The prototype took to the skies on 1952. Following a demonstration of the aircraft's ability to break the main spar, which resulted in the outer ends of the wings shearing off on execution of a high-rate turn. The subsequent shift in the DH.110's centre of gravity caused the aircraft to lurch violently, creating forces of over 12g, resulting in the cockpit and tail sections breaking away and the engines being torn from the airframe. One engine landed safely in an unoccupied car park. However, the second engine ploughed into a crowded spectator area at the end of the runway, causing the majority of casualties. Others were injured by debris from the cockpit landing close to the main spectator enclosures alongside the runway. This incident led to a major restructuring of the safety regulations for air shows in the UK, and since this accident no member of the public has died as a result of an air show accident in the UK.

Due to this incident, modifications were made to the other prototype  In 1955, a further ''DH.110'' was produced, a semi-navalised variant including change of leading edge profile and strengthening of wing (no folding wings), as a prototype for the production version, with it making its first flight that same year. The following year, the aircraft made its first arrested deck landing on the fleet aircraft carrier HMS ''Ark Royal''. In 1957, the first true Sea Vixen, the '''Sea Vixen FAW.20''' (fighter all-weather), flew. It was later redesignated the '''FAW.1'''. In July 1959, the first of over a hundred FAW 1s entered service with the Fleet Air Arm.

==Design==
The Sea Vixen had a de Havilland Sea Vampire'' and ''de Havilland Sea Venom''. The Sea Vixen became the first British aircraft to be solely armed with missiles, rockets and bombs. The Sea Vixen FAW.1 was armed with four de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missiles, two Microcell unguided 2-inch (51 mm) rocket packs and had a capacity for four 500 lb (230 kg) bombs or two 1,000 lb bombs. It was powered by two 50.0 kN (11,230 lbf) thrust Rolls-Royce Avon 208 turbojet engines; had a speed of 690 mph (1,110 km/h) and a range of 600 miles (1,000 km). 

The original DH.110 design (as offered to the RAF) ''did'' have the fitting of cannons in its prospectus. Experiments with ADEN cannons were carried out and it was found that their firing caused failure of the mountings due to the force of the recoil. The solution was to put a baulk (reinforcing piece) of timber in place to absorb the recoil force. Thus the Vixen was also the last British fighter to use wood in its construction. The cannons were soon removed and an all-missile armament was developed.

The pilot's canopy is offset to the left hand side. The other crew member (the navigator) was housed to the right completely within the fuselage, gaining access through a flush-fitting top hatch into his space (known in the service as the "coal hole") which had a small window.

The '''Sea Vixen FAW.2''' was the successor to the FAW.1 and included many improvements. As well as Firestreak missiles, it could carry the Red Top AAM, four Bullpup missile. An enlarged tail boom allowed for additional fuel tanks in the "pinion" extensions above and before the wing leading edge, and there was an improved escape system along with additional room for more electronic counter-measures equipment. However, the changes in aerodynamics meant that the 1,000 lb bomb was no longer able to be carried. Visually the FAW.1 and FAW.2 may be distinguished by the tail booms which extend forward over the leading edge of the wing on the FAW.2.

The Sea Vixen FAW.2 first flew in 1962 and entered service with front-line squadrons in 1964, with 29 being built and a further 67 ''FAW.1s'' being upgraded to ''FAW.2'' standard. The ''FAW.1'' began phasing out in 1966.

In 1972, the career of the Sea Vixen FAW.2 came to an end. It was planned to replace the Sea Vixen with the McDonnell Douglas Phantom, with both ''Ark Royal'' and ''Eagle'' to be refitted to take the new aircraft. In the event, due to defence cuts, following the decommissioning of HMS ''Eagle'' only ''Ark Royal'' was converted to take the new aircraft. 

A small number of Sea Vixen subsequently saw service in the less glamorous roles of drone, being redesignated '''Sea Vixen D.3'''. The D.3 variant is the only DH.110 design that was truly capable of supersonic speeds in level flight, thanks largely to uprated engine specifications and removal of many non-essential and military fitments. They were never used in the drone role and only a few were actually converted to the D 3 standard. The last remaining airworthy Sea Vixen was one of these. Other Sea Vixens became target tugs and were redesignated as '''TT.2'''.

==Operational history==

The aircraft did not take part in any true wars during its career with the Fleet Air Arm though it took part in many operations. In 1961, President Abdul Karim Kassem of Iraq threatened to annex the neighbouring oil-rich state of Kuwait. Kuwait appealed for external help. The United Kingdom dispatched a number of ships, including two fleet carriers to the region. Sea Vixens aboard the fleet carriers flew patrols in the region. Kassem's aggressive actions soon wilted in the face of such overwhelming naval might, thus averting a Gulf War over Kuwait.

In January 1964, trouble flared in the Tanganyika Rifles mutinied against the British officers and NCOs who, despite Tanganyika being independent, still commanded the regiment. The mutineers also seized the British HMS ''Centaur'', accompanied by 45 Commando, Royal Marines. The Sea Vixens, flying off ''Centaur'', performed a number of duties including the providing of cover for the Royal Marines who were landed in Tanganyika by helicopters. The operation to restore Tanganyika to stability ended in success. That same year, Sea Vixens saw service once again in the Persian Gulf. This time supporting British forces fighting against rebellious tribesmen in the Radfan, including launching air-strikes against the rebel tribesmen.

Sea Vixens saw further service during the 1960s, performing duties on HMS ''Albion'', HMS ''Centaur'' and HMS ''Eagle'' (carrying the Sea Vixens) and the LPD (Landing Platform Dock) HMS ''Fearless''.

The Sea Vixen also took to the skies in the aerobatic role, performing in two Royal Navy display teams: "Simon's Sircus" (sic) and "Fred's Five". A Sea Vixen with the UK civil registration of ''G-CVIX'' flew at air shows in Red Bull livery until 2007, when it was repainted in 899 NAS colours. ''G-CVIX'' is owned and operated by De Havilland Aviation and can be viewed at their hangar at Bournemouth Airport in Dorset, southern England, or at airshows around the country. Many other ''Sea Vixens'' remain in good condition but do not fly.

Die '''De Havilland D.H.110 Sea Vixen''' war ein zweistrahliger Allwetter-Marinejäger der FAA (Fleet Air Arm) aus dem Jahre 1951. Die Sea Vixen war ein Zweirumpfjäger. Sie war das erste Pfeilflügelflugzeug, dessen Flügel man einklappen konnte, ebenso das erste Flugzeug, das mit Flugkörpern, Raketen und Bomben gleichzeitig bestückt werden konnte.

==Geschichte==
Die Admiralität wünschte sich einen Ersatz für die veralteten D.H.112 „Sea Venom“. Die 50er Jahre an die Royal Navy verkaufen.

Der Prototyp hatte am 26. September 1951 seinen Erstflug. Allerdings kam es am 6. September 1952 zu einem schweren Flugunglück bei der Farnborough. Eine Sea Vixen stürzte in die Zuschauermenge, dabei starben inklusive der beiden Piloten insgesamt 31 Menschen. Ein weiterer Prototyp wurde daraufhin technisch überarbeitet. Zusätzlich gab es 1955 eine Version, deren Tragflächen nicht eingeklappt werden konnten. 1956 landete die erste Sea Vixen auf dem Flugzeugträger HMS Ark Royal. 1957 flog dann der erste Allwetterjäger die '''Sea Vixen FAW.20'''. Ab 1958 begann die Produktion von über hundert Flugzeugen des Typs '''FAW.1''' für die Marinestreitkräfte.

Die '''FAW.2''' war der Nachfolger der FAW.1 mit vielen Verbesserungen, wie Hawker Siddley Red Top Luftluft-Flugkörpern, Zusatztanks, bessere Notausstiegssysteme und Elektronik. Die erste FAW.2 flog 1962. Ab 1964 wurden 29 Maschinen in Dienst gestellt, dazu noch 16 alte FAW.1 auf die FAW.2-Variante umgebaut. Die FAW.1 wurde 1966 aus dem Dienst genommen.

1972 endete die Dienstzeit der FAW.2. Sie wurde durch die McDonnell Douglas Phantom ersetzt.

Heute gibt es nur noch eine flugfähige Sea Vixen, die Getränkehersteller Red Bull auf Flugschauen Werbung macht. Einige andere sind in Museen erhalten.

==Einsätze==
Die Sea Vixen nahm nie direkt an Kriegshandlungen teil, allerdings unterstützte sie indirekt englische Verbände in einigen Krisenherden. 1961 bedrohte der Irak das kleine Emirat Kuwait, dabei flogen Sea Vixen auf Wunsch des Emirats Patrouillen in der Region.

1964 kam es zu einer Revolte in HMS Centaur aus.
