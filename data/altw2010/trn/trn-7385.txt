'''Manuel I. Komnenos''' (''Μανουήλ Α' Κομνηνός''; * byzantinischer Kaiser. Er gilt als einer der letzten bedeutenden Herrscher von Byzanz. Eine wichtige Quelle für seine Regierungszeit stellt das Geschichtswerk des Niketas Choniates dar.

== Leben ==

Manuel war der vierte Sohn Johannes’ II. Komnenos. Er wurde nach dem Tod seines Vaters zum Kaiser ausgerufen, obwohl er einen älteren Bruder hatte (Isaak). Seine Herrschaft bedeutete eine späte Glanzstunde für das byzantinische Reich, worauf jedoch der endgültige Niedergang als Großmacht folgte, an dem er aufgrund seiner letztlich gescheiterten Politik eine gewisse Mitschuld trägt. 

Manuel forcierte die byzantinische Expansionspolitik auf dem Balkan, wobei jedoch sein Plan für ein ungarisch-byzantinisches Bündnis scheiterte. Die territorialen Streitigkeiten in Dalmatien und Kroatien um die Vorherrschaft auf dem Balkan gipfelten in der Konrad III., den er während des 2. Kreuzzugs kennen gelernt hatte, und mit dem er auch ein Bündnis einging (1148 in Friedrich I. kam. 1158 mussten sich die Truppen zurückziehen. Darauf verbündete er sich mit dem normannischen Sizilien gegen Friedrich und unterstützte auch die oberitalienischen Städte in ihrem Kampf gegen Barbarossa. Verhandlungen mit Papst Alexander III. führten fast zur Anerkennung Manuels als gesamtrömischer Kaiser, während Friedrich von Alexander gebannt worden war. Als der Papst 1168 diesen letzten Schritt verweigerte, um nicht in byzantinische Abhängigkeit zu geraten, kam es 1172 zu einer erneuten Annäherung zwischen Manuel und Barbarossa. Keiner dieser politischen Züge erzielte jedoch einen durchschlagenden Erfolg in Italien.

Dafür war Manuels Politik im Osten um so erfolgreicher. Dort gewann er Maria Komnena).  Währenddessen kämpfte Manuels fähiger General Venedigs setzte er ein Bündnis mit Genua und Pisa entgegen. Die byzantinische Präsenz in Anatolien wurde in seiner Regierungszeit verstärkt, allerdings kam es 1176 zur Schlacht von Myriokephalon, in der Manuel unterlag. Dadurch wurden seine Erfolge in diesem Raum zunichte gemacht. Dies bedeutete auch das Ende der byzantinischen Rückeroberungspolitik in Kleinasien und war der Beginn des endgültigen Verlustes dieses wichtigen Gebiets an die Türken. Es ist allerdings auch fraglich, ob der Versuch, sich nur auf Kleinasien zu konzentrieren, Erfolg gehabt hätte, besonders aufgrund der Landnahme durch die Türken. Die Ressourcen, die zu einer dauerhaften Befriedung der Region notwendig gewesen wäre, hätte die Kraft von Byzanz vielleicht überstiegen.

Der Kaiser selbst war vom Rittertum fasziniert, wie er überhaupt dem Westen zugeneigt war wie kaum ein anderer byzantinischer Herrscher und dort durchaus auch Respekt genoss. Unter seiner Regierung kam es zu einer wirtschaftlichen und kulturellen Blüte in Byzanz. Neben den Verhandlungen mit Papst Alexander III. versuchte er auch durch Kontaktaufnahme zu syrischen Monophysiten und zur armenischen Kirche die Einheit des Christentums wiederherzustellen. Seine weit ausgreifende Bündnispolitik, verknüpft mit einer geschickten Heiratspolitik, sorgte dafür, dass Byzanz ein letztes Mal als Großmacht auftreten konnte.

:''For the eldest son of Andronikos I Komnenos and father of Alexios I of Trebizond, see Manuel Komnenos (born 1145).''

'''Manuel I Komnenos''', or '''Comnenus''' (, ''Manouēl I Komnēnos'', Byzantine Emperor of the 12th century who reigned over a crucial turning point in the history of Mediterranean. Eager to restore his empire to its past glories as the superpower of the Mediterranean world, Manuel pursued an energetic and ambitious foreign policy. In the process he made alliances with the Crusader kingdoms of Hungary and Outremer under Byzantine Myriokephalon, which in large part resulted from his arrogance in attacking a well-defended Seljuk position.

Called ''Megas'' ( translated as "dynasty he represented; they also argue Byzantine imperial power declined so rapidly after Manuel's death that it is only natural to look for the causes of this decline in his reign.<ref name="M3-4">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 3–4</ref>

==Accession to the throne==

Manuel Komnenos was the fourth son of St. Ladislaus. Having distinguished himself in his father's war against the Seljuk Turks, in 1143 Manuel was chosen as his successor by John, in preference to his elder surviving brother Isaac. After John died on Great Palace with instant access to the imperial treasure and regalia. Axouch arrived in the capital even before news of the emperor's death had reached it. He quickly secured the loyalty of the city, and when Manuel entered the capital in August 1143, he was crowned by the new Patriarch, Michael Kourkouas. A few days later, with nothing more to fear as his position as emperor was now secure, Manuel ordered the release of Isaac.<ref name="NGS">Gibbon, ''The decline and fall of the Roman Empire'', 72<br/>* J.H.

Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 87-88</ref>

The empire that Manuel inherited from his father had undergone great changes since its foundation by Constantine, eight centuries before. The most obvious change had occurred in the seventh century: the soldiers of Islam had taken Egypt, Palestine and much of Syria away from the empire irrevocably. They had then swept on westwards into what in the time of Constantine had been the western provinces of the Roman Empire, in North Africa and Spain. In the centuries since, the emperors had ruled over a realm that largely consisted of Asia Minor in the east, and the Balkans in the west. Since the time of his predecessor Justinian I (527–565), the emperors had also ruled over parts of Italy, Africa and Spain. Yet the empire that Manuel inherited was a polity facing formidable challenges. At the end of the 11th century, the Normans of Sicily had removed Italy from the control of the Byzantine Emperor. The Seljuk Turks had done the same with central Anatolia. And in the Levant, a new force had appeared &ndash; the Crusader states &ndash; who presented the Byzantine Empire with new challenges. Now, more than at any time during the preceding centuries, the task facing the emperor was daunting indeed.<ref name="PLBr"></ref>

== Second Crusade and Raynald of Chatillon ==

=== Prince of Antioch ===
thumb|The County of Edessa in the context of the other states of the [[Near East in 1135.]]

The first test of Manuel's reign came in 1144, when he was faced with a demand by Raymond, Prince of Antioch for the cession of Cilician territories. However, later that year the crusader County of Edessa was engulfed by the tide of a resurgent Islamic jihad under Imad ad-Din Atabeg Zengi. Raymond realised that immediate help from the west was out of the question.  With his eastern flank now dangerously exposed to this new threat, there seemed little option but for him to prepare for a humiliating visit to Constantinople. Swallowing his pride, he made the journey north to ask for the protection of the Emperor. After submitting to Manuel, he was promised the support that he had requested, and his allegiance to Byzantium was secured.<ref name="M173">J. Cinnamus, ''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus'', 33–35<br/>* P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 40</ref>

===An Expedition against Konya===

In 1146 Manuel set out on a punitive expedition against Masud the Sultan of Rûm, who had been repeatedly violating the frontiers of the Empire in western Anatolia and Cilicia.  There was no attempt at a systematic conquest of territory but the Byzantine forces reached Masud's capital, Konya; they ravaged the area around the city but could not assault its walls. Manuel destroyed the fortified town of Philomelion, removing its remaining Christian population.  Amongst his motives for mounting this razzia there included a wish to be seen in the West as actively espousing the crusading ideal; Kinnamos also attributed to Manuel a desire to show off his martial prowess to his new bride.<ref>J. Cinnamus, ''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus'', 47<br/>* P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 42</ref>  Whilst on this campaign Manuel received a letter from Louis VII of France announcing his intention of leading an army to the relief of the crusader states.

=== Arrival of the Crusaders ===
Manuel was prevented from following up his early successes in the east, for events to the west meant that his presence was urgently required in the Balkans. In 1147 he granted a passage through his dominions to two armies of the Second Crusade under Conrad III of Germany and Louis VII of France. At this time, there were still members of the Byzantine court who remembered the passage of the First Crusade, which was a defining event in the collective memory of the age and one which had fascinated Manuel's aunt, Anna Komnene.<ref name="AC333">A. Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', 333</ref> 

thumb|left|Arrival of the Second Crusade before Constantinople as portrayed in Jean Fouquet's painting from around 1455–1460, ''Arrivée des croisés à Constantinople''.

Many Byzantines feared the Crusade, a view endorsed by the numerous acts of vandalism and theft practiced by the unruly armies as they marched through Byzantine territory. Byzantine troops followed the Crusaders, attempting to police their behaviour, and further troops were assembled in Constantinople, ready to defend the capital against any acts of aggression. This cautious approach was well advised, but still the numerous incidents of covert and open hostility between the Franks and the Greeks on their line of march, for which it seems both sides were to blame, nearly precipitated a conflict between Manuel and his guests. Manuel took the precaution &ndash; which his grandfather had not taken &ndash; of making repairs to the city walls, and pressed the two kings for guarantees concerning the security of his territories. Conrad's army was the first to enter the Byzantine territory in the summer of 1147, and it figures more prominently in the Byzantine sources, which imply that it was the most troublesome of the two. 

After 1147, however, the relations between the two leaders became friendlier. By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law Frederick I Barbarossa.

===Cyprus invaded===

Manuel answers that he is willing to receive the French army and to support it, but he complains about receiving the letter from an envoy of the King of France and not from an ambassador sent by the Pope.<ref name="Vat">[http://asv.vatican.va/en/doc/1146.htm Letter by the Emperor Manuel I Komnenos], Vatican Secret Archives.</ref>]]

Yet Manuel's attention was to be drawn to Antioch again in 1156, when C. Hillenbrand, ''The Imprisonment of Raynald of Chatillon'', 80<br/>* T.F. Madden, ''The New Concise History of the Crusades'', 65</ref> Raynald also sent some of the mutilated hostages to Constantinople as a vivid demonstration of his disobedience and his contempt for the Byzantine emperor.<ref name="R239" />

Manuel responded to this outrage in a characteristically energetic way. In the winter of 1158–59, he marched to Cilicia at the head of a huge army; the speed of his advance (Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry) was such that he managed to surprise the Armenian Thoros of Cilicia, who had participated in the attack on Cyprus.<ref name="M67">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 67</ref> All the towns and cities of Cilicia fell to Manuel immediately, and Thoros himself was forced to flee into the mountains at the last moment: he is said to have survived by sheltering alone under rocks on a hillside, where an old shepherd would bring him food to keep him alive.

===Manuel in Antioch===
Meanwhile, news of the advance of the Byzantine army soon reached Antioch. Realising that he had no hope of defeating Manuel, Raynald also knew that he could not expect any help from king Baldwin III of Jerusalem. Baldwin did not approve of Raynald's attack on Cyprus, and in any case had already made an agreement with Manuel. Thus isolated and abandoned by his allies, Raynald decided that abject submission was his only hope. He appeared before the Emperor, dressed in a sack and with a rope tied around his neck, and begged for forgiveness. Manuel at first ignored the prostrate Raynald, chatting with his courtiers; William of Tyre commented that this ignominious scene continued for so long that all present were "disgusted" by it.<ref>B. Hamilton, ''William of Tyre and the Byzantine Empire'', 226<br/>* William of Tyre, ''Historia'', XVIII, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/18.html#23 23]</ref> Eventually, Manuel forgave Raynald on condition that he became a vassal of the Empire, effectively surrendering the independence of Antioch to Byzantium.<ref name="Stone" />

thumb|left|Antioch under Byzantine protection (during 1159–1180)

Peace having been restored, a grand ceremonial procession was staged on April 12, 1159 for the triumphant entry of the Byzantine army into the city, with Manuel riding through the streets on horseback while the Prince of Antioch and the King of Jerusalem followed on foot. Manuel dispensed justice to the citizens, and presided over games and tournaments for the crowd. In May at the head of a united Christian army he started on the road to Edessa, but he abandoned the campaign, when he secured the release by Nur ad-Din, the ruler of Syria, of 6,000 Christian prisoners captured in various battles since the second Crusade.<ref name=Norwich>Z.N. Brooke, ''A History of Europe, from 911 to 1198'', 482<br/>* P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 67<br/>* J.H. Norwich, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref> Despite the glorious end of the expedition, it is argued by modern scholars that Manuel finally achieved much less than he hoped in terms of imperial restoration.

Satisfied with his efforts thus far, Manuel headed back to Constantinople. On their way back, his troops were surprised in line of march by the Turks. Despite this, they won a complete victory, routing the enemy army from the field and inflicting heavy losses. In the following year he drove the Seljuk Turks out of Isauria.<ref name="P134">K. Paparrigopoulos, ''History of the Greek Nation'', Db, 134</ref>

==Italian campaign==
===Roger II of Sicily===

In 1147 Manuel was faced with war by Venetians, who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet. In 1149, Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent George of Antioch with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs.<ref name="Nor">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 98 and 103</ref> Manuel had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily. The renewal of the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel's foreign policy for the rest of his reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad's death.<ref name="M621" />

The death of Roger in February 1154, who was succeeded by William I, combined with the widespread rebellions against the rule of the new King in Sicily and Michael Palaiologos and Robert of Loritello, Manuel's expedition achieved astonishingly rapid progress as the whole of southern Italy rose up in rebellion against the Sicilian Crown, and the untried William I.<ref name="M621" /> There followed a string of spectacular successes as numerous strongholds yielded either to force or the lure of gold.<ref name=Norwich />

=== Papal-Byzantine alliance ===
The city of Catapanate of Southern Italy for centuries before the arrival of the Normans, opened its gates to the Emperor's army, and the overjoyed citizens tore down the Norman citadel. After the fall of Bari, the cities of Trani, Giovinazzo, Andria, Taranto, and Brindisi were also captured, and William who arrived with his army (which included 2,000 knights) was heavily defeated.<ref name="N112-113">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 112-113</ref>

Encouraged by the success, Manuel dreamed of restoration of the Roman Empire at cost of union between Orthodox and Catholic Church, a prospect which would frequently be offered to the Pope during negotiations and plans for alliance.<ref name="Vas7">Pope Hadrian IV's interests to reach a deal if at all possible, since doing so would greatly increase his own influence over the entire Orthodox Christian population. Manuel offered a large sum of money to the Pope for the provision of troops, with the request that the Pope grant the Byzantine emperor lordship of three maritime cities in return for assistance in expelling William from Sicily. Manuel also promised to pay 5,000 pounds of gold to the Pope and the Curia.<ref name="W18-2">William of Tyre, ''Historia'', XVIII, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/18.html#2 2]</ref> Negotiations were hurriedly carried out, and an alliance was formed between Manuel and Hadrian.<ref name="D122" />

It was at this point, just as the war seemed decided in Manuel's favour, that things started to go wrong for him. The Byzantine commander Michael Palaiologos had alienated Byzantium's allies by his attitude, and this had stalled the campaign as Count Aegean coast of Greece in 1156.<ref name="M61J">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 116<br>* P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 61</ref>

===Failure of the Church union===
thumb|Pope Hadrian IV, who negotiated with Manuel against the Norman King [[William I of Sicily]]

During the Italian campaign, and, afterwards, during the struggle of the Papal Curia with Frederick, Manuel tried to seduce the Popes by hints of a possible union between the Eastern and Western Churches. Although in 1155 Pope Hadrian had expressed his eagerness to prompt the reunion of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, hopes for a lasting Papal-Byzantine alliance came up against insuperable problems. Pope Hadrian IV and his successors demanded recognition of their religious authority over all Christians everywhere, and wished themselves to reach superiority over the Byzantine Emperor; they were not at all willing to fall into a state of dependence from one emperor to the other.<ref name="Vas7" /> Manuel, on the other side, wanted an official recognition of his secular authority on both East and West.<ref name="B114">J.W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 114</ref> Such conditions would not be accepted by either side. Even if a pro-western Emperor such as Manuel agreed to it, the Greek citizens of the Empire would have rejected outright any union of this sort, as they did almost three hundred years later when the Orthodox and Catholic churches were briefly united under the Pope. In spite of his friendliness towards the Roman Church and his cordial relations with all the Popes, Manuel was never honoured with the title of ''Augustus'' by the Popes. And although he sent twice (in 1167 and 1169) an embassy to Pope Alexander III offering to reunite the Greek and Latin churches, the latter refused, under pretext of the troubles that would follow that union.<ref name="AGB">Abbé Guettée, ''The Papacy'', [http://www.geocities.com/trvalentine/orthodox/guettee10.html Chapter VII]<br/>* J.W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 114</ref> Ultimately, a deal proved elusive, and the two churches have remained divided.  

The final results of the Italian campaign were limited in terms of the advantages gained by the Empire. The city of Ancona became a Byzantine base in Italy, accepting the Emperor as sovereign. The Normans of Sicily had been damaged, and now came to terms with the Empire, ensuring peace for the rest of Manuel's reign. The Empire's ability to get involved in Italian affairs had been demonstrated. However, given the enormous quantities of gold which had been lavished on the project, it also demonstrated the limits of what money and diplomacy alone could achieve. The expense of Manuel's involvement in Italy must have cost the treasury a great deal (probably more than 2,160,000 ''hyperpyra'' or 30,000 pounds of gold), and yet it produced only limited solid gains.<ref name="B116">J.W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 116</ref><ref name="Tread643">W. Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 643</ref>

===Byzantine policy in Italy after 1158===
thumb|left|Frederick Barbarossa submits to the authority of Pope Alexander III after his defeat at the Battle of Legnano ([[fresco in the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, by Spinello Aretino).]]

After 1158 and under the new conditions, the aims of the Byzantine policy changed. Now Manuel decided to oppose the tendency of the Venice. In March 1171 Manuel had suddenly broken with Venice, ordering all 20,000 Venetians on imperial territory to be arrested and their property confiscated.<ref name="MV93">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 93</ref> Venice, incensed, sent a fleet of 120 ships against Byzantium, which, owing to an epidemic and being pursued by 150 Byzantine ships, was forced to return without great success.<ref name="Nor4">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 131</ref> In all probability, friendly relations between Byzantium and Venice were not restored in Manuel's lifetime.<ref name="Vas7" />

== Balkan frontier ==
On his northern frontier Manuel expended considerable effort to preserve the conquests made by Balkan frontier, Manuel was kept from his main objective, the subjugation of the Normans of Sicily. Relations had been good with the Serbs and Hungarians since 1129, so the Serb rebellion came as a shock. The Serbs of Rascia, being so induced by Roger II of Sicily, invaded Byzantine territory in 1149.<ref name="Stone" />

thumb|A ''[[Byzantine coinage|Hyperpyron'', a form of Byzantine coinage, issued by Manuel.  One side of the coin (left image) depicts Christ.  The other side depicts Manuel (right image).]]

Manuel forced the rebellious Serbs, and their leader, Uroš II, to vassalage (1150&ndash;1152).<ref name="CSxxiii">Curta, ''Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages'', xxiii</ref> He then made repeated attacks upon the Hungarians with a view to annexing their territory along the Sava. In the wars of 1151&ndash;1153 and 1163&ndash;1168 Manuel led his troops into Hungary and a spectacular raid deep into enemy territory yielded substantial war booty. In 1167, Manuel sent an army of 25,000 men under the command of Andronikos Kontostephanos against the Hungarians. Kontostephanos scored a decisive victory at the Hungarian Kingdom by which Bosnia, and Dalmatia were ceded. By 1168 nearly the whole of the eastern Adriatic coast lay in Manuel's hands.<ref name="JWS372">J.W. Sedlar, ''East Central Europe in the Middle Ages'', 372</ref> 

Efforts were also made for diplomatic annex. The Hungarian heir Béla, younger brother of the Hungarian king Stephen III, was sent to Constantinople to be educated in the court of Manuel, who intended the youth to marry his daughter, Maria, and to make him his heir, thus securing the union of Hungary with the Empire. In the court Béla assumed the name Alexius and received the title of ''Despot'' which had previously been applied only to the Emperor himself. However, two unforeseen dynastic events drastically altered the situation. In 1169, Manuel's young wife gave birth to a son, thus depriving Béla of his status as heir of the Byzantine throne (although Manuel would not renounce the Croatian lands he had taken from Hungary). Then, in 1172, Stephen died childless, and Béla went home to take his throne. Before leaving Constantinople, he swore a solemn oath to Manuel that he would always "keep in mind the interests of the emperor and of the Romans". Béla III kept his word: as long as Manuel lived, he made no attempt to retrieve his Croatian inheritance, which he only afterwards reincorporated into Hungary.<ref name="JWS372" />

==Relations with Russia==
Manuel Komnenos attempted to draw the Russian principalities into his net of diplomacy directed against Hungary, and to a lesser extent Norman Sicily.  This polarised the Russian princes into pro- and anti-Byzantine camps.  In the late 1140s three princes were competing for primacy in Russia: prince Galicia is described as Manuel's vassal (''hypospondos'').  Galicia was situated on the northern and northeastern borders of Hungary and, therefore, was of great strategic importance in the Byzantine-Hungarian conflicts.  Following the deaths of both Iziaslav and Vladimirko, the situation became reversed, when Yuri of Suzdal, Manuel's ally, took over Kiev and Yaroslav, the new ruler of Galicia, adopted a pro-Hungarian stance.  

In 1164-5 Manuel's cousin Andronikos, the future emperor, escaped from captivity in Byzantium, and fled to the court of  Yaroslav in Galicia.  This situation, holding out the alarming prospect of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel's throne sponsored by both Galicia and Hungary, spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry of diplomacy.  Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople (1165). A mission to Kiev, then ruled by Prince Rostislav, resulted in a favourable treaty and a pledge to supply the Empire with auxiliary troops; Yaroslav of Galicia was also persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return fully into the imperial fold.  As late as the year 1200 the princes of Galicia were providing invaluable services against the Empire's, at this time Cuman, enemies.<ref>D. Obolensky, ''The Byzantine Commonwealth'', 299-302.</ref> 

The restoration of relations with Galicia had an immediate benefit for Manuel when, in 1166, he dispatched two armies to attack the eastern provinces of Hungary in a vast pincer movement. One army crossed the Walachian Plain and entered Hungary through the Transylvanian Alps (Southern Carpathians), whilst the other army made a wide circuit to Galicia, and with Galician aid, crossed the Carpathian Mountains. Since the Hungarians had most of their forces concentrated on the Sirmium and Belgrade frontier they were caught off guard by the Byzantine invasion and the Hungarian province of Transylvania was thoroughly ravaged by the Byzantine armies.<ref>M. Angold, ''The Byzantine Empire, 1025–1204'', 177.</ref>

==Invasion of Egypt==
===Alliance with the Kingdom of Jerusalem===
thumb|left|The marriage of Amalric I of Jerusalem and Maria Comnena at [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre in 1167 (from a manuscript of William of Tyre's ''Historia'', painted in Paris c. 1295–1300, ''Bibliothèque Municipale'', Épinal).]]

Control of Egypt was a decades-old dream of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, and king Maria Komnene in 1167, and "swore all that his brother Baldwin had sworn before." A formal alliance was negotiated in 1168, whereby the two rulers arranged for a conquest and partition of Egypt, with Manuel taking the coastal area, and Amalric the interior. In the autumn of 1169 Manuel sent a joint expedition with Amalric to Egypt: a Byzantine army and a naval force of 20 large transports, under the command of the ''megas doux'' Andronikos Kontostephanos joined forces with Amalric at Ascalon.<ref name="M74" /><ref name="fleet">J. Phillips, ''The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople'', 158</ref> William of Tyre, who negotiated the alliance, was impressed in particular by the large transport ships which were used to transport the cavalry forces of the army.<ref name=William>William of Tyre, ''A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea''</ref>

Although such a long range attack on a state far from the centre of the Empire may seem extraordinary (the last time the Empire had attempted anything on this scale was the failed invasion of Sicily over one hundred and twenty years earlier), it can be explained in terms of Manuel's foreign policy, which was to use the Latins to ensure the survival of the Empire. This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that in the context of the wider struggle between the crusader states and the Islamic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be the deciding factor. It had been becoming clear that the ailing Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt held the key to the fate of the crusader states. If Egypt came out of its isolation, and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble.<ref name="M73" />

A successful invasion of Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire. Egypt was a rich province, and in the days of the Roman Empire had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the Arabs in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only in order to deflect Latins' ambitions away from Antioch, but also in order to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.<ref name="M73" />
