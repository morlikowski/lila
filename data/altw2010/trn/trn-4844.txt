'''Carl Edwin Wieman''' (born American laureate for his production in 1995 with Eric Allin Cornell, the first true Bose-Einstein condensate. 

==Biography==
Wieman was born in B.S. in 1973 from Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1977; he was also awarded a Doctor of Science, ''honoris causa'' from the University of Chicago in 1997. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1998. In 2001, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Eric Allin Cornell and Wolfgang Ketterle. In 2004, he was named United States Professor of the Year among all doctoral and research universities.

Wieman joined the University of British Columbia on 1 January 2007 and is heading a well-endowed science education initiative there; he retains a twenty percent appointment at University of Colorado, Boulder to head the science education project he founded in Colorado.<ref></ref>

In the past several years, Wieman has been particularly involved with efforts at improving National Academy of Sciences. He has used and promotes pedagogical system, where teachers repeatedly ask multiple-choice concept questions during class, and students reply on the spot with little wireless "clicker" devices. If a large proportion of the class chooses a wrong answer, students discuss among themselves and reply again.<ref></ref> In 2007, Wieman was awarded the Oersted Medal, which recognizes notable contributions to the teaching of physics, by the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT).
