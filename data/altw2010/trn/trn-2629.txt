The '''GSX-R1000''' is a GSX-R series of GSX-R1100 and is powered by a liquid-cooled  inline four-cylinder 4-stroke engine.

==History==
===2001===

For 2001 Suzuki introduced a new GSX-R model that replaced the largest and most powerful model of the GSX-R series sport bike, the GSX-R1100, with the all new GSX-R1000. As the model name revealed, the engine's cylinder displacement was  smaller than its predecessor. The GSX-R1000 was not just an enlarged version of the GSX-R750, although it shared many features with its little brother. The main frame is the same in both models, but the material used on the big brother was  thicker. Suzuki claimed the torsional rigidity of the frame had increased 10% in comparison with the GSX-R750. The dimensions of the bike had more in common with the GP racer Suzuki RGV500 than the GSX-R750.

The GSX-R1000 engine was a redesigned GSX-R750 engine. The R1000 had a  bigger bore and  longer stroke, newly designed pistons with lower crown, and gear-driven counter balancer. The engine weighs  which was slightly heavier than the 750 engine but  lighter than the engine of the GSX1300R. The performance of the engine is a peak of  at 9,500&nbsp;rpm<ref name="Bikez Motorcycle Encyclopedia">[http://www.bikez.com/motorcycles/suzuki_gsx-r_1000_2001.php GSX-R 1000 K1 specifications] from Bikez Motorcycle Encyclopedia</ref> as measured on the crank and <ref name="Street Bike dyno charts">[http://www.sportrider.com/bikes/street_bike_dyno_charts Dyno charts] from Street Bike</ref> when measured on the rear wheel with small variations between different instances of the same model, the redline is set at 12,000&nbsp;rpm. The maximum torque of the engine is  at 8,000&nbsp;rpm. Combined with a total (dry) weight of  this gives the GSX-R1000 a top speed of , a 1/4&nbsp;mile time of 9.3 seconds at , and a 0 to  time in 3 seconds.

Using titanium for the exhaust pipe and the inside of the silencer, the R1000's exhaust system had become 4&nbsp;pounds lighter compared with the 750. Titanium was also used in the front fork. The inner tubes were coated with the resistant material. A unique exhaust tuning valve had been mounted inside the exhaust pipe. Using a servo the system dynamically adjusted the exhaust back pressure, according to engine speed, throttle position, and gear selection for increased torque, lower emissions, and decreased noise -- the (stock) exhaust noise of the GSX-R1000 is notably lower than that of the GSX-R600.

With the 2001 model of the GSX-R 1000 the 1998 Yamaha YZF-R1 was finally surpassed with the GSX-R being lighter and more powerful. <ref name="MC daily review">[http://www.motorcycledaily.com/25jan01suzuki2001gsxr1000review2.html Motorcycledaily review] from Motorcycle daily</ref>

The 2001 model carried over to 2002 with minimal changes. 2002 introduced i.a. modifications to the fuel pump and luggage hooks. The manual fast-idle was replaced with a computer operated implementation (the "STV servo"). The color options were changed to replace the pearl black and metallic silver with a candy blue and pearl black scheme.

===2003===

After the GSX-R1000 had been three years on the roads and race tracks, Suzuki put out a new version of the model in late September of 2002. Suzuki engineers had been working on the three things that made a fast bike faster; weight, power and handling. The 2003 year's GSX-R1000 was improved in all three counts. It weighed less, had more power/torque and handled better.

The physical dimensions of the bike were almost identical with the previous year's model. The seat height and the overall height were somewhat lower but the geometry of the bike was exactly the same as before. The already rigid aluminum alloy frame was newly designed and enforced with internal ribs. The frame as well as the wheels were now coated black.

The front brakes were also new. Suzuki decided to drop the six-piston calipers. The new radially-mounted four-piston calipers weigh 30&nbsp;grams less and grip smaller  discs that save another . Though smaller, Suzuki claimed that the new brakes provide better stopping and turn-in performance.

The headlights of the 2003 year's GSX-R1000 were mounted vertically to enable the ram-air intakes in the front to be placed  nearer the bike's center line. The new design was very much inspired by the look of the Hayabusa. The instruments were also redesigned.

The cylinder displacement of the engine remained the same  centimeters but more power/torque and better throttle response had been achieved by adding four ventilation holes between the cylinders to equalize crankcase pressure beneath the pistons, moving the air intake nearer to the centerline and upgrading the engine management system from a 16-bit to a 32-bit ECU. The entire exhaust system was now made of titanium to save an additional  and the tail light was replaced with LEDs.
