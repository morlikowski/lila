Through publications, conferences and policy recommendations, we seek to guide global leaders in government and business."<ref name=HIMS/>

In the 1970s, Hudson’s scholars advocated a turn away from the "no-growth" policies of the Baltic nations on becoming market economies; it assisted in drafting the Wisconsin welfare reform law.

The Institute has taken positions critical of environmentalism. Dennis Avery, as Director of the Hudson's Center for Global Food Issues, has written in opposition to those who favor the adoption of organic agricultural methods.<ref name=Burros>Marian Burros, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503EFD8103AF934A25751C0A96F958260 "Eating Well; Anti-Organic, And Flawed"], ''The New York Times'', accessed December 14, 2007.</ref>

ISBN 1-58542-139-1.</ref>

Fundraising efforts use testimonials from what the Institute calls its "family of generous supporters and friends", among them, Henry Kissinger, who provides a testimonial:  "Hudson Institute is today one of America's foremost policy research centers, in the forefront of study and debate on important domestic and international policy issues, known and respected around the globe, a leader in innovative thinking and creative solutions to the challenges of the present and the future."<ref>The Hudson Institute, [http://www.hudson.org/invest/index.cfm?fuseaction=appreciation "Meet our Family of Generous Supporters and Friends"], accessed April 15, 2008.</ref>

Some question the institute's position on many issues. An example is their view of food production and the large sums they receive from food companies. The New York Times commented on Dennis Avery's attacks on Organic farming: "The attack on organic food by a well-financed research organization suggests that, though organic food accounts for only 1 percent of food sales in the United States, the conventional food industry is worried."<ref name=Burros/>
