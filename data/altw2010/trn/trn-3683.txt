'''Tigerhaj''' (''Galeocerdo cuvier'') är en fiskart i familjen gråhajar. Tigerhajen har fått sitt namn av de mörka streck som den har när den är ung, men som blir svagare när hajen blir äldre. Tigerhajen blir normalt tre till fem meter lång, men kan ibland bli upp till nio meter lång, och väga upp till ett ton.

Tigerhajen använder sina tänder till mycket. De vassa spetsarna håller fast bytet, medan de sågformade nedre eggarna går bra att skära med. Tänderna är starka och kan skära igenom skalet på en sköldpadda. De kan bita med en kraft på 60 kg. Som hos nästan alla hajarter ersätts tigerhajens tänder kontinuerligt. Om en tand bryts av ersätts den mycket snart av en ny som flyttas fram från raden bakom. Tigerhajen är känd för att äta nästan vad som helst. Den äter havssköldpaddor, andra hajar, även andra tigerhajar, sälar, fiskar, människor, kadaver och diverse avfall. 

Tigerhajens käftar sitter bara löst fästa vid huvudet med muskler och ligament, så att de kan skjutas fram när den hugger till. När den äter av ett stort byte skakar den huvudet fram och tillbaka för att slita loss ordentliga bitar. 

Tigerhajarna simmar i de varma vattnen runt öar och utanför kontinenternas kuster. Tigerhajar finns i alla tropiska och subtropiska hav. De är vanligast i centrala Stilla havet. Ofta närmar de sig land nattetid för att skaffa mat. I Hawaii frossar tigerhajarna på albatrosser. I Indiska Oceanen och Stora Oceanen lever de på fisk, andra hajar, sälar och saltvattenskrokodilungar. Tigerhajen attackerar sällan människor, men ibland sker attacker. Tigerhajen räknas som den näst farligaste hajen för människor. (Den farligaste hajarten anses vara tjurhaj.)

När två tigerhajar parar sig simmar de tätt intill varandra. De lägger inte ägg som vissa andra hajar, utan föder levande ungar, vars ägg har kläckts innan de lämnar modern. Tigerhajen får ungar ungefär en gång om året, och då föds 10 till 80 ungar. Dessa kan simma när de föds och klarar sig således själva.

The '''tiger shark''', ''Galeocerdo cuvier'', the second largest predatory kg (850 to 2000&nbsp;lb).<ref></ref> It is found in many of the tropical and temperate regions of the world's oceans, and is especially common around islands in the central Pacific. This shark is a solitary hunter, usually hunting at night. Its name is derived from the dark stripes down its body, which fade as the shark matures. 

The tiger shark is a seals, surfers in Hawaii and is often referred to as "the wastebasket of the sea".

A tiger shark may be easily identified due to its dark stripes which are similar to a tiger pattern. It also has dorsal fins that are distinctively close to its tail. These sharks are often large in size and may encounter humans because they often visit shallow reefs, harbours and canals.

The tiger shark is second only to the great white shark, coming close with the bull shark in number of recorded attacks on humans<ref name="sharkAttackStats"></ref> and is considered, along with the great white, bull shark, and the oceanic whitetip shark to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans.<ref></ref> This may be due to its aggressive nature and frequency of human contact as it often inhabits populated waters such as Hawaiian beaches.

==Taxonomy==
The shark was first described by Peron and Lessueur in 1822 and was given the name ''Squalus cuvier''.<ref name="ITIS"></ref> Müller and Henle, in 1837 renamed it ''Galeocerdo tigrinus''.<ref name="Florida"/> The genus, ''Galeocerdo'', is derived from the Greek, ''galeos'' which means shark and the Latin ''cerdus'' which means the hard hairs of pigs.<ref name="Florida"/> It is often colloquially called the man-eater shark.<ref name="Florida"/>

The tiger shark is a member of the order family, commonly referred to as requiem sharks. This family includes some other well known sharks such as the blue shark, lemon shark and bull shark.

The largest tiger shark specimen was 7.3 m (24 ft) and is a contender for the largest carnivorous fish alongside the great white shark. 

==Distribution==
The tiger shark is often found close to the coast, in mainly tropical and sub-tropical waters, though they can reside in temperate waters. Tiger sharks are the second largest predatory shark other that the great white.<ref name="Florida"/> The shark's behavior is primarily nomadic, but is guided by warmer currents, and it stays closer to the equator throughout the colder months. The shark tends to stay in deep waters that line reefs but does move into channels to pursue prey in shallower waters. In the western Pacific Ocean, the shark has been found as far north as Japan and as far south as New Zealand.<ref name="fishbase"></ref>

The shark has been recorded down to a depth of <ref name="Florida"/> but is also known to move into shallow water - water that would normally be considered too shallow for a species of its size. It is also frequently found in river estuaries and harbors. At night it is usually found in shallow water.

==Anatomy and appearance==
Its skin can typically range from a blue to light green with a white or light yellow underbelly. The distinguishing dark spots and stripes are most outstanding in young sharks and fade as the shark matures. Tiger sharks regularly weigh 385 to 635 kg and  is usually 3 m to 6 m long. The heaviest tiger shark recorded to date, was caught in Newcastle, NSW, Australia in 1954 and measured 7.3 m, scaled 1,524 kg. It has been estimated that the tiger shark can swim at a maximum speed of around 32 km/h, with short bursts of higher speeds that last only a few seconds.

The tiger shark's head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which makes it easy for the shark to turn quickly to one side. Tiger sharks, as with other sharks, have small pits on the side of their upper bodies which hold electrical sensors called the ampullae of lorenzini, enabling them to detect small muscle movements of other creatures, allowing them to hunt in darkness. In addition, the tiger shark, like many other sharks, has a reflective layer behind the retina called tapetum lucidum which allows light-sensing cells a second chance to capture photons of visible light, enhancing vision in low light condition. A tiger shark generally has long fins and a long upper tail; the long fins act like wings and provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, whereas the long tail provides bursts of speed. A tiger shark normally swims using little movements of its body. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on its axis.

Its teeth are highly specialized to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances such as the shells of sea turtles, and unusually among sharks, its upper and lower teeth have dissimilar shapes. Like most sharks, however, tiger shark teeth are continually replaced by rows of replacements from within its jaws.

==Diet==
The tiger shark, which generally hunts at night, has a reputation for eating anything it has access to, ignoring what seals, other sharks, and sense of smell which enable it to react to faint traces of blood in its waters and is able to follow them to the source. The tiger shark's ability to pick up on low-frequency pressure waves produced by the movements of swimming animals, for example the thrashing of an injured animal, enables the shark to find a variety of prey.

The shark is known to be number plates, suits of armour, and baseballs. For this reason, the tiger shark is often regarded as the ocean's garbage can.
<!--Unsourced:Recent information contradicts the notion that the tiger shark is a random and aggressive feeder, a description that has haunted the shark for the past 100 years. Although little has been documented on its behavior, in particular its feeding patterns, suggestions have been made that the tiger shark represents a high type of specialization, meaning that when its common food supply is low, it has the ability to modify its regular diet to incorporate other forms of prey.-->

==Reproduction==
The tiger shark breeds by internal fertilization. It is the only species in its family that is ovoviviparous; its eggs hatch internally and the young are born live when fully developed.  The male tiger shark will insert one of his claspers into the female's genital opening (cloaca), acting as a guide for the sperm to be introduced. The male uses its teeth to hold the female still during the procedure, often causing the female considerable discomfort. Mating in the northern hemisphere will generally take place between the months of March and May, with the young being born around April or June the following year. In the southern hemisphere, mating takes place in November, December, or early January.<ref name="Florida"/>

The young are nourished inside the mother's body for up to between 14 to 16 months, where the female can produce a litter ranging from 10 to 80 pups.<ref name="Florida"/> A newborn tiger shark is generally  to  long<ref name="Florida"/> and leaves its mother upon birth. It is unknown how long tiger sharks live, but it has been speculated to be 20 years.
