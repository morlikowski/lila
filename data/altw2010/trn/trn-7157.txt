'''''Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders''''' is the third of a series of direct-to-video animated films based upon the ''Scooby-Doo'' Saturday morning cartoons. It was released on October 3, 2000, and it was produced by Warner Bros. Animation (though it had a Hanna-Barbera Cartoons logo and copyright notice at the end).

== Plot ==

The story starts off when the Shaggy makes an accidental turn into government property. The sight of a UFO causes Shaggy to lose control of the vehicle, and find themselves on the outskirts of a small town. While Scooby and Shaggy stay with the van, the rest of the gang walks into a local diner to ask for directions. Shaggy and Scooby then encounter a fictional animal called a jackalope. 

Shaggy and Scooby run in the diner in panic while the ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You'' theme song is played, claming to have seen aliens. The diner waitress, Dottie, says that they never see the aliens but see strange lights and hear strange sounds at night. The chef, Sergio (pronounced "Serge") says that a month ago, local cattle vanished overnight without a trace and a lot of people moved away. A man named Lester claims to have been abducted once before, and believes the two. He also says that he has pictures, so the gang goes to his house to see them. They turn out to be nothing more than paintings by Lester, who offers to let the gang stay for the night. Daphne and Velma sleep in a bunk bed and Fred sleeps on Lester's couch.
