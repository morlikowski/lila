'''Radegast''' is a small town in the district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is administrated in the "Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Südliches Anhalt". It is the smallest town in Saxony-Anhalt and is located about 13 km south of the district capital of Köthen. 

== Geography ==

Radegast is located midway between the cities of Köthen (Anhalt), Wolfen, Bitterfeld and Dessau.  

=== Geographical Situation ===
The area of Radegast borders on the national park "Cösitzer Teich" in the southeast and on the conservation park "Fuhneaue" in the south.

=== Geology===
Radegast is situated at the margin of the Köthen culture plain. Here it ascends from the Fuhne valley, so the difference in height is about 6 metres (20 ft) on a short distance. The town is situated right in the middle of a former impermeable stratum of agricultural use. It offers perfect conditions for cultivating sugar beets and wheat.

=== Neighbouring towns and villages ===

=== City structure ===
The town encloses the historical town centre and a housing estate formerly named "Siedlung Heimat", built in the early 30's.

== History ==
|thumb|The "Prinz von Anhalt", built in the year 1717, is one of Radegast's two historical guest houses.
|thumb|The other one, the "Weiße Ross" was first named in 1764.

The first written document mentioning "Frates de Radegiz" dates from the year 1244. In the following centuries, the ownership changed a few times, which was mentioned in some documents. In the year 1612, Radegast became a princely office. In 1727 the village received market and city rights from Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau, but the city rights were not exercised until 1852. From 1685 to 1688, a dam was built in the lowland of the river Fuhne between Radegast and Zörbig, which created an important trade-route between the cities of Magdeburg and Leipzig. In the year 1688 a boundary stone named the "Theure Christian" was set at this route. It marked the boundary between the former countries of Saxony and Anhalt-Dessau. In 1702 Radegast became a market-town, and in the same year the building of Radegast's first church began. The church-tower collapsed in 1752 and was rebuilt subsequently. Two historical guesthouses were built at that time; both of them exist today.
