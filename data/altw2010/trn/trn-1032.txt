'''Tomahawk''' is a city in Lincoln County, Town of Tomahawk and is not contiguous with it. There is also the Town of Lake Tomahawk in Oneida County.

==History==
The Chippewa people inhabited the Tomahawk area until treaty was signed that removed them to reservations. This removal allowed for widespread logging in the area.
Tomahawk was founded by William H. Bradley, who organized the Tomahawk Land and Boom Company in 1886. This company lumbered the area. The city was incorporated in 1891. The city exhibits a certain degree of affluence in some areas as there are a lot of upper middle class citizens that live on the many lakes, however there is also a large population of residents that are not which makes the per capita income relatively low.
