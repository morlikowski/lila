'''Groove metal''', often associated with '''neo-thrash'''/'''post-thrash''' and '''power groove''', is a term sometimes used to describe a derivative of thrash metal which took its current form during the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web

|quote = Groove metal is a derivative (but not necessarily a sub-genre) of thrash metal that rose to prominence in the early 90s. It is based around a mid-tempo thrash riff and detuned power chords. The band responsible for inventing the style is much disputed, but bands such as Exhorder, Pantera, Sepultura and Machine Head have all made substantial contributions in terms of developing and popularising the style.}}</ref> 

Albums such as Exhorder's ''Slaughter in the Vatican'' (1990), Pantera's ''Cowboys from Hell'' (1990),<ref>{{cite web

(1993), White Zombie's '' Overkill's ''Machine Head's ''Burn My Eyes'' (1994) that groove metal took its pure form.

==Musical traits==
Groove metal bands tend to play mid-tempo thrash riffs focusing on heaviness and groovy syncopation.<ref name="era" /><ref>{{cite web

|quote = Pantera practically revolutionized thrash metal. Speed wasn’t the main point anymore, it was what singer Phil Anselmo called the "power groove." Riffs became unusually heavy without the need of growling or the extremely low-tuned and distorted guitars of death metal, rhythms depended more on a heavy groove}}</ref> Guitarists generally play low syncopated power chord patterns and mid-paced guitar solos, and occasionally use heavy palm muting. The tone is typically described as thick and mid-scooped down with boosted bass and trebles, usually under a harsh distortion. Solid state amplifiers using transistors are commonly used to gain this asymmetrical harmonic clipping sound, although tube amps are used sometimes as well. Like most other heavy metal bass styles, groove metal bass lines typically follow the rhythm guitar riffs but are sometimes used as introduction to a guitar riff or as intermezzi when the guitar riffs are de-emphasized. The use of bass distortion is common. Vocals usually consist of thrash metal-styled shouts, hardcore-styled barks, and clean singing. Groove metal drums typically use double-bass drumming, with emphasis on using the double bass drum in waves, rather than rapid fire double bass and blast beats used in extreme metal styles.<ref>{{cite web

|quote = Compared to pure Thrash Metal the double bass playing plays a bigger role. In the middle of the Nineties this style saw its heyday and for many Metalheads it was the only true alternative to Grunge. Examples: PANTERA, PRONG, MACHINE HEAD.}}</ref> Uncommon time signatures and polyrhythms are typical for some bands; generally these bands put heavy emphasis on the changing beat. Groove metal typically follows in a medium tempo,<ref name="era" /> but can vary from band to band or song to song.
