'''Motorcykel''' är ett motorfordon med två, tre eller fyra hjul . Den militära förkortningen '''mc''' (små bokstäver) har kommit till användning i de flesta sammanhang - mc-förare, mc-tävlingar etc.

==Klassning av mc==
I Sverige finns det två klasser och de kräver olika typer av körkort. 
#Lätt motorcykel, vars motor har en slagvolym av högst 125 cm&sup3; och en effekt av högst 11 kW (cirka 14,9 hk).
#Tung motorcykel &ndash; dessa är genom körkortet indelade i två underklasser:
## motorcykel vars motoreffekt understiger 25 kW samt vars förhållande mellan effekt och vikt ej överstiger 0,16.
## motorcykel med obegränsad motoreffekt och vikt/effekt-förhållande.

==Körkortskrav==
I Sverige finns tre behörighetsklasser av körkort för motorcykel:
#A1 &ndash; lätt motorcykel,	körkortsålder 16 år.
#A begränsad,	körkortsålder 18 år. Gäller tung motorcykel 1 enligt ovan (mellanklass). Den som har ett begränsat A-kort får automatiskt obegränsat A-kort efter två år.
#A  &ndash; alla typer av motorcyklar,	körkortsålder 21 år.

==Skyddsutrustning==
right|200px|thumb|Skyddsutrustning vid motorcykelkörning'''
Vanligtvis används speciella kläder som skyddar mot väder och vind samt inte minst viktigt som mekaniskt skydd vid eventuell olycka. 
I motorcykelns barndom användes ofta stora skinnjackor som - för att minska köldeffekten av fartvinden - fodrades med dagstidningar. Kraftiga läderstövlar var också vanligt, till skillnad mot skinnbyxor som inte slog igenom förrän på 1950-talet.

De så kallade  skinnställen har under 1990-talet alltmer kommit att ersättas av kläder av textilmaterial, som då de oftast är kombinerade med membran bättre står mot regn och vind. Såväl textilkläder som skinnkläder har mycket varierande kvalitet men de bästa textilplaggen anses vara lika tåliga mot nötning vid till exempel omkullkörning på asfalt som välgjorda skinnkläder.
Skinnställ, overaller, har oftast inlägg av stretch i kevlar i till exempel armveck och knäveck för att göra plagget mer komfortabelt. 
Membran är ett foderskikt som oftast är frihängande (s.k. z-liner) men kan även vara laminerat mot yttertyget. Membranet  släpper inte igenom vatten p.g.a. vattnets ytspänning upp till för respektive fabrikat angivna trycknivåer men släpper ut fukt från insidan (ånga), så att stället kan "andas". Membran finns även i kombination med skinn men kombinationen skinn/membran har nackdelen att inte skydda skinnet mot vätans kraftiga reduktion av rivtåligheten hos blött skinn då membranet sitter under skinnet.

De flesta skyddskläder har extra förstärkningar på knä, höfter, armbågar och axlar. Om ordet skydd förekommer måste detta vara CE-godkänt, andra förstärkningar måste kallas för annat än skydd ex.vis ilägg. Ett ofta förekommande förstärkningsmaterial är Kevlar. Det är allt vanligare med ryggskydd för att förhindra ryggskador.
Hjälm är obligatoriskt krav enligt lag.

==Olika typer av motorcyklar==
*''Sporthoj'' kallas normalt en motorcykel utvecklade med stil och prestanda som anknyter till tävlingsmotorcyklar för roadracing.
*''Glidare'' är motorcyklar designade efter Harley-Davidsons koncept med avspänd körställning och lugn körning. Kallas även ''Custom''.
*''Touringmaskiner'' är motorcyklar designade för bekväma långturer med väl skyddad förare.
*''Tävlingsmaskiner'' för trial, speedway, supermotard och roadracing.

*''Modifierade'' tex chopper, bobber eller caféracer.

A '''motorcycle''' or '''motorbike''' is a single-track, two-wheeled long distance travel, navigating congested urban traffic, cruising, sport and racing, or off-road conditions. In many parts of the world, motorcycles are among the least expensive and most widespread forms of motorised transport.

==History==

Arguably, the first motorcycle was designed and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt (since 1905 a city district of Stuttgart) in 1885.<ref name="The Past - 1800s: First motorcycle"></ref> 
The first petroleum-powered vehicle, it was essentially a motorised bicycle, although the inventors called their invention the Reitwagen ("riding car"). 
However, if a two-wheeled vehicle with steam propulsion is considered a motorcycle, then the first one may have been American. One such machine was demonstrated at fairs and circuses in the eastern U.S. in 1867, built by Sylvester Howard Roper of Roxbury, Massachusetts.<ref name="The Past - 1800s: First motorcycle"/>

In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first motorcycle available for purchase.<ref name="Brief History of the Marque: Hildebrand & Wolfmuller"></ref> 
In the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of bicycles adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the number of motorcycle producers increased.

Until the Indian, producing over 20,000 bikes per year. By 1920, this honour went to Harley-Davidson, with their motorcycles being sold by dealers in 67 countries. In 1928, DKW took over as the largest manufacturer. 

After the BSA Group became the largest producer of motorcycles in the world, producing up to 75,000 bikes per year in the 1950s. The German company NSU Motorenwerke AG held the position of largest manufacturer from 1955 until the 1970s.

In the 1950s, streamlining began to play an increasing part in the development of racing motorcycles and held out the possibility of radical changes to motorcycle design. NSU and Moto-Guzzi were in the vanguard of this development both producing very radical designs well ahead of their time.<ref></ref> NSU produced the most advanced design, but because of the deaths of four NSU riders in the 1954&ndash;1956 seasons, they abandoned further development and quit Grand Prix motorcycle racing.<ref></ref> Moto-Guzzi produced competitive race machines, and by 1957 nearly all the Grand Prix races were being won by streamlined machines.   

From the 1960s through the 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide, partly as a result of East German Walter Kaaden's engine work in the 1950s.<ref name="Motocross goes International, 1947 through 1965"></ref>

Today, the Japanese manufacturers, Kawasaki, Yamaha dominate the motorcycle industry, although BMW, Triumph, Aprilia, Moto-Guzzi, MV Agusta and Ducati. 

Outside of the U.S., these brands have enjoyed continued and sustained success, although Triumph, for example, has been re-incarnated from its former self into a modern world-class manufacturer. In overall numbers, however, the Chinese currently manufacture and sell more motorcycles than any other country and exports are rising.

Additionally, the small-capacity scooter is very popular through most of the world.  The Piaggio group of Italy, for example, is one of the world's largest producers of two-wheeled vehicles.

==Technical aspects==

===Construction===

Motorcycle construction is the engineering, manufacturing, and assembly of components and systems for a motorcycle which results in performance, cost and aesthetics desired by the designer. With some exceptions, construction of modern mass-produced motorcycles has standardised on a frame, telescopic forks holding the front wheel, and engine consisting of between 1 and 8 cylinders coupled to a manual five- or six-speed sequential transmission drives the belt.

===Fuel economy===
<!-- Deleted image removed: thumb|[[India|Indian Bajaj Pulsar gives a mileage of 42.4 km/l on highways.<ref>[http://www.bajajauto.com/pulsar/index.htm Pulsar DTS-i󰀄]</ref>]] -->
Motorcycle fuel economy benefits from the relatively small mass of the vehicle. This, of course, relates to how the motorcycle is used. One person on a small motorcycle travelling a short distance is generally very economical. However a large motorcycle generally has bad aerodynamics compared with a typical car, poor aerodynamics of exposed passengers and engines designed for goals other than fuel economy can work to reduce these benefits. Riding style has a large effect on fuel economy.

Fuel economy varies greatly with engine displacement and riding style ranging from a low of  reported by a Honda VTR1000F rider,<ref name="Total Motorcycle Fuel Economy Guide"></ref> 
to  reported for the Verucci Nitro 50&nbsp;cc Scooter.<ref name="Verucci Gas Scooters"></ref> 
A specially designed Matzu Matsuzawa Honda XL125 achieved  "on real highways - in real conditions."<ref name="Doing More with Less Energy"></ref>

===Fueling===

Fueling a motorcycle can be difficult because many of today's fueling nozzles are designed specifically for automobile and truck fueling.  Motorcycles frequently have smaller fuel tanks with capacities between 2 gallons and up to 6 gallons on some models.
Many motorcyclists can easily overflow or spill fuel during fueling because the filler necks are exposed and an inefficient seal is formed.
Additionally, many of today's fuel nozzles are equipped with automatic shut off sensors which tend to over respond and cause a constant clicking off effect when filling a motorcycle.

In the United States the EPA has mandated the use of "Vapor Recovery" nozzles which augment the problem of fueling in that these nozzles tend to have a black accordion-like covering on the outside of the nozzle.  This requires the covering to be held back manually with one hand to override the auto shut-off system allowing for a constant uninterrupted flow of fuel into the tank.

===Dynamics===
thumb|[[Superbike racing|Racing motorcycles leaning in a turn.]]

Motorcycles must be leaned in order to turn. This lean can be induced by a method known as countersteering, in which the rider turns the handlebars in the direction opposite of the desired direction of turn. In other words, press forward on the handgrip in the desired direction&mdash;press right to go right, press left to go left. This concept is counter-intuitive and often very confusing to novices&mdash;and even to many experienced motorcyclists.<ref name="Steering in bicycles and motorcycles"></ref>

Short wheelbase motorcycles, such as sport bikes, can generate enough torque at the rear wheel and enough stopping force at the front wheel to lift the other wheel off the pavement. These actions, if performed on purpose, are known as wheelies and stoppies respectively. If carried past the point of recovery the resulting upset is known as "looping" the vehicle.

Different types of motorcycles have different dynamics and play a role in how a motorcycle performs in given conditions. For example, a shorter wheelbase would generally make a bike lean faster and would be quicker around corners compared to a longer wheelbase. Longer wheelbase on the other hand provides more stability in a straight line.

===Additions===
Various additions may be attached to a motorcycle or come as an integral part of a motorcycle from the factory.

thumb| Fairing on a [[Honda Goldwing|Honda Gold Wing]]
;Fairing
A fairing", is placed over the frame on some models to shield the rider from the wind, aid in Drag is the major factor that limits motorcycle speed. As evident in the streamlined appearance of new performance motorcycles, there is much aerodynamic technology included in the design. Since the 1958 FIM ban on motorcycle designs that cover the wheels or the rider, e.g., "dustbin" fairings, no major manufacturer has provided fairing to overcome the effect of the turbulence caused by the spinning front wheel, which prevents the motorcycle from cutting a clean path through the air. "Dustbin" fairings can improve aerodynamic performance without substantially compromising the rider's ability to control the machine, if the fairing is designed and tested for the effects of side winds. 

Modern fairings on touring and sport-touring motorcycles dramatically improve a rider's comfort and attention on long rides by reducing the effect of the wind and rain on the body. They also help keep a rider warm in cold weather or high wind chill conditions, reducing hypothermia.

thumb|left|An example of a fairing on a Honda CBR1000F
;Windscreen
Also called acrylic plastic. They may be shaped specifically to direct air flow over or around the head of the rider even if they are much shorter than the seated rider. Some motorcycles have electric screens, introduced on the 1986 BMW K100LT, which raise and lower the screen with the push of a button to the optimum height for conditions.

In the absence of a fairing or screen, a phenomenon known as the ''windsock effect'' occurs at speeds above , where the rider becomes a major source of drag and is pushed back from the handlebars, tiring the rider. However, these motorcycles still effectively push their way through the atmosphere with brute force. A cabin cycle, which has a hull that wraps around the basic cycle frame, solved the problem of aerodynamics by isolating driver from outside air.

thumb|Craven's ''Golden Arrow'' panniers
;Saddlebags or panniers
ABS, leather, Cordura, or other appropriate sturdy material. They are normally standard items on touring motorcycles but are usually optional on other types of motorcycles. They can be model-specific and available from a motorcycle's manufacturer, or after-market and designed to fit on numerous models.

thumb|left|Heated handgrips on a BMW
;Heated hand grips/seats
Since motorcycles lack climate control or proper protection from the wind, some manufacturers offer heated seats or hand grips to relieve the discomfort of low temperatures experienced during night riding or the colder months. They can also be added on as after-market accessories and are powered by the bike's electrical system.

;Luggage rack
A common addition to many bikes is an attachment onto which bags or other luggage can be fastened. This removes the need for rider backpacks and is generally a more secure and safe way to add carrying capacity to a motorcycle.

;Sidecar
thumb|[[IMZ-Ural motorcycle with sidecar]]
A sidecar is a one-wheeled device attached to the side of a motorcycle, producing a three-wheeled vehicle. Early sidecars were removable devices that could be detached from the motorcycle. Sidecars gradually superseded forecars and trailers. The forecar comprised a two-wheeled attachment at the front of the motorcycle. The trailer was just that, pulling the passenger along behind. In neither case could rider and passenger converse easily, and early sidecars were often called 'sociable' attachments.

;Trailer hitch
A trailer hitch or tow hitch is a device mounted on a motorcycle that enables it to tow a motorcycle trailer, usually to haul additional gear. No motorcycle manufacturer recommends trailer towing because it creates safety hazards for motorcyclists.

;Trunk
A motorcycle trunk is a storage compartment in the vicinity of the seat, other than panniers or saddlebags. A trunk mounted above and at the rear of the seat is called a top box.

==Social aspects==

===Subcultures===
thumb|A motorcycle rally in Ontario
Around the world, motorcycles have historically been associated with Mods and Rockers of the 1960s. A few are believed to be criminal gangs.

Social motorcyclist organisations are popular and are sometimes organised geographically, focus on individual makes, or even specific models. Example motorcycle clubs include: Moto Guzzi National Owners Club, Gold Wing Road Riders (GWRRA), and BMW MOA. 

Many motorcycle organisations raise money for motorcycle rallies in different parts of the world that are attended by many thousands of riders.

Some other motorcycle organisations exist only for the direct benefit of others. Bikers Against Child Abuse (BACA) is one example. BACA assigns members to individual children to help them through difficult situations, or even stay with the child if the child is alone or frightened.<ref name="BACA Website"></ref>

In recent decades, motorcyclists have formed political lobbying organisations in order to influence legislators to introduce motorcycle-friendly legislation.  One of the oldest such organisations, the British Motorcycle Action Group, was founded in 1973 specifically in response to helmet compulsion, introduced without public consultation.<ref name="MAG"></ref> In addition, the British Motorcyclists Federation (BMF), originally founded in 1960 as a reaction to the public perception of motorcyclists as leather-jacketed hooligans, has itself moved into political lobbying.  

Likewise, the U.S. has ABATE, which, like most such organisations, also works to improve motorcycle safety, as well as running the usual charity fund-raising events and rallies, often for motorcycle-related political interests.<ref>Some other lobbying organisations are listed in :Category:Motorcyclists organizations.</ref>
