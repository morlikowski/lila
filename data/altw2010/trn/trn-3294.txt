'''ガブリエル・デストレ'''（Gabrielle d'Estrees, アンリ4世の愛妾。ブールデジエール城（現在のアンドル＝エ＝ロワール県にあった）で、クーヴル侯アントワーヌの娘として生まれた。

ガブリエルは21歳でアンリの愛妾となった。アンリはカトリック同盟と苦闘している最中だった。彼はマルグリット・ド・ヴァロワと正式に結婚していたが、アンリとガブリエルは愛し合っていることを人目もはばからず隠そうともしなかった。ガブリエルはアンリの遠征に同行した。臨月の体でも戦場近くの王のテントそばに野営し、彼の世話を焼いた。彼女は知的で現実的な女性で、王はしばしば彼女に意見を求めた。

カトリック教徒のガブリエルは、この内戦に勝つにはアンリ自身がカトリックに改宗すべきだと考えていた。1593年7月25日、アンリは正式にカトリックに改宗し、1594年に戴冠式を行った。その礼にガブリエルの夫との結婚を無効にしてやり、ガブリエルはモンスー伯爵夫人の称号を得た。

ガブリエルはアンリの最も有能な外交官で、カトリック同盟内の多くの女の友人らを起用して平和に貢献した。彼女はアンリとともに馬にまたがって猟や遠乗りをするのが好きで、よくパリ郊外へ出かけていた。およそ7年の間、ガブリエルはアンリの事実上の妻であり、彼に3人の子供を生んだため、1597年にボーフォール公の称号を授かった。

1599年、アンリはガブリエルとの再婚を考え、教皇庁にマルグリットとの結婚の無効を申請した。「神様か、王様の死亡以外に、私の幸運を断ち切れるものはない。」と豪語していたガブリエルは、突如として重病にかかり、4月初めに男児を死産した。ガブリエル重態の知らせは、フォンテーヌブロー宮殿にいた王のもとへ届けられた。その翌日、1599年4月10日、アンリは愛妾の元へ向かう途上に訃報を知らされた。

'''Gabrielle d'Estrées, duchesse de Beaufort et Verneuil, marquise de Monceaux''' (French mistress of King département'' of France.

== Mistress to a King ==
Gabrielle d'Estrées became Henri's companion and lover at the age of twenty in Catholic League.  Although he was married to Marguerite de Valois, Henri and Gabrielle were openly affectionate with each other in public. Fiercely loyal, Gabrielle accompanied Henri during his campaigns. Even when heavily pregnant, she insisted on living inside his tent near the battlefield, making sure his clothing was clean and that he ate well after a battle, handling the day to day correspondence while he fought. An intelligent and practical woman, Henri confided his secrets in her and followed her advice. When the two were apart, they wrote each other frequent letters. 

Born a Catholic, Gabrielle realized the best way to conclude the religious wars was for Henri himself to become a Catholic. Recognizing the wisdom in her argument, on 25 July 1593 Henri declared that "Paris is well worth a Mass" and permanently renounced Protestantism. This enabled him to be crowned King of France on February 27, 1594. As a reward, Henri arranged for her marriage to M. de Liancourt to be annulled, and gave her the titles of Marquise de Monceaux and Titular Mistress of the King of France. 

News of the relationship between Henri and Gabrielle did not sit well with some members of the Parisian elite, and malicious pamphlets circulated that blamed the new duchess for many national misfortunes.  One of the most vicious nicknames ascribed to Gabrielle was ''la duchesse d'Ordure'' ("the Duchess of Filth").<ref>Bercé, Yves-Marie, 5</ref> 

In the succeeding years, Gabrielle became Henri's most important diplomat, using her female friends amongst the various Catholic League families to bring about peace. In March 1596, Henri gave both Gabrielle and his saintly sister Catherine a set of gold keys which bestowed upon them seats on his council. This gift pleased Gabrielle so much that she took to wearing the little keys on a chain around her neck.

Avid horseback riders, she and Henri enjoyed hunting and riding in the countryside around Paris. For seven years, she had the role of a wife and gave the King three children he willingly acknowledged, and  Henri gave her the Duchy of Beaufort in 1597.

Shortly afterward, in 1598, Henri issued the Edict of Nantes, which gave the Huguenots certain rights while deferring to Catholics. Joining forces, the Huguenot Catherine and Catholic Gabrielle went to work overriding the objections of powerful Catholics and Huguenots and forcing compliance with the edict. Henri was so impressed with her efforts that he wrote "My mistress has become an orator of unequaled brilliance, so fiercely does she argue the cause of the new Edict."
== Death ==

After applying to Pope Clement VIII for an annulment of his marriage and authority to remarry, in March of 1599 Henri gave his mistress his coronation ring. Gabrielle, so sure that the wedding would take place, stated, "Only God or the king's death could put an end to my good luck".

Perhaps she tempted fate too much. A few days later, in early April, she suffered an attack of eclampsia and gave birth to a stillborn son.  King Henri was at the Royal Château de Fontainebleau when news arrived of her illness.  The next day, April 10, 1599, while Henri was on his way to her, she died in Paris after the miscarriage.<ref>Bercé, Yves-Marie, 6</ref>

The king was grief-stricken, especially given the widely-held rumor that Gabrielle had been poisoned. He wore black in mourning, something no previous French monarch had done before. He gave her the funeral of a Queen; her coffin was transported amidst a procession of princes, princesses, and nobles to the Île-de-France).
