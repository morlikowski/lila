'''Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Alaiddin Sulaiman Shah''' (13 Mei 1898 â€“ 1 September 1960) merupakan Yang di-Pertuan Agong kedua yang bertahta dari 1 April sampai 1 September 1960, dan Sultan Selangor yang ke-5.

Al-Marhum Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah merupakan putera sulung Sultan Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah ibni Almarhum Raja Muda Musa (1898-1938) dengan Cik Puan Hasnah binti Pilong, isteri orang kebanyakan. Diberi nama Tengku Alam Shah, ia tidak direncanakan untuk memerintah disebabkan ia mempunyai dua orang kakak.

Menerima pendidikan di Maktab Melayu Kuala Kangsar (MCKK), Tengku Alam Shah telah dilantik sebagai Sultan pada tahun 1938 setelah kemangkatan ayahandanya. Bagaimanapun, pada tahun 1942 sampai 1945, ketika Jepang memerintah Malaysia, ia diturunkan dari tahta dan digantikan dengan saudara tiri tertuanya yang dilantik dengan gelar Sultan Musa Ghiatuddin Riayat Shah. Dengan kembalinya pihak Britania Raya, Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah dikembalikan ke tahta, sementara bekas Sultan Musa dibuang ke daerah Kepulauan Cocos Keeling.

In full, '''Almarhum Sultan Sir Hisamuddin Alam Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Sir Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah''', KCMG (May 13, 1898 - September 1, 1960) was the second Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia from April 14 to September 1, 1960, and fifth Sultan of Selangor between 1938-1942 and again from 1945-1960.  

===Early career===
He was the first son of Almarhum Sultan Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah ibni Almarhum Raja Muda Musa (1893-1938) by Cik Puan Hasnah binti Pilong, a commoner wife. Named Tengku Alam Shah at birth, he was not expected to succeed as he had two elder half-brothers. 

Educated at the Malay College Kuala Kangsar, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Malay College Old Boys Association(MCOBA) in 1929.  In 1931, he was appointed Tengku Laksamana of Selangor, having previously served as Tengku Panglima Raja.

===The Selangor Succession Dispute===
Sultan Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah had many children, his first three sons in chronological order being Tengku Musa Eddin, Tengku Badar Shah and Tengku Alam Shah. The first two sons were children by his royal consort, Tengku Ampuan Maharum binti Tengku Dhiauddin of the royal house of Kedah.  In 1903, Tunku Musa Eddin had been made ''Tengku Mahkota'' and was promoted to ''Raja Muda'' or heir apparent in 1920. <ref> Buyong Adil 1971 ''Sejarah Selangor'' DBP </ref>

However, at the instigation of the British Resident,  Theodore Samuel Adams (b. 1885 - d. 1961; in office 1935 - 1937), Tengku Musa Eddin was dismissed as ''Raja Muda'' in 1934 for alleged "misbehaviour". Adams had accused Tengku Musa Eddin as a spendthrift and wastrel with a penchant for gambling.  However, many Malays in Selangor believed the real reason for Tengku Musa Eddin's dismissal was his refusal to follow Adam's orders. <ref> Buyong Adil ''op cit'' </ref> 

Although Sultan Sulaiman pleaded for the case of Tengku Musa Eddin (even petitioning the Secretary of State for the Colonies and discussing the issue directly with him in London), Tengku Alam Shah was instead proclaimed ''Raja Muda'' or heir to the throne over the head of his other half-brother Tengku Badar.<ref> Willan, HC (October 7, 1945) Interview with the Malay Rulers CAB 101/69, CAB/HIST/B/4/7 </ref>   The appointment occurred on July 20, 1936.<ref> Buyong Adil ''op cit'' </ref>

===First Reign===
Tengku Alam Shah was proclaimed Sultan on April 4, 1938 four days after the death of his father. On January 26, 1939, he was crowned at Istana Mahkota Puri in Klang.  Tengku Musa Eddin, then Tengku Kelana Jaya Putera, presided over the ceremony. <ref> Buyong Adil ''op cit'' </ref>

===Japanese Occupation===
On January 15, 1942, Colonel Fujiyama, the Japanese Military Governor of Selangor,  invited Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah to King's House in Kuala Lumpur.  In an interview with Major-General Minaki the Sultan confessed that he had made speeches in support of the British war efforts but had been persuaded by the British resident to do so.  After being told to surrender the regalia to his older brother, the Japanese removed Sultan Alam Shah and in November 1943, proclaimed Tengku Musa Eddin as the new Sultan Musa Ghiatuddin Riayat Shah of Selangor.<ref> Willan, HC (October 7, 1945) Interview with the Malay Rulers CAB 101/69, CAB/HIST/B/4/7 </ref>  

Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah declined to work with the Japanese and from 1943, refused their allowance awarded to him and his children.<ref> ''ibid'' </ref>

===Second Reign=== 
The return of the British finally brought Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah back to the throne, while ex-Sultan Musa was exiled to the Cocos Keeling Islands.<ref> Buyong Adil ''op cit'' </ref>

Although he had signed the Malayan Union treaty, like all other Malay rulers, he later repudiated it and gave open support to Malay nationalist effort to overthrow the plan.  On March 1, 1946 Sultan Alam Shah officiated the First Malay Unity Congress at the Sultan Sulaiman Club in Kuala Lumpur which was instrumental in creating UMNO.  The Congress was organised by the Selangor Malay Society (PMS) which had as its president the scholar Zainal Abidin bin Ahmad (Za'ba), a critic of British colonial rule.
