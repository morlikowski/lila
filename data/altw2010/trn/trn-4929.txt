'''Toni Basil''' (born '''Antonia Christina Basilotta'''; American video actress and choreographer.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Basil was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her mother was a vaudevillian and her father was an orchestra leader.<ref>[http://www.tonibasil.net/biography/index.html Toni Basil - The Authorized Site: Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Music career===
Toni Basil appeared in the 1964 concert film, 1966 with a rare one-off single for 76, it wasn't until 1982 that she released a follow-up, the international smash "Mickey". This song is, in fact, a cover of "Kitty", a UK band Mike Chapman. (The original is sung by a man to a girl named Kitty, while Basil sings about a guy named Mickey.) Furthermore, "Mickey" was actually recorded in 1979, and when her record label wanted to release the song in 1982, Basil was reluctant, believing the song already sounded "dated". But the label persevered, and pop-music history was made.

The music video for "Mickey" was one of the most popular of the early MTV videos. In the video, Basil wore her head cheerleader uniform from Las Vegas High School, the school from which she graduated (though the year on the uniform, 81, was two decades after her actual grad year).<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuRgkvSkRo YouTube - Broadcast Yourself<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She has a special fondness for the song today and its enduring popularity. Basil has said on more than one occasion that she would gladly put on the cheerleader uniform she wore in the video again if she was asked to.  In 2003, VH1 ranked "Mickey" Number 5 on its list of the 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders.<ref>http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/the_greatest/one_hit_wonders/list_20-1.jhtml</ref>

Basil's '80s recording career consisted of only two albums: 1982's ''Word of Mouth'' (which spawned a second Hot 100 single with "Shoppin' from A to Z") and 1983's ''Toni Basil'' (which yielded Basil's third and final Hot 100 chart single "Over My Head"). Later in the 1980s, "Girls Night Out" made an appearance on the soundtrack to the 1986 film ''Modern Girls''. To date, there have been no fewer than five Toni Basil best-of collections released on CD. In 1999, DJ and Producer Jason Nevins' dance remix of "Mickey" was a big night club hit in Europe and Australia.

===Choreographer===
Basil is a prolific choreographer who began as assistant choreographer on David Byrne's memorable, Once in a Lifetime". She worked with Talking Heads again to direct and choreograph the music video for the song "Crosseyed and Painless". She also choreographed thumb|right|UK single artwork for Toni Basil's [[1982 hit song "Mickey"]]  Her expertise as a choreographer led her to be invited to sit as a judge in season four of Fox Television's So You Think You Can Dance.

Her film choreography work includes Pajama Party (1964) , Head, in which she makes an appearance as a dancer during ''Daddy's Song'' with Davy Jones.

===Acting career===
Basil has appeared in the movies ''The Rose'', ''AIP, as well as the The Monkees' cult film ''Head'' (in which she appeared as the (unbilled) dancer in the "Daddy's Song" sequence).  In addition to her appearance in ''Head'', she appeared in ''Robert Downey's ''Greaser's Palace'' (1970) as a Native American maiden was limited to an extended topless horseride across the desert plains.
