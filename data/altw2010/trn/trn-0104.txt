'''Great Northern Highway''' is a generally north-south Perth with its most northern port, Wyndham. It is  in length, with  being National Highway. It is constructed as a sealed, predominantly 2-lane single carriageway (excluding a number of single lane bridges in the Kimberley).

This highway is the longest intrastate highway in Australia and also the longest Australian highway in absolute terms. In parts, it is among the remotest sealed roads in the world. Some sections are several hundred kilometres in length without so much as a Kimberley. In these areas, the key industries of mining, pastoral stations and tourism are all dependent on the highway.

==History==

Prior to the 1960s, with the exception of several better quality sections in the wheatbelt area, Great Northern Highway was mostly a series of tracks linking Perth to remote pastoral areas. However, several events occurred in the 1950s that moved the highway forwards. The federal government Kimberley, which meant trucks were able to transport cattle to port, as against the historical but slow cattle droves. In the Kimberley, a sealed single lane link between Broome and Derby was completed in the 1960s, as were a number of access roads to the port of Wyndham.

Meanwhile, iron ore was discovered in the Meekatharra and Newman opened in 1978, having been upgraded and sealed to two lanes wide. Also in 1978, the road between Halls Creek and Wyndham was upgraded and sealed to two lanes wide, and was followed not long after in 1981 by the widened and sealed 476 km between Port Hedland and Broome.

Work accelerated in the 1980s as part of the Fitzroy Crossing and Halls Creek was opened after 5 years of work. This marked the completion of sealing the Highway 1 route around Australia, a route which included the already completed Perth and Port Hedland. Between Newman and Port Hedland the Great Northern Highway was changed in the 1980s to a new route running to the west of the original. It had previously passed through Nullagine and Marble Bar. The new Newman-Port Hedland link was finished in 1989. This marked the completion of sealing the Great Northern Highway (the inland route), and also completion of the federally funded National Highway around Australia.

==Tourism==
The section of highway immediately north of Perth runs along the eastern Swan Valley, which attracts large numbers of visitors to its numerous wineries, microbreweries and restaurants. Further north are the gorges and related areas around Karijini National Park and the inland Pilbara mines, which are of interest to some, but the alternative North West Coastal Highway between Perth and Port Hedland offers access to the Indian Ocean and its many natural attractions and is hence favoured by tourists.

In the Kimberley, the highway provides access to many off-highway natural attractions such as Purnululu National Park (the Bungle Bungles), Wolfe Creek Crater, the Broome, as well as being the part of the route into and out of the Northern Territory. Best seen between April and October when the weather is cooler, these attractions draw in local, interstate and overseas tourists, of which a large number use four wheel drives towing caravans.

==Hazards==

The Great Northern Highway presents several major hazards to travellers, both seasoned and new. Stray cattle and other grazing animals are particularly dangerous and prevalent in the Kimberley and roo bar and driving spotlights can help slightly, but is still very dangerous.

De '''Great Northern Highway''' is een van de belangrijkste wegen in Perth, met de noordelijkste havenstad Kimberley is het grootste gedeelte uitgevoerd als een tweebaansweg.

Deze weg is de langste highway in Australië en is op sommige delen de meest afgelegen geasfalteerde weg ter wereld. In de weg bevinden zich secties van honderden kilometers waarlangs zelfs niet eens een roadhouse te vinden is. In economisch opzicht is het de toegangsweg tot de grondstofrijke gebieden zoals de regio's Pilbara en Kimberley. In deze gebieden zijn industrieën, landbouw en toerisme grotendeels van deze weg afhankelijk.
