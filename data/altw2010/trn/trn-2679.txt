The '''Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan''' were created according to the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan of 9 October 1991.<ref>[http://www.president.az  official web page of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan]</ref> The equipment and facilities of the Soviet Fourth Army provided the main material source in first period. 

The Armed Forces have three branches: Land Forces, Air Force and Air Defence Force (a united branch) and the Navy. Besides the Armed Forces there are some additional forces, which are militarily organised and can be involved in state defence when needed. Those are the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and forces of the State Border Service, which includes Coastal Guard as well.<ref>[http://www.mia.gov.az official web page of the Ministry of Internal Affairs]</ref>.

The current Defence Minister is Chief of Staff is colonel-general Najmaddin Sadykhov. 

In July 1992, Azerbaijan ratified the nuclear weapons state. Azerbaijan participates in Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Moldova regional co-operation group", known as GUAM. 

In 2006 under presidential decree the Azerbaijan Defense Industry was established. The Azerbaijani defense industry is endowed with between $60-70&nbsp;million in state funding, but is planned to be funded at least $600&nbsp;million for 2007. The defense industry has emerged as an autonomous entity with a growing defense production capability. The new ministry is cooperating with the defense sectors of Turkey, Ukraine, Pakistan and the U.S.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/02/2b0bdd2d-49a6-4bff-826d-05edefe4dbdb.html Azerbaijan Defense Industry]</ref>

==Overview==
<!-- Deleted image removed: thumb|Special Forces troops train in unarmed combat. -->
In light of recent oil boom within the nation and the completion of the US-backed Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, Azerbaijan increased its armed forces budget to $300&nbsp;million dollars in 2005, a 110% increase from the previous year. In 2006 the military budget of Azerbaijan was raised to $638&nbsp;million and approximately $224&nbsp;million was slated to be spent on new weapons and equipment. In May 2006 the military budget was again raised to $660&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://today.az/news/business/26581.html Military budget reaches $660&nbsp;million]</ref>. A few months later the budget was again raised to $700&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.525ci.com/2006/06/24/read.php?m=1&id=26385 Military budget reaches $700&nbsp;million]</ref> On 17 October 2006 the defense minister announced that the military budget of Azerbaijan had reached 796.8412&nbsp;million ANZ (approximately US$900&nbsp;million), in November 2007 the  military budget reached AZN 1,3&nbsp;billion  (US$1.5&nbsp;billion).<ref>[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=39938 Azerbaijan military budget reaches $1,5&nbsp;billion in 2007]</ref> In April, 2008, the President of Azerbaijan announced the 52% rise in military spending, totaling the military budget to over $2&nbsp;billion USD.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL1597375 Military budget reaches $2&nbsp;billion]</ref> 

Azerbaijan is modernizing and expanding its army to prepare for a worst case scenario. Many believe this rise in military expenditure followed the Azeri announcement that the army would be willing to capture the estimated 16% of its occupied territories (the number comes down to 9% if the territory of Nagorno Karabakh is excluded), which are currently under the control of Armenia which fought against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh war during the early 1990s. In 2006 Azerbaijani president also ordered to increase the wages of Azerbaijan military personnel by 100%.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060623/wl_afp/azerbaijanarmenia Military personnel wages increased by 100%]</ref> 

Troops from Azerbaijan serve as peacekeepers in NATO-led operations in Turkmen populations, religious sites and convoys.

== History of Azerbaijan army ==

The history of the modern Azerbaijan army dates back to Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918, when the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan Republic were created in June 26, 1918. First de facto Minister of Defense of ADR was Dr. Khosrov bey Sultanov. When the Ministry was formally established Gen. Samedbey Mehmandarov became the minister, and then Lt-Gen. Ali-Agha Shikhlinski his deputy. Chiefs of Staff of ADR Army were Lt-Gen. Mamedbey Sulkevich (March 1919 - 10 Dec 1919) and Maj-Gen. Abdulhamid bey Gaitabashi (10 Dec 1919 – April 1920).

In summer 1992, the Defense Ministry of Azerbaijan, following a resolution by the Azerbaijani president on the privatization of units and formations in Azerbaijani territory, forwarded an ultimatum demanding control over vehicles and armaments of the 135th and 139th motorized rifle regiments of the 295th Motor Rifle Division.<ref>Vladimir Petrov, [http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/4-2002/dp/hscwa/?form=print How South Caucasus was armed], Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (Moscow, Russia)</ref>
Azerbaijan had been the deployment area of units of the 4th Army that consisted of four motorized rifle divisions (23rd, 60th, 296th and 75th) and prescribed army units that included missile and air defense brigades and artillery and rocket regiments. It also hosted the 49th arsenal of the Main Agency of Missiles and Artillery of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, which contained over 7,000 train-car loads of ammunition to the excess of one billion units. The transfer of the property of the 4th Army (except for part of the property of the 366th motorized rifle regiment of the 23rd division captured by Armenian armed formations in 1992 during the regiment's withdrawal from Stepanakert) and the 49th arsenal was completed in 1992. Thus, by the end of 1992, Azerbaijan received arms and military hardware sufficient for approximately four motorized rifle divisions with prescribed army units. It also inherited 50 combat aircraft from the disbanded 19th Air Defense Army and naval ships.

When Azerbaijan re-established its independence in 1991, it immediately started the formation of national military forces. Lt-Gen. Valekh Barshadli became the first minister of defense (September-December 1991, from May to October 1992 he served as Chief of Staff). Other ministers of defense from 1992 until 1995 included: Maj. Gen. Tajaddin Mekhdiyev (December 1991 - January 1992), Colonel Shahin Musayev (January-February 1992), Police Colonel Tahir Aliyev (February-March 1992), Raghim Gaziyev (March 1992-February 1993), Maj. Gen. Dadash Rzayev (February-June 1993), Colonel Safar Abiyev (June-August 1993), Maj.-Gen. Vahid Musayev (August-September 1993), and Maj. Gen. Mamedrafi Mamedov (September 1993 - February 1995). Chief military advisors to the President of Azerbaijan included: Turkish Air Force Brig. Gen. Yasar Demirbulak (1992-1994), Maj. Gen. Nureddin Sadykhov (1993-1999), Col. Gen. Tofig Aghahuseynov (1997-2002) and National Security Lt. Gen. Vahid Aliyev (since April 2002).

Azerbaijan army took a series of devastating defeats by Armenian forces of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh in 1992–1994 Nagorno-Karabakh war, which resulted in loss of Nagorno-Karabakh itself and about 20% of territory of Soviet Azerbaijan. Most of Azeri sources insist that solely the help of Russia and the rich Armenian diaspora made Armenian victories possible, however, Armenians deny that allegation, claiming that Russian side was helping Armenians and Azerbaijanis equally, supplying weapons and mercenaries. The Azeris had on their turn the massive aid from Turkey (economically and militarily); Ukrainian mercenaries and Chechen warriors on Azerbaijan's side weren't uncommon as well. At the end of the war, more than 2000 mujahedeen fighters were brought to Karabakh to fight against the 'infidel' Armenians. During the course of the war, Armenia was in an economical blockade.<ref>[http://sumgait.info/maraga/maraga-eng/survivors-maraghar.htm Caroline Cox - Survivors of Maraghar massacre: It was truly like a contemporary Golgotha many times over<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Croissant, Michael P.

==Azerbaijan Army==

thumb|Azerbaijan has about 95,000 troops on active duty.
Since 1994 Azerbaijan has started to increase its military budget, and since 2006 it has risen to $638&nbsp;million compared to Armenia's $162&nbsp;million. Azerbaijan further expanded its military budget to $1,5&nbsp;billion in 2007.

Azerbaijan has also implemented a new organizational style in order to modernize its army. Over the last 15&nbsp;years, Azerbaijan has been preparing its military for possible action against Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. It is feared that Azerbaijan may attempt to retake Karabakh and the surrounding regions by military force because the last negotiations in France were a failure. Azerbaijan has continually stated that it is interested in a diplomatic and  peaceful solution.
