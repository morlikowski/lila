'''Another View''' est un album d'inédits du groupe de 1986.

Tout comme ''VU'', sorti l'année précédente, ''Another View'' est composé de matériel en grande partie inédit, enregistré notamment pour ce qui aurait dû être le quatrième album du Velvet Underground.

Publié dans un premier temps comme un disque bonus du coffret "''The Velvet Underground''", ''Another View'' sera finalement commercialisé à part. Les titres de cette compilation sont souvent de qualité moindre que ceux de ''VU'', la première livraison d'inédits. Néanmoins, certains de ces morceaux avaient déjà été ré-utilisés entre temps par le groupe (sur l'album ''Loaded'') ou par Lou Reed en solo (sur les albums ''Lou Reed'' et ''Street Hassle'').

==Les titres==
Toutes les compositions sont de Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison et Maureen Tucker, sauf "We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together" et "Rock and Roll" (Reed), ainsi que "Ferryboat Bill" (Reed, Morrison, Yule, Tucker).

'''''Another View''''' is an outtakes compilation album by The Velvet Underground. It was released in 1986 by Verve Records.

==About the album==
When The Velvet Underground moved from The Velvet Underground'' in March 1969. Later that same year, however, there was a management change and MGM Records' new CEO, Mike Curb, wanted to purge the record company of all acts he considered offensive to his moral standards. The Velvet Underground quickly became one of the groups blacklisted and were released from their contract. The band had, however, in the meantime recorded fourteen tracks for possible release as their second MGM album. All of these were shelved and forgotten by their record company until the early Eighties.

As Verve (by then an mixdown format, some of them even on multitracks. The cream of the nineteen tracks was released in February of 1985 on ''VU''; the rest remained for the time being in the vaults.

In 1986, Polydor decided to prepare a vinyl box set for European release. Simply titled ''The Velvet Underground'', this box, which was released in June, consisted of the bands first three albums, ''VU'', and an untitled bonus album containing the remaining nine tracks from Polygram's vaults. That untitled album was later separately released on vinyl and CD as ''Another View''.

Since the best ten tracks had gone on ''VU'', ''Another View'' suffers somewhat in both quality and coherence. Quality-wise, there are a number of leftovers, including three instrumental takes ("Guess I'm Falling in Love", "I'm Gonna Move Right In" and "Ride into the Sun") and two versions of the same song ("Hey Mr Rain"). Additionally, ''Another View'' suffers from the same lack of coherence as ''VU'', in that the albums contain both Cale-era and Yule-era tracks. Nevertheless, lighter and simpler as ''Another View'' may be, it contains some fine songs that show the transition from the subdued less-is-more ''The Velvet Underground'' style to the more mainstream-oriented rock of 1970's ''Loaded''.

An acetate-sourced alternate mix of this album's version of "Ride Into The Sun", featuring vocals by Lou Reed, has appeared on bootlegs and on the Australian boxed set ''What Goes On''.

As The Velvet Underground moved from MGM to Atlantic, they re-recorded two of the songs on ''Another View'', "Ride into the Sun" and "Rock and Roll", for possible inclusion on ''Loaded''. Only "Rock and Roll" made the grade, but two of the ''Another View'' songs would be recycled by Lou Reed during his early solo career: "Ride into the Sun" (on ''Lou Reed'', 1972) and "We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together" (on ''Street Hassle'', 1978).
