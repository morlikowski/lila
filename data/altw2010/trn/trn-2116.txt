'''Photonic crystals''' are periodic (nano)structures that are designed to affect the motion of photons in a similar way that periodicity of a semiconductor crystal affects the motion of electrons. Photonic crystals occur in nature and in various forms have been studied by science for the last 100 years.

==Introduction==
Photonic crystals are composed of periodic (nano)structures that affect the propagation of periodic potential in a waveguiding, amongst others.

Since the basic physical phenomenon is based on visible part of the spectrum - the repeating regions of high and low dielectric constants have to be of this dimension. This makes the fabrication of optical photonic crystals cumbersome and complex.

==Naturally occurring photonic crystals==
A prominent example of a photonic crystal is the naturally occurring gemstone Morpho.<ref>P. Vukusic and J. R.

==History of photonic crystals==
Although photonic crystals have been studied in one form or another since 1887, the term “photonic crystal” was first used over 100 years later, after Eli Yablonovitch and Sajeev John published two milestone papers on photonic crystals in 1987.<ref>E. Yablonovitch "Inhibited Spontaneous Emission in Solid-State Physics and Electronics", Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 58, 2059 (1987) http://www.ee.ucla.edu/faculty/papers/eliy1987PhysRevLett.pdf</ref><ref> S. John, "Strong Localization of Photons in Certain Disordered Dielectric Superlattices", Phys. Rev. Lett. 58, 2486 (1987) http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~john/john/p2486_1.pdf</ref>

Before 1987, one-dimensional photonic crystals in the form of periodic multi-layers dielectric stacks (such as the Bragg mirror) were studied extensively. Lord Rayleigh started their study in 1887<ref>J. W. S. Rayleigh, "On the remarkable phenomenon of crystalline reflexion described by Prof. Stokes." Phil. Mag. 26, 256-265. (1888)</ref>, by showing that such systems have a one-dimensional photonic band-gap, a spectral range of large reflectivity, known as a stop-band. Today, such structures are used in a diverse range of applications; from reflective coatings to enhancing the efficiency of LEDs to highly reflective mirrors in certain laser cavities (see, for example, VCSEL). A detailed theoretical study of one-dimensional optical structures was performed by Bykov<ref>V. P. Bykov, "Spontaneous emission in a periodic structure." Sov. Phys. JETP 35, 269-273 (1972)</ref>, who was the first to investigate the effect of a photonic band-gap on the spontaneous emission from atoms and molecules embedded within the photonic structure. Bykov also speculated as to what could happen if two- or three-dimensional periodic optical structures were used.<ref>V. P. Bykov, "Spontaneous emission from a medium with a band spectrum." Sov. J. Quant. Electron. 4, 861-871 (1975)</ref> However, these ideas did not take off until after the publication of two milestone papers in 1987 by Yablonovitch and John. Both these papers concerned high dimensional periodic optical structures – photonic crystals. Yablonovitch’s main motivation was to engineer the photonic density of states, in order to control the spontaneous emission of materials embedded within the photonic crystal; John’s idea was to use photonic crystals to affect the localisation and control of light.

After 1987, the number of research papers concerning photonic crystal began to grow exponentially. However, due to the difficulty of actually fabricating these structures at optical scales (see Fabrication Challenges), early studies were either theoretical or in the microwave regime, where photonic crystals can be built on the far more readily accessible centimetre scale. (This fact is due to a property of the electromagnetic fields known as scale invariance – in essence, the electromagnetic fields, as the solutions to Maxwell's equations, has no natural length scale, and so solutions for centimetre scale structure at microwave frequencies are the same as for nanometre scale structures at optical frequencies.) By 1991, Yablonovitch had demonstrated the first three-dimensional photonic band-gap in the microwave regime.<ref>Yablonovitch, Gritter, Leung, Phys Rev Lett 67 (17) 2295-2298 (1991)</ref>

In 1996, Thomas Krauss made the first demonstration of a two-dimensional photonic crystal at optical wavelengths.<ref>Krauss TF, DeLaRue RM, Brand S "Two-dimensional photonic-bandgap structures operating at near infrared wavelengths" NATURE vol. 383 pp. 699-702 (1996)</ref> This opened up the way for photonic crystals to be fabricated in semiconductor materials by borrowing the methods used in the semiconductor industry. Today, such techniques use photonic crystal slabs, which are two dimensional photonic crystals “etched” into slabs of semiconductor; total internal reflection confines light to the slab, and allows photonic crystal effects, such as engineering the photonic dispersion to be used in the slab. Research is underway around the world to use photonic crystal slabs in integrated computer chips, in order to improve the optical processing of communications both on-chip and between chips.

Although such techniques are still to mature into commercial applications, two-dimensional photonic crystals have found commercial use in the form of photonic crystal fibres (otherwise known as holey fibres, because of the air holes that run through them). Photonic crystal fibres where first developed by Philip Russell in 1998, and can be designed to possess enhanced properties over (normal) optical fibres.

The study of three-dimensional photonic crystals has proceeded more slowly then their two-dimensional counterparts. This is because of the increased difficulty in fabrication; there was no inheritance of readily applicable techniques from the semiconductor industry for fabricators of three-dimensional photonic crystals to draw on. Attempts have been made, however, to adapt some of the same techniques, and quite advanced examples have been demonstrated<ref>Review: S.Johnson (MIT) Lecture 3: Fabrication technologies for 3d photonic crystals, a survey http://ab-initio.mit.edu/photons/tutorial/L3-fab.pdf</ref>, for example in the construction of "woodpile" structures constructed on a planar layer-by-layer basis. Another strand of research has been to try and construct three-dimensional photonic structures from self-assembly – essentially allowing a mixture of dielectric nano-spheres to settle from solution into three-dimensionally periodic structures possessing photonic band-gaps.

==Fabrication challenges==
The major challenge for higher dimensional photonic crystals is in fabrication of these structures, with sufficient precision to prevent scattering losses blurring the crystal properties and with processes that can be robustly mass produced. One promising method of fabrication for two-dimensionally periodic photonic crystals is a communications fiber it meets these two requirements, and photonic crystal fibres are commercially available. Another promising method for developing two-dimensional photonic crystals is the so-called photonic crystal slab. These structures consist of a slab of material (such as silicon) which can be patterned using techniques borrowed from the semiconductor industry. Such chips offer the potential to combine photonic processing with electronic processing on a single chip.
