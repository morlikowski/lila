'''Drew Gooden''', né le 24 septembre 1981, est un joueur de basket-ball. Il évolue au poste d'ailier fort

== Biographie ==

Il a effectué sa carrière NCAA à l'Université du Kansas.

il est drafté en quatrième place de la Draft 2002 par les Memphis Grizzlies. Il y joue 51 matches pour devenir un joueur assez essentiel et bon rebondeur.
Ces qualités le font participer au transfert de Orlando pour la fin de saison où il s'exprime assez bien aux cotés de Tracy McGrady, notamment lors de la série l'opposant aux Détroit Pistons en playoffs.

Orlando connait ensuite une période difficile mais Gooden sera bientôt envoyé aux Cleveland Cavaliers pour rejoindre LeBron James. Les Cavaliers, en pleine progression, l'intègrent parfaitement en seconde option de l'équipe.

Le 21 fevrier 2008, Gooden est envoyé aux Bulls de Chicago dans un échange de 11 joueurs entre 3 équipes<ref> [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2008-02-21-wallace-trade_N.htm ''Cavaliers acquire Ben Wallace in 11-player deal''], USA Today, 21 février 2008.</ref>.

Il mesure 2,08m pour à peu près 113 kg. Il porte le numéro 90 des Bulls.

'''Andrew Melvin "Drew" Gooden'''<ref>[http://www2.kusports.com/stats/nba_hawks/drew_gooden ''Lawrence Journal-World'']</ref> (born American professional power forward from the University of Kansas.

==High school==
Before Gooden played the center position at Bloomington High School in Bloomington, Illinois for a half semester in his freshman year. After going back to California, he, as a senior, led his Gauchos to the 1999 California Interscholastic Federation Boys Division III championship game.  Washington Union High School (led by NBA guard DeShawn Stevenson) won the championship game over El Cerrito HS by a score of 77-71.<ref>[http://www.socalhoops.tierranet.com/archive/prepnotes/0399/washingtonunion0320.htm ''Southern Cal Hoops'']</ref>

==College==
Gooden joined Nick Collison and Kirk Hinrich in a trio of fabulous freshmen for the 1999-2000 season. Although at times Gooden was frustrated with the way things were going his freshman year, he finally adjusted to coach Roy Williams' system.

In his freshman year, KU went 24-10 and lost to the 2000 NCAA Basketball Tournament. The next season, the Jayhawks went 26-7 and fell to the Illinois Fighting Illini, coached by future KU coach Bill Self, in the 2001 NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen.

His most successful season was 2002, where he led the nation in rebounding and was named NABC national player of the year. The Jayhawks went 33-4, including 16-0 in Big 12 Conference play to win KU its first conference championship since 1998. The Jayhawks also advanced to their first Final Four in the 2002 NCAA Tournament since 1993; however, they lost to the eventual national champion Maryland Terrapins in the semifinal.

During Gooden's freshman season, at the end of a home loss to the Iowa State Cyclones, one of the Cyclone stars, either Marcus Fizier or Jamaal Tinsley, celebrated the victory by spiking the ball on the Allen Fieldhouse floor. Two years later, Gooden returned the favor when he spiked the ball in the Hilton Coliseum court following a victory that ended the Jayhawks' five-game losing streak to ISU.

For being named NABC player of the year for 2002, Gooden's jersey (#0) was retired in 2003, at halftime of a KU home game with Kansas State in what would have been his senior year had he not foregone his senior year for the NBA.

==NBA Draft==
Gooden declared himself for the draft after his impressive junior year. Out of the University of Kansas, Gooden was selected as the 4th overall pick by the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2002 NBA Draft.

==Professional==
As a professional, Gooden has established himself as a solid power forward, consistently bringing down double digit numbers in points and rebounds. He is also considered a good guy on and off the court, named one of the "Good Guys in Sports" by The Sporting News.<ref> Tom Withers [http://www2.kusports.com/stats/nba_hawks/drew_gooden ''Lawrence Journal-World'']</ref>
