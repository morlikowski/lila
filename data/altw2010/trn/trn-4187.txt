'''לוגוס''' (בנוצרית מזרחית.

הלוגוס, על פי הנצרות המזרחית, הוא מקור ומהות החיים הנפשיים והגופניים של כל היצורים החיים. הנצרות היוונית המזרחית מזהה את הלוגוס עם ישו ויש גם המזהים את הלוגוס עם השילוש הקדוש. מהות הלוגוס, המכונה גם בשם "הרוח האלוהית", היווה סלע מחלוקת בין תאולוגים נוצרים שונים, מחלוקות שהביאו לפילוגים בכנסייה.

למונח לוגוס יש משמעויות שונות בשפה היוונית ובהן: מילה, היגיון, לימוד או שיחה. אך הפילוסוף היווני הרקליטוס היה הראשון שנתן למונח זה משמעות פילוסופית כאחדות המנהיגה את הכול, האחראית להיווצרות היקום ולסדר השורר בו.

האסכולה הסטואית בפילוסופיה היוונית אמצה לעצמה את רעיונותיו של הרקליטוס, הגדירה את הלוגוס כתבונה השוררת ביקום וזיהתה אותו עם אלוהים או עם הטבע. 

קיקרו בספרו " על טבע האלים" מסביר את מחשבתם של ראשוני הפילוסופים הסטואיים: "התבונה האלוהית חייבת להיות מונחת ביסודו של היקום... שלמותו של הטבע הכולל בתוכו את כל הדברים, מודרכת על ידי הלוגוס... לכן היקום הוא אלוהים והטבע כולו אלוהי."

'''''' (Greek , = logos) is an important term in λέγω ''legō'': to count, tell, say, or speak.<ref>see entries for [http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/dict?name=lsj&lang=el&word=lo%2fgos&filter=GreekXlit "λόγος"] and [http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/dict?name=lsj&lang=el&word=le%2fgw&filter=GreekXlit "λέγω (B)"] in Liddell, Henry and Robert Scott. 1996. ''A Greek-English Lexicon''. Revised by H.S. Jones and R. McKenzie. Ninth edition, with revised supplement. Oxford: Clarendon Press.</ref> The primary meaning of logos is: something said; by implication a subject, topic of discourse, or reasoning. Secondary meanings such as logic, reasoning, etc. derive from the fact that if one is capable of λέγειν (infinitive) i.e. speech, then intelligence and reason are assumed.

Its word" to notions such as "thought, speech, account, meaning, proportion, principle, standard", or "logic".
In English, the word is the root of "logic," and of the "-ology" suffix (e.g., geology).<ref name="Oxford">[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O27-logy.html Oxford Dictionary definition]:'' -logy repr. F. -logie, medL. -logia, Gr. -logíā, which is partly f. lógos discourse, speech, partly f. log-, var. of leg-, légein speak; hence derivs. in -logia mean either''</ref> 

Heraclitus established the term in Western philosophy as meaning both the source and fundamental order of the cosmos.
The sophists used the term to mean discourse, and Aristotle applied the term to rational discourse.
The divine animating principle pervading the universe.
After Judaism came under Hellenistic influence, Philo adopted the term into Jewish philosophy.
The Gospel of John identifies Jesus as the incarnation of the Logos, through which all things are made. 
The gospel further identifies the Logos as God (''theos'').

Psychologist Carl Jung used the term for the masculine principle of rationality.

==Uses in ancient Greek==
In ordinary, non-technical Greek, ''logos'' had two overlapping meanings. One meaning referred to an instance of speaking: "sentence, saying, oration"; the other meaning was the λέγω. It also means the inward intention underlying the speech act: "hypothesis, thought, grounds for belief or action." <ref>LSJ ''s''. logos, lexis.</ref>

==Use in ancient philosophy==
===Heraclitus===
The writing of Heraclitus (ca. 535–475 BCE) was the first place where the word ''logos'' was given special attention in ancient Greek philosophy.<ref>F.E. Peters, ''Greek Philosophical Terms'', New York University Press, 1967.</ref> Though Heraclitus "quite deliberately plays on the various meanings of ''logos''",<ref>K.F. Johansen, "Logos" in Donald Zeyl (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Classical Philosophy'', Greenwood Press 1997.</ref> there is no compelling reason to suppose that he used it in a special technical sense, significantly different from the way it was used in ordinary Greek of his time.<ref>pp. 419ff. , W. K. C. Guthrie, ''A History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, Cambridge University Press, 1962.</ref>
<blockquote>This LOGOS holds always but humans always prove unable to understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this LOGOS, humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep. (Diels-Kranz 22B1)</blockquote>
<blockquote>For this reason it is necessary to follow what is common. But although the LOGOS is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding. (Diels-Kranz 22B2)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Listening not to me but to the LOGOS it is wise to agree that all things are one. (Diels-Kranz 22B50)<ref>Translations from Richard D. McKirahan, ''Philosophy before Socrates'', Hackett, 1994.</ref></blockquote>

===Aristotle's rhetorical logos===
Aristotle defined ''logos'' as argument from reason, one of the three modes of persuasion.
The other two modes are pathos (), persuasion by means of emotional appeal, and ethos, persuasion through convincing listeners of one's moral competence. 
An argument based on logos needs to be logical, and in fact the term ''logic'' derives from it. 
Logos normally implies numbers, polls, and other mathematical or scientific data.

Logos has many advantages:
*Data is hard to manipulate, so it is harder to argue against a logos argument.
*Logos makes the speaker look prepared and knowledgeable to the audience, enhancing ethos.

===The Stoics===
In Stoic philosophy, which began with Zeno of Citium c. 300 BCE, the ''logos'' was the active reason pervading the universe and animating it. It was conceived of as material, and is usually identified with God or Nature. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal logos'', ("''logos spermatikos''") or the law of generation in the universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate matter. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos''.<ref>Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pages 37-38. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.</ref>

===Philo of Alexandria===
Philo (20 BC - 50 AD), a Hellenized Jew, used the term logos to mean the creative principle. Philo followed the Platonic distinction between imperfect matter and perfect idea. The logos was necessary, he taught, because God cannot come into contact with matter. He sometimes identified logos as divine wisdom.

===Translations===
Logos is usually translated as "the Word" in English KJV.

Gordon Clark (1902 - 1985), a Calvinist theologian and expert on pre-Socratic philosophy, famously translated ''Logos'' as "Logic": "In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God and the Logic was God." He meant to imply by this translation that the laws of logic were contained in the Bible itself and were therefore not a secular principle imposed on the Christian world view.

The notorious question of how to translate ''logos'' is topicalised in Goethe's Faust, with Faust finally opting for "deed, action" (''Am Anfang war die Tat'').

Some Chinese translations have used the word "Tao (道)".

The term ''Logos'' also reflects the term ''dabar Yahweh" ("Word of God") in the Hebrew Bible.

In his book, "Zero, the Biography of a Dangerous Idea." Charles Seife notes that the Greek word for 'ratio' was 'logos'. Thus the translation of John 1:1 reads: "In the beginning, there was the ratio, and the ratio was with God, and the ratio was God."<ref></ref>

===John 1:1===

In Christianity, the prologue of the Gospel of John calls Jesus "the Logos". 

John's placement of the Word at creation reflects Genesis, in which God (Elohim) speaks the world into being, beginning with the words "Let there be light."
The Greek text reads , notably omitting the definite article in the second occurrence of θεος "god". Greek has no indefinite article, and  literally translates to "a god was the word" (the translation as a proper name, "God was the word" would strictly require ).

Jerome's ''Vulgate'' translation is straightforward "In principio erat Verbum et Verbum erat apud Deum et Deus erat Verbum", since Latin has neither definite nor indefinite articles. The KJV has "the Word was God".
Some scholars, however, disagree with this translation and the subsequent interpretation of the text. It should be noted that this objection is primarily associated with scholars from the Jehova's Witnesses, and reflects the teaching of that group. Such translations render John 1:1 to state "and the Word was a god" rather than the more Traditional "the Word was God." This translation is seen in Bible Versions such as the NWT, as well as several German Translations.

Ernst Haenchen, in a commentary on the Gospel of John (chapters 1-6), takes note of the absence of a definite article: 

 
After giving as a translation of John 1:1c "and divine (of the category divinity) was the Word," Haenchen goes on to state: "In this instance, the verb 'was' ([en]) simply expresses predication. And the predicate noun must accordingly be more carefully observed: [the·os′] is not the same thing as [ho the·os′] ('divine' is not the same thing as 'God')." Other scholars, such as Philip B. Harner elaborate on the grammatical construction found here (Journal of Biblical Literature, 1973, pp. 85, 87).  Apart from Jehovah Witnesses and some others, the understanding of the language of the original makes the "Word" emphatically "God," as the absence of the definite article makes the "Word" God by nature; ie, not 'a' god, but the Word was God.

Some scholars have suggested that John made creative use of double meaning in the word "Logos" to communicate to both Jews, who were familiar with the Wisdom tradition in Judaism, and Hellenic polytheism, especially followers of Philo (Hellenistic Judaism). Each of these two groups had its own history associated with the concept of the Logos, and each could understand John's use of the term from one or both of those contexts.
