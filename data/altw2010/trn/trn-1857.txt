==Plot==
Chris Taylor (American who has abandoned college for combat duty in Vietnam.  The year is 1967.  Upon arrival, he sees dead soldiers ''in body bags'' being loaded into his plane. Taylor and several other replacements have been assigned to Bravo Company, 25th Infantry, "somewhere near the Cambodian border."  Worn down by the exhausting work and poor living conditions, his enthusiasm for the war wanes and he develops an admiration for the more experienced soldiers, despite their reluctance to extend their friendship.  

One night while on patrol, his sleeping unit is set upon by a squad of North Vietnamese Army soldiers.  One soldier is killed and another maimed. Despite having passed the watch duty to a more experienced soldier, who fell asleep, Taylor is blamed for the casualties.  The platoon's most seasoned sergeants, the compassionate Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe) and harsh Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger), argue. Taylor discovers a light wound to his neck, and he is sent to the field hospital for treatment.

Taylor returns from the hospital and gains acceptance from a tight-knit group in his unit that socialises, dances, and consumes drugs in an underground clubhouse.  Next door, more conservative members of the unit drink beer and play cards. As the patrols continue, Taylor becomes a more seasoned soldier, no longer standing out amongst the others. During one patrol, a soldier goes missing. His mutilated body is found tied to a post close by.  The platoon reaches a nearby village, where a food and weapons cache is discovered.  Despite the villagers' denials, Barnes believes they are aiding Viet Cong soldiers and shoots an elderly woman in the head. The other soldiers explore the village.  In one house, Taylor discovers a disabled boy and his mother hiding in a ditch beneath the floor.  He harasses and taunts the boy, and Bunny (Kevin Dillon) beats the boy to death.  Outside, Sergeant Elias arrives and gets into a fistfight with Barnes over the incidents.  Lieutenant Wolfe (Mark Moses) ends the fight, and orders the men to burn the village.

Upon returning to base, Elias reports Barnes' actions to Captain Harris (Dale Dye), who cannot afford to remove Barnes due to a lack of personnel. Taylor speaks of this as "a civil war in the platoon. Half with Elias, half with Barnes." On their next patrol the platoon is ambushed and becomes pinned down in a firefight.  Elias, with Taylor and two other soldiers, goes to intercept flanking enemy troops.  Barnes orders the rest of the platoon to retreat to be airlifted from the area, and goes back into the jungle to find Elias' group.  After sending Taylor and the two soldiers back, Barnes finds Elias. Barnes fires three rounds into Elias' chest and leaves him for dead. Barnes reaches the helicopter, telling the others that Elias is dead. After they take off, a severely wounded Elias emerges from the jungle, running from a large group of NVA soldiers. As the helicopter circles overhead, he dies after being shot several more times by the NVA.
 
At the base, Taylor attempts to talk his group into killing Barnes in retaliation.  Barnes overhears  this, and enters the room, and tells them to kill him.  No one takes up the offer, but as Barnes leaves, Taylor attacks him.  Barnes manages to get the upper hand, and holds a knife to Taylor's face.  However, one of the men in the group talks Barnes out of killing Taylor, so he leaves, but not before cutting him under the eye. 

The platoon is later sent back to the ambush area in order to build and maintain heavy defensive positions against potential attack.  That night a large attack occurs, and the defensive lines are broken.  During the chaos, Barnes and Taylor come face-to-face. As Barnes is about to kill Taylor with a shovel, the two are knocked unconscious by a last-ditch US napalm attack. A wounded Taylor regains consciousness the next morning and finds Barnes, who is also wounded. Taylor aims a rifle at Barnes, who dares him to pull the trigger. Taylor shoots Barnes three times in the chest, killing him.  He then collapses and awaits medical attention.  As he is loaded onto the helicopter, Taylor is reminded that because he has been wounded twice, he can go home. The helicopter flies away and Taylor weeps as he stares down at the destruction.

After his tour of duty in Vietnam ended in 1968, Stone wrote a screenplay called ''Break'': a semi-autobiographical account detailing his experiences with his parents and his time in Vietnam. It featured several characters who were the seeds of those who would end up in ''Platoon''. The script was set to music from The Doors; Stone sent the script to Jim Morrison in the hope he would play the lead (Morrison never responded). Though ''Break'' went ultimately unproduced, it was the spur for him to attend film school.<ref name="salewicz"/>

After penning several other produced screenplays in the early 1970s, Stone came to work with Midnight Express'' in 1978. Despite that film's critical and commercial success, and that of other Stone-penned films at the time, most studios were still reluctant to finance ''The Platoon'', as they feared a film about the Vietnam War would not attract an audience. After the release of ''The Deer Hunter'' (1978) and ''Apocalypse Now'' (1979), they then cited the perception that these films were considered the pinnacle of the Vietnam War film genre as reasons not to make ''The Platoon''.<ref name="salewicz"/>

Stone instead attempted to break into mainstream direction via the easier-to-finance horror genre, but ''Year of the Dragon'' (1985) for a lower-than-usual fee of $200,000, on the condition from producer Hemdale''. Once again, this was a project that Stone had struggled to secure financing for, but Daly loved the script and was prepared to finance both ''Salvador'' and ''The Platoon'' off the back of it. Stone shot ''Salvador'' first, before turning his attention to what was by now called ''Platoon''.<ref name="salewicz"/>

==Production==
thumb|The famous scene depicting Elias with his hands in the air is a recreation of a 1968 photograph by Art Greenspon.<ref name="dvd"/>
''Platoon'' was filmed on the island of Luzon in the Philippines, starting in February 1986. The production of the film on a scheduled date was almost canceled due to the political upheaval in the country with then-dictator Ferdinand Marcos, but with the help of a producer well-known in Asia, Mark Hill, the shoot went on as scheduled. The shoot lasted 54 days and cost $6.5 million. The production made a deal with the Philippine military for the use of military equipment.<ref name="salewicz"></ref>

James Woods, who had starred in Stone's previous film, ''Salvador'', was offered a part in ''Platoon''. He turned the role down, later saying he "couldn't face going into another jungle with [Stone]". Upon arrival in the Philippines, the cast was sent on a two-week intensive training course, during which they had to dig foxholes and were subject to forced marches and night-time "ambushes" which utilized special-effects explosions. Stone explained that he was trying to break them down, "to fuck with their heads so we could get that dog-tired, don't give a damn attitude, the anger, the irritation... the casual approach to death".<ref name="salewicz"/> 

Stone makes a U.S. Marine Corps Vietnam veteran who also acted as the film's technical advisor. <ref name="dvd"/>

Music used in the film includes ''White Rabbit'' by Okie From Muskogee'' by Fortunate Son'' by Creedence Clearwater Revival. During a scene in the "Underworld" the soldiers sing along to ''The Tracks of My Tears'' by Smokey Robinson and The Miracles.
