The group is currently preparing to release their second studio album ''Doll Domination'' on September 16, 2008.

==Dance troupe==
Sources claim that Robin Antin began exploring the idea of a modern burlesque troupe in 1993 with her friend Christina Applegate.<ref>[http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Pussycat_Dolls/Biography/ Pussycat Dolls Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Apr-08-Fri-2005/weekly/26226584.html reviewjournal.com - Neon: Beyond Burlesque<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The dance troupe's first performance was in 1995. During this period, they performed with numerous guest vocalists, with a repertoire of 1950s and 1960s pop standards while dressed in lingerie or old-fashioned pin-up costumes.
They secured a Thursday night residency at The Roxy. The group became internationally popular and was featured in magazines, television specials for MTV and VH1, ad campaigns, and movies. Some of the Pussycat Dolls appeared in the 2002 film ''Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle'', dancing to "The Pink Panther Theme".

Along with Applegate, pop  recording group, and became employees of Iovine's label Interscope Records. The only troupe member who remained after the re-casting process was Carmit Bachar.  Electra, when asked about her lack of involvement with the group's evolution into a pop group, said: "I was part of the Dolls for over two years and did every show with them... but financially, I couldn't become part of their new music project... It was a sacrifice I couldn't make."<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com ''Contactmusic.com''] </ref> However, she did make a cameo appearance in the music video for "Don't Cha". In late 2003, Electra formed another burlesque troupe called '''The Bombshell Babies''', which included ex-Dolls Staci Flood and Nadine Ellis. 

At least one early member of the L.A. dance troupe, Rachel Sterling, made the move to the Las Vegas show.<ref>http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&VideoID=27861647</ref>
