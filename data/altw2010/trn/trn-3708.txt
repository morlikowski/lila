'''Jerry Colonna''' (b. '''Gerardo Luigi Colonna''',  September 17, 1904, Boston, Massachusetts - November 21, 1986) was an Italian-American comedian, singer and songwriter, remembered best as the zaniest Bob Hope sidekick on Hope's popular radio shows and films of the 1940s and 1950s. 

With his pop-eyed facial expressions and walrus-sized handlebar mustache, Colonna was known for singing loudly, "in a comic caterwaul," according to ''Raised on Radio'' author Gerald Nachman, for dropping the catch phrase "Who's Yehudi?" after many an old joke, even if it had nothing to do with the joke. It was believed to be named for violin virtuoso Yehudi Menuhin, and the search for Yehudi became a running gag on the Hope show.

Colonna played a range of nitwitted characters, the best remembered of which was the moronic professor. "Colonna brought a whacked-out touch to Hope's show", Nachman wrote. "In a typical exchange, Hope asks, 'Professor, did you plant the bomb in the embassy like I told you?', to which Colonna replied, in that whooping five-alarm voice, 'Embassy? Great Scott, I thought you said NBC!' "

==Musical madness==
Colonna's career actually began musically: In the 1930s, he had been a trombonist with the CBS house orchestra, the Columbia Symphony--developing a reputation for prankishness. His off-stage antics were so infamous that CBS nearly fired him on more than one occasion. Fred Allen, then on CBS, gave Colonna periodic guest slots, and a decade later he joined John Scott Trotter's band on Bing Crosby's ''Kraft Music Hall''.

In an opera parody, Colonna hollered an aria "in a deadpan screech that became his trademark on Bob Hope's show," Nachman noted. Colonna was one of three 1940s ''Kraft Music Hall'' discoveries. The others were pianist-comedian Victor Borge and the Trotter band's drummer, music "depreciationist" Spike Jones.

According to radio historian Arthur Frank Wertheim, in ''Radio Comedy'', Colonna was responsible for many of the Hope show's catch phrases--particularly, "Give me a drag on that before you throw it away", a crack the cast came to use to lance anyone's bragging. Colonna's usual greeting to Hope or other characters on the show was, "Greetings, Gate," and the show's listeners began using it as well. 

Colonna was part of several of Hope's early USO tours during the 1940s. Jack Benny's singing sidekick Dennis Day, a talented impressionist as well as singer, was known to do a superb imitation of Colonna's manic style and expressions. 

==Films==
He appeared in two of Hope's famous ''Road'' films (with Crosby), ''The Road to Singapore'' (1940, as Achilles Bombassa) and ''The Road to Rio'' (1947, as a Cavalry captain), along with a memorable appearance in the 1945 Fred Allen vehicle, ''It's in the Bag!'', as the psychiatrist Dr. Greenglass. He also made a brief appearance with Hope in the "Wife, Husband, & Wolf" sketch in ''Star-Spangled Rhythm.''

He provided the voice of the March Hare in the Alice in Wonderland'' (1951) (another radio legend, Ed Wynn, voiced the Mad Hatter) and also lent his zany narration style to several Disney shorts, including ''Casey at the Bat'' (1946) and ''The Brave Engineer'' (1950).
