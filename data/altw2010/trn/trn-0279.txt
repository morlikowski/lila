『'''宇宙伝説ユリシーズ31'''』（うちゅうでんせつユリシーズサーティーワン）は、 東京ムービー新社とフランス・DIC制作のテレビアニメ。全26話。

==概要==
日本のユリシーズが活躍する叙事詩『フィガロで高い評価を受けた。

日本では1986年5月から7月にかけて、キングレコード発売で1巻に4話収録のビデオアニメ『ユリシーズ31』として全3巻がようやく公開された。このため初めはOVA扱い。名古屋テレビをキー局にテレビ朝日系列で、1988年2月6日から4月23日まで放送されたのはこのビデオ版の12話分である。当時、テレビ朝日系での毎週土曜日17時30分から18時00分までの時間帯は日本サンライズ制作のアニメが占めており、そうした中で東京ムービー新社制作の本作の放映は異例であり、『機甲戦記ドラグナー』と『鎧伝サムライトルーパー』の間に挟まれて穴埋めといった感が強いものであった。

なお、朝日放送ではテレビドラマ『部長刑事』の関係で金曜日に先行放送した。

その後、1991年8月27日から10月2日にかけて声優を変更しNHK衛星第2テレビジョンで26話全てが放送された。

2007年、カートゥーンネットワークで放送された。声優変更バージョンであるが、NHKで放送されたものと同じかどうかは不明。

なお、『巨人の星』『勇者ライディーン』『超電磁ロボ コン・バトラーV』などの代表作を持つ監督の長浜忠夫は本作の制作中に逝去。これが遺作となった。その後、作画監督の荒木伸吾らが中心となって後を引き継いで本作を完成させた。

ちなみに日本未発売であるがポピー (玩具メーカー)が玩具を発売している。

==ストーリー==
神話と科学が存在する世界、ユリシーズと仲間達の宇宙を駆け巡る冒険の物語。
