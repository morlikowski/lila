==Однодекадные розарии==
thumb|400px|Серебряное кольцо-розарий

Во времена преследования  католиков в Англии и Ирландии с ирландский розарий и кольцо-розарий для скрытого ношения.

Кольца-розарии также назывались солдатскими, потому что их часто брали с собой на битву солдаты. Данный тип представляет собой кольцо с десятью отметками и крестом, что означает одну декаду розария. Для удобства иногда состоит из двух соединенных вращающихся частей.

== Порядок чтения ==
Совершается крестное знамение, целуется крест на чётках и читается вступительная молитва Розария.
Берётся крест и читается Апостольский символ веры.
Берётся первая бусинка и читается Отче наш.
На трёх следующих — три раза Слава. Эти молитвы составляют вступление Розария.
После этого объявляется название вида тайн и первой тайны. На большой бусинке читается Слава. По окончании молитвы по Розарию читаются заключительные молитвы.

== История ==

Первые упоминания об использовании схожих с Розарием молитв по чёткам в христианских монастырях относятся к IX веку. Современный вид чётки приобрели в XIII веке. Католическая традиция официально связывает их появление с явлением Девы Марии св. Доминику в доминиканцев в Лепанто, в память о которой был установлен праздник Девы Марии — Царицы Розария (7 октября).

Порядок чтения Розария с ходом времени существенно не менялся, за одним исключением — в 2002 папа Иоанн Павел II добавил светлые тайны к трём исторически существовавшим: радостным, скорбным и славным.

The '''Rosary''' (from Mysteries of the Rosary, which are events in the lives of Jesus Christ and his mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Theologian Mariology being inherent in Christology; a sentiment also expressed by saints such as Louis de Montfort who was a strong rosary advocate.<ref>''Mariology Is Christology'' in Vittorio Messori, "The Mary Hypothesis" Rome, 2005</ref><ref>Louis de Montfort, in God Alone</ref>
Pope Leo XIII also viewed the rosary as a vital means to participate in the life of Mary and to find the way to Christ (see the section on ''Rosary Pope'' below).<ref name="autogenerated3">Encyclical Jucunda Semper 8.9.1894 quoted in Marienlexikon,Eos St. Ottilien, 1988  42</ref> 

The traditional fifteen Mysteries of the Rosary were finalized by the 16th century. The mysteries are grouped into three sets: the joyful mysteries, the sorrowful mysteries, and the glorious mysteries. In 2002, Pope John Paul II announced five new optional mysteries, the luminous mysteries, bringing the total number of mysteries to twenty. 

The rosary is  part of the Catholic veneration of Mary, which has been promoted by numerous popes, especially Roman Catholic liturgical calendar as the Feast of Pope John Paul II's Apostolic Letter ''Rosarium Virginis Mariae'']</ref>  built on the "total Marian devotion" pioneered by Saint Louis de Montfort.   Pope Pius XII and his successors actively promoted the veneration of the Virgin  in Lourdes and Fatima,  which is credited with a new resurgence of the rosary within the Catholic Church. <ref name="autogenerated2">Heinz, 555</ref>

The rosary is sometimes used by other Evangelical Protestants, however, such as Baptists and Presbyterians do not use it and actively discourage their members from using this method of prayer.

Many similar prayer practices exist in popular Roman Catholicism, each with its own set of prescribed prayers and its own form of chaplets."

The term is also used to refer to similar beads in other religions<ref>http://www.thefreedictionary.com/rosary</ref>.

== History ==
thumb|right|170px|"Madonna with the Rosary" by [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murrillo, 1650, an example of Roman Catholic Marian art featuring the rosary.]]
There are differing views on the history of the rosary. According to tradition, the rosary was given to apparition by the Blessed Virgin Mary in the year 1214 in the church of Prouille. This Marian apparition received the title of Our Lady of the Rosary.<ref name="autogenerated6">Catherine Beebe, ''St. Dominic and the Rosary'' ISBN 0898705185 </ref> However, most scholarly research suggests a more gradual and organic development of the rosary.<ref name=encycrosary></ref>

Prayers with beads like the rosary may have begun as a practice by the monastic lay monastics could not read, they substituted 150 repetitions of the Our Father (''Pater noster'' in Latin) for the Psalms, sometimes using a cord with knots on it to keep an accurate count.<ref name=encycrosary/> During the middle ages, evidence suggests that both the Our Father and the Hail Mary were recited with prayer beads. In the 7th century, Saint Eligius wrote of using a counting device to keep track of the 150 Hail Marys of the ''Psalter of Mary''.<ref name="autogenerated4">[http://books.google.com/books?q=one+hundred+and+fifty+gold+and+silver+nails%2C+that+by+the+signs+of+the+nails+she+might+repeat+the+Psalter+of+Blessed+Mary.&btnG=Search+Books O'Reilly, Bernard. ''True Men as We Need Them: A Book of Instruction for Men in the World.'' New York: P.J. Kennedy and Sons. (1878) p. 217.]</ref> In 13th century Paris, four trade guilds existed of prayer bead makers, who were referred to as ''paternosterers'', and the beads were referred to as ''paternosters'', suggesting a continued link between the Our Father (''Pater noster'' in Latin) and the prayer beads.<ref name=encycrosary/> In the 12th century, the rule of the English anchorites, the ''Ancrene Wisse'', specified how groups of fifty Hail Marys were to be broken into five decades of ten Hail Marys each.<ref name=encycrosary/> Gradually, the Hail Mary came to replace the Our Father as the prayer most associated with beads. Eventually, each decade came to be preceded by an Our Father, which further mirrored the structure of the monastic Liturgy of the Hours.

The practice of meditation during the recitation of the German monk from Luminous Mysteries.

Since the 17th century, the Rosary began to appear as an element in key pieces of Murrillo's ''Madonna with the Roary'' at the Museo del Prado in Spain, and the statute of ''Madonna with Rosary'' at the church of San Nazaro Maggiore in Milan. Several Roman Catholic Marian churches around the world have also been named after the rosary, e.g. ''Our Lady of the Rosary Basilica'', in Rosario Argentina, the ''Rosary Basilica'' in Lourdes and ''Nossa Senhora do Rosário'' in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

== Rosary beads ==
right|thumbnail|200px|Rosary beads

A rosary provides a physical method of keeping track of the number of Hail Marys said. The fingers are moved along the beads as the prayers are recited. By not having to keep track of the count mentally, the mind is more able to meditate on the mysteries. A five decade rosary contains five groups of ten beads (a decade), with additional large beads before each decade. The Hail Mary is said on the ten beads within a decade, while the Our Father is said on the large bead before each decade. A new mystery is meditated upon at each of the large beads. Some rosaries, particularly those used by religious orders, contain fifteen decades, corresponding to the traditional fifteen mysteries of the rosary. Both five and fifteen decade rosaries are attached to a shorter strand, which starts with a crucifix followed by one large, three small, and one large beads before connecting to the rest of the rosary. The recitation of the rosary is started on the short strand, reciting the Apostle's Creed at the crucifix, an Our Father at the first large bead, three Hail Marys on the next three beads, then a Glory be to the Father on the next large bead. The recitation of the decades then follows. Although counting the prayers on a string of beads is customary, the prayers of the rosary do not actually require a set of beads, but can be said using any type of counting device, by counting on one's fingers, or by counting by oneself without any device at all.

The beads can be made from a wide variety of materials including wood, bone, glass, crushed flowers, semi-precious stones such as agate, jet, amber, or jasper, or precious materials including coral, crystal, silver, and gold. Rosaries are sometimes made from the seeds of the "rosary pea" or "bead tree". Today, the vast majority of rosary beads are made of glass, plastic, or wood. Early rosaries were strung on strong thread, often silk, but modern ones are more often made as a series of chain-linked beads. Our Lady's Rosary Makers produce some 7 million rosaries annually that are distributed to those in economic and spiritual need.<ref>[http://www.olrm.org/ "Our Lady's Rosary Makers" website. <www.olrm.org>. Access date: 15 May 2008.]</ref>

It is especially common for beads to be made of material with some special significance, such as jet from the shrine of St. James at sacramental.

In addition to a string of beads the rosary comes in other forms for ease of use. A ring rosary is a finger ring with eleven knobs on it, ten round ones and one crucifix. A rosary bracelet is one with ten beads and often a cross or medal as well. The most modern form is the rosary card. A rosary card is either one with a "handle" that moves like a slide rule to count the decade, or it has a whole rosary with bumps similar to Braille.

The recitation of the Rosary is traditionally dedicated to one of three sets of "Mysteries" to be said in sequence, one per day: the ''Joyful'' (sometimes ''Joyous'') ''Mysteries''; the ''Sorrowful Mysteries''; and the ''Glorious Mysteries''. Each of these three sets of Mysteries has within it five different themes to be meditated on, one for each decade of ten Hail Marys. Pope John Paul II, in his apostolic letter ''Rosarium Virginis Mariae'' (October 2002), recommended an additional set called the ''Luminous Mysteries'' (or the "Mysteries of Light").<ref name ="John Paul II"/> Catholic faithful who prefer the original fifteen mysteries point to the belief that the Rosary is Mary's Psalter, containing 150 Hail Marys in its body for the 150 Psalms.<ref>[http://sicutincaelo.org/y15.html St. Louis-Marie de Montfort explains this correlation]</ref> The ''Luminous Mysteries'' make the total 200, but incorporate Christ's ministry. 

In addition to meditating upon the events of the mysteries, many people associate certain virtues, or fruits, with each mystery.
''(The following list of mysteries and the fruits associated with them<ref>[http://www.montfort.org.uk/Writings/MSR.html St. Louis-Marie de Montfort, Methods for saying the rosary, first and third method]</ref> corresponds to moments in the life, passion, and death of Mary's participation in them chronologically.)''

== Approved form ==
* A sign of the cross on the Crucifix and then the "Apostles' Creed";
* An "Our Father" on the first large bead;
* A "Hail Mary" on each of the three small beads with the following intentions (the theological virtues):
*# For the increase of faith
*# For the increase of hope
*# For the increase of charity
* A "Glory Be to the Father" on the next large bead;
* Announce the mystery
* An "Our Father" on the large bead
* A "Hail Mary" on each of the adjacent ten small beads;
* A "Glory Be to the Father" on the next large bead;
* Again an Our Father, ten Hail Marys, the Glory Be to the Father, and Fatima Prayer for each of the following decades;
* A "Hail Holy Queen" and a sign of the cross.

=== Common pious additions ===
Many people add a recitation of the Fatima Decade Prayer at the end of each Decade. Others add a recitation of a pious Eucharistic prayer "O Sacrament Most Holy, O Sacrament Divine, All praise and all thanksgiving be every moment thine" at the end of each decade in honor of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament.  In the practice of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, they have an additional decade for the intentions of the students or the Blessed Virgin Mary.

A pious German custom is to insert a phrase in the middle of each Hail Mary (after "... blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus&nbsp;... "), which refers to the specific mystery being meditated upon. <ref>[http://rosarycreations.com/rosaryprayersgerman.htm Rosary Prayers in German<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.pacifier.com/~rosarweb/rosaryprayers.htm Rosary Prayers in Several Languages<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
This custom was incorporated into St. Louis de Montfort's second method out of his five Methods of Praying the Rosary.<ref>[http://www.montfort.org.uk/Writings/MSR.html Methods for Saying the Rosary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

In the practice of the Divine Office:

# In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
# Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
# Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
# O Lord, open my lips.
# And my mouth will proclaim your praise.
# Incline your aid to me, O God.
# O Lord, make haste to help me.
# Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

=== Rosary as a family prayer===
Rosary is usually prayed in Church during afternoon or evening hours. Many Catholics pray the rosary on their own, when alone. But the rosary is also an old family prayer. This specific family devotion has been supported be several popes including Pope Pius XII in his encyclical Ingruentium Malorum: 

*  The custom of the family recitation of the Holy Rosary is a most efficacious means. What a sweet sight - most pleasing to God - when, at eventide, the Christian home resounds with the frequent repetition of praises in honor of the High  Queen of Heaven! Then the Rosary, recited in the family, assembled before the image of the Virgin, in an admirable union of hearts, the parents and their children, who come back from their daily work. It unites them piously with those absent and those dead. It links all more tightly in a sweet bond of love, with the most Holy Virgin, who, like a loving mother, in the circle of her children, will be there bestowing upon them an abundance of the gifts of concord and family peace. <ref>Ingruentium Marlorum 13</ref>

==The Rosary Pope==
One of the forces that drove the spread of the rosary during the 19th century among Roman Catholics was the influence of the ''Rosary Pope'', a title given to Pope Leo XIII (1878-1903) because he issued a record eleven encyclicals on the rosary, instituted the Catholic custom of daily rosary prayer during the month of October, and  in 1883 created the Feast of ''Queen of the Holy Rosary''. <ref>in Lauretanische Litanei, Marienlexikon, Eos, St. Ottilien, 1988, p.41</ref>

Mariology being viewed as inherent in Christology, and the rosary paving that path.<ref>At the center of this mystery, in the midst of this wonderment of faith, stands Mary. As the loving Mother of the Redeemer, she was the first to experience it: "To the wonderment of nature you bore your Creator"! Pope John Paul II, in Redemptoris Mater, 51</ref><ref>See Pius XII ''Mystici corporis Christi''; John Henry Newman: ''Mariology is always christocentric'', in Michael Testa, Mary: The Virgin Mary in the Life and Writings of John Henry Newman 2001; ''Mariology Is Christology'' in Vittorio Messori, "The Mary Hypothesis" Rome, 2005</ref>

==Other forms of the Roman Catholic Rosary==
=== Paternosters ===
In Latin, the liturgical language of the Roman Catholic Church. In some Houses, lay brothers who did not understand Latin or who were illiterate were required to say the Lord's Prayer a certain number of times per day while meditating on the Mysteries of the Incarnation of Christ. Since there were 150 Psalms, this could number up to 150 times per day. To count these repetitions, they used beads strung upon a cord and this set of prayer beads became commonly known as a ''Pater noster'', which is the Latin for "Our Father". Lay people adopted this practice as a form of popular worship. The Paternoster could be of various lengths, but was often made up of 5 “decades” of 10 beads, which when performed three times made up 150 prayers. Other Paternosters, most notably those used by lay persons, may have had only had 10 beads, and may have also been highly ornamented. As the Rosary (ring of flowers) incorporating the Hail Mary prayer became more common, it was often still referred to as a Paternoster.

=== The Servite Rosary ===
In 1233, seven of the members of a Florentine Confraternity devoted to the Holy Mother of God were gathered in prayer under the presidency of Alessio Falconieri. According to tradition, Mary appeared to the young men and exhorted them to devote themselves to her service, in retirement from the world. They retired to the deserted slopes of Monte Senario near Florence, where they experienced another vision of Mary. There they formed a new Order called the Servants of Mary, or Servites, in recognition of their special manner of venerating Our Lady of Sorrows. The seven-"week" Servite Rosary is variously called the Servite Chaplet; Rosary of the Seven Dolors of the Blessed Virgin Mary; and the Seven Swords Rosary. A set of introductory prayers for the Servite Rosary was written by St. Alphonsus Liguori in his book ''The Glories of Mary''.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=7uwCAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA481&dq=five+decades+slowly+fifteen+hurry+little#PPA611,M1 Liguori, Alphonsus.
