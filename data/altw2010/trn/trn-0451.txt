'''VfL Bochum''' is a German football club based in Bochum, North Rhine-Westphalia. 
==History==
===Founding to World War II===
''VfL'' is one of the oldest sports organizations in Germany claiming an origin date of July 26, 1848 when an article in the ''Märkischer Sprecher'' - a local newspaper - called for the creation of a gymnastics club. The ''Bochumer Turnverein'' was then formally established with the authorities on February 18, 1849. However, the origin of the VfLs football department is the predecessor side of the ''Fußballklub 06'' formed in 1906, later known as ''SV Germania 06 Bochum''. 

Another ancestor - ''Spiel und Sport Bochum'' - was formed in 1908 and played the first football match at the ''Castroper Straße'' (Ruhrstadion) on October 8, 1911. After a merger with another local side in 1919, they took on the name ''TuS Bochum 1848''.

Two of these clubs played in the Gauliga Westfalen, one of sixteen top-flight divisions established through the re-organization of German football under the 39 season. After 1943 they played with yet another club as the combined wartime side ''Kriegsspielgemeinschaft (KSG) VfL 1848 Bochum/Preußen Bochum'' until the end of the conflict. Although the club was able to field competitive sides, they had the misfortune of playing in the same division as ''Schalke 04'' which was the dominant team of the era: ''Bochum'''s best results were a number of distant second place finishes.

===Postwar and entry to Bundesliga play===
Following the war the football section resumed play as the independent ''VfL Bochum Fussballgemeinschaft 1848'' and played its first season in the second division 2.Oberliga West in 61 season.

With the formation of the Bundesliga, Germany's new professional league, in 1963, ''VfL'' found itself in the third tier Amateurliga Westfalen. A first place result there in 1965 raised them to the Regionalliga West (II) from where they began a steady climb up the league table to the Bundesliga in 1971. During this rise ''Bochum'' also played its way to the final of the 1968 German Cup where they dropped a 1:4 decision to ''1. FC Köln''.

In spite of being a perennial lower table side, ''Bochum'' developed a reputation for tenaciousness on the field in a run of twenty seasons at the top flight. The club made a repeat appearance in the German Cup final in 2.Bundesliga. The club's best Bundesliga results have come relatively recently as 5th place finishes in 1997 and 2004, which earned them appearances in the UEFA Cup tournament. In 1997, they advanced to the third round where they were put out by Dutch side ''Ajax Amsterdam'', and in 2004, they were eliminated early through away goals (0-0 and 1-1) by ''Standard CL Liège'' of Belgium.

===Current===
Today's sports club has 5,000 members with the football department accounting for over 2,200 of these. Other sections now part of the association include athletics, handball, hockey, swimming, table tennis, tennis, and volleyball.
