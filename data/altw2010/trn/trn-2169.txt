'''José Raúl Capablanca y Graupera''', kubanski New York, ZDA.

Capablanca, svetovni šahovski prvak (od 1921 do 1927). Najbolj znan je bil po svojem bliskovitem in natančnem ocenjevanju šahovskih položajev in še danes velja za enega največjih šahovskih talentov ter strokovnjakov za šahovske končnice. Odlično se je znašel tudi v zapletenih taktičnih postavitvah.

državnega šahovskega prvaka Juana Corzo. Tudi kasneje se v svoji karieri na šahovske partije ni posebno pripravljal, uspešno se je zanašal na svoj naravni šahovski dar. Veljal je tudi za strastnega osvajalca ženskih src, kar slikovito ponazarja naslednja anekdota:<br>
Dr. Milan Vidmar si je ogledoval šahovske partije v dvorani potem, ko je sam končal svojo pred ostalimi. Pri neki mizi je opazil italijanskega velemojstra, ki je sam sedel pred šahovnico, nasproti pa je stal samo stol, čez katerega je bil položen Capablancov plašč. Vidmar je pohitel v bližnji bar, kjer je našel Capablanco, ki je medtem osvajal neko dekle. ''»Gospod Capablanca, šahovska ura vam že 20 minut teče!«'' ga zaskrbljeno opomni Vidmar. ''»Ali je moj plašč še tam?«'', ga vpraša Capablanca. ''»Da,«'' mu začudeno odvrne Vidmar. ''»No, to je povsem dovolj za mojega nasprotnika,«'' se mu nasmehne Capablanca in se zopet posveti svoji izbranki. Partijo je kasneje gladko dobil.

Aljehin je ob smrti Capablance zapisal: »Z njegovo smrtjo smo izgubili šahovskega genija, kakršnega ne bo nikdar več.«

V svoji celotni šahovski karieri je izgubil manj kot 50 partij. Med leti 1916 in 1923 je odigral 63 partij, od katerih ni izgubil niti ene - nepremagan je ostal kar osem let.

Capablanca je napovedal, da bo šah v sedanji obliki v prihodnosti izumrl zaradi neprestanih šestih šahovskih figur z dodatnima dvema različnima trdnjava in skakač, druga pa kot lovec in skakač.

'''José Raúl Capablanca y Graupera''' (greatest chess player of all time.

== Childhood ==
right|thumb|300px|Capablanca

Referred to by many chess historians as the Mozart of chess, Capablanca was a chess prodigy whose brilliance was noted at an early age. Richard Réti said about him "Chess was his mother tongue".

According to Capablanca, he learned the rules of the game at the age of four by watching his father play. He said he noticed his father make an illegal move with his knight, accused him of cheating, and then demonstrated what he had done. Capablanca was taken to the queen odds and defeated a leading player, but his level of play was astonishing for a four year old, even given the queen odds.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1481959 Ramon Iglesias vs Jose Raul Capablanca] ChessGames.com</ref> In December 1901, just turned 13, he defeated the leading Cuban player, Juan Corzo, by the score of four wins, three losses, and six draws. But later in April 1902 he only came fourth in the National Championship. Capablanca later began a semester as an undergraduate student of chemical engineering at Columbia University in New York City, but did not complete it, and chess became his profession.

== Early adult career ==
In 1909, at the age of 20, Capablanca won a match against US champion Frank Marshall by +8-1=14. This was a comparable margin to Marshall's World Championship loss (+8-0=7) to Emanuel Lasker in 1907. 

Capablanca won the New York 1911, Capablanca placed second, with 9½/12, half a point behind Marshall, and half a point ahead of Charles Jaffe and Oscar Chajes. Marshall insisted that Capablanca should be allowed to play in a tournament at San Sebastián, Spain in 1911. It was one of the strongest tournaments of the time. All of the world's leading players except world champion Emanuel Lasker were in attendance. At the beginning of the tournament Ossip Bernstein and Aron Nimzowitsch objected to Capablanca's presence because he had not won a major tournament. But after Capablanca won his first round game against Bernstein, capturing the tournament's brilliancy prize,<ref></ref> Bernstein quickly acknowledged Capablanca's talent and said that he would not be surprised if Capablanca won the tournament. Nimzowitsch took offense when Capablanca made a comment while watching one of his blitz games, and remarked that unproven players should hold their tongue in the presence of their betters. Capablanca quickly challenged Nimzowitsch to a series of fast games, which he won "with ridiculous ease." The assembled masters soon concluded that Capablanca had no equal at fast chess, a distinction which was to remain his until virtually the end of his life. Capablanca went on to win his tournament game with Nimzowitsch as well, using an opening setup much admired by Mikhail Botvinnik.<ref></ref> By tournament's end, Capablanca had astounded the chess world by taking first place at San Sebastián, with a score of +6 -1 =7, ahead of Akiba Rubinstein, Carl Schlechter and Siegbert Tarrasch. The one game he lost was against Rubinstein, one of the most brilliant chess creations of the latter's career.

== World title contender ==
thumb|200px|Capablanca

In 1911, Capablanca challenged Emanuel Lasker for the world championship. Lasker accepted his challenge but proposed seventeen conditions for the match. Capablanca disapproved of some of the conditions and the match did not take place. Capablanca won the New York National tournament of 1912 with 11/13, half a point ahead of Marshall.<ref>http://www.chessmetrics.com, Capablanca player file</ref>

In 1913, Capablanca played in his hometown of Havana where he came in second to Frank Marshall, with 10/14. He lost one of their individual games after having a much better position.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1001096 Jose Raul Capablanca vs Frank James Marshall] ChessGames.com</ref> Soltis, Andy, ''Frank Marshall, United States Chess Champion'', p.213, McFarland, 1994.</ref>

Then Capablanca scored +13 -0 =0 in a 1913 tournament in New York (Rice), although one of only a handful of perfect scores ever in high-level chess tournaments.
Capablanca was again perfect in a second tournament at Havana 1913 with 9/9.<ref name="autogenerated4">http://www.chessmetrics.com, Capablanca player file.</ref>

In September 1913, Capablanca secured a job in the Cuban Foreign Office. He appears not to have had any specific duties other than playing chess, but what he had he was reported to have carried out conscientiously. For many years, he was the most famous Cuban alive.

In October 1913 to March 1914 Capablanca traveled to Europe on his way to the Consulate at St Petersburg to play matches or exhibition games against their leading masters. In serious games, he scored nineteen wins, four draws, and one loss during that period. First, he defeated hanging pawns.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1261680 Ossip Bernstein vs Jose Raul Capablanca] ChessGames.com</ref> In Kiev, he won among others against Fedor Bogatyrchuk. Then in Vienna he won one game from Richard Réti and defeated Savielly Tartakower 1½-½. Capablanca also gave many simultaneous exhibitions noted for their speed and very high winning scores.

At the great 1914 tournament in St. Petersburg, with most of the world's leading players (except those of the Austro-Hungarian empire), Capablanca met the great Emanuel Lasker across the chessboard for the first time in normal tournament play (Capablanca had won a knock-out lightning chess final game in 1906, leading to a famous joint endgame composition). Capablanca took the large lead of one and a half points in the preliminary rounds, and made Lasker fight hard to draw.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1258183 Jose Raul Capablanca vs Emanuel Lasker]ChessGames.com</ref><ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1258182 Jose Raul Capablanca vs Emanuel Lasker]ChessGames.com</ref> He again won the first brilliancy prize against Bernstein <ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1260576 Jose Raul Capablanca vs Ossip Bernstein] ChessGames.com</ref> and had some highly regarded wins against David Janowsky,<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1064762 Jose Raul Capablanca vs David Janowski]ChessGames.com</ref> Nimzowitsch,<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1102386 Aron Nimzowitsch vs Jose Raul Capablanca]ChessGames.com</ref> and Alekhine.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1011923 Alexander Alekhine vs Jose Raul Capablanca] ChessGames.com</ref>

However, Capablanca fell victim to a comeback by Lasker in the second stage of the tournament, including a famous victory by Lasker.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1258181 Emanuel Lasker vs Jose Raul Capablanca] ChessGames.com</ref> Capablanca finished second to Grandmasters of Chess".

Alekhine reports:

:His real, incomparable gifts first began to make themselves known at the time of St. Petersburg, 1914, when I too came to know him personally.  Neither before nor afterwards have I seen — and I cannot imagine as well — such a flabbergasting quickness of chess comprehension as that possessed by the Capablanca of that epoch.  Enough to say that he gave ''all'' the St. Petersburg masters the odds of 5–1 in quick games — and won!  With all this he was always good-humoured, the darling of the ladies, and enjoyed wonderful good health — really a dazzling appearance.  That he came second to Lasker must be entirely ascribed to his youthful levity — he was already playing as well as Lasker.<ref name="autogenerated1">Alekhine, A., tribute to Capablanca, pp. 157–158, in: Alekhine, A., ''107 Great Chess Battles'', tr. E.G. Winter, Oxford University Press, 1980.</ref>

In short, Capablanca was unrivaled as a fast chess player, even by the very best players of his own time (and perhaps of later times as well)<ref>[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3455 Computers choose: who was the strongest player?]ChessBase.com</ref>.

== Wartime years ==
Marshall Attack variation of the Ruy Lopez for the first time. Capablanca accepted the gambit and went on to win the game; it was later rumored that Marshall had analyzed the line for ten years before using it. This variation remains popular among top Grandmasters of the present day, nearly 90 years later.

== World Champion ==
In 1919, Capablanca overwhelmed the strong Serbian Hastings 1919 Victory tournament with a dominant 10½/11, a point ahead of Kostic.<ref name="autogenerated4" />

In 1920, Lasker saw that Capablanca was becoming too strong, and resigned the title to him, saying, "You have earned the title not by the formality of a challenge, but by your brilliant mastery." Capablanca wanted to win it in a match, but Lasker insisted that he was now the challenger. They played a match in Havana in 1921, and Capablanca defeated Lasker +4 -0 =10. This feat of winning the world title without losing a game to the incumbent went unequaled for almost eight decades, until Vladimir Kramnik's win over Garry Kasparov +2 -0 =13 in 2000.

The new world champion, Capablanca dominated the field at London, 1922, with 13/15, ahead of Alexander Alekhine (11½), Milan Vidmar (11), and Akiba Rubinstein (10½).<ref>http://chessmetrics.com, the Capablanca player file.</ref> There was an increasing number of strong chess players and it was felt that the world champion should not be able to evade challenges to his title, as had been done in the past. At this tournament, some of the leading players of the time, including Alexander Alekhine, Efim Bogoljubov, Geza Maroczy, Richard Reti, Akiba Rubinstein, Savielly Tartakower and Milan Vidmar, met to discuss rules for the conduct of future world championships. Amongst other things, one of the conditions proposed by Capablanca was that the challenger would have to raise at least ten thousand dollars for the prize money. These were the so-called 'London Rules'. That same year, Capablanca gave a simultaneous exhibition against 103 opponents, the largest in history up to that time, and scored 102 wins and 1 draw, losing none.

In the following years, Rubinstein and Nimzowitsch challenged Capablanca, but were unable to raise the stipulated funds. Alekhine's subsequent challenge, in 1927, was backed by a group of Argentinian businessmen and the president of Argentina who guaranteed the funds.

Capablanca was second, with 14½ points, behind Lasker's 16, at the elite New York 1924 tournament, one of the greatest ever staged, and again ahead of third-placed Alekhine. In this tournament, his loss to Reti was his first in eight years. His performance was still a superb 2792. At Moscow 1925, Capablanca scored 13½ for third place, behind Efim Bogoljubov (15½) and Emanuel Lasker (14). Capablanca won at Lake Hopatcong 1926 with 6/8, ahead of Abraham Kupchik (5) and Geza Maroczy (4½). <ref>http://www.chessmetrics.com, the Capablanca player file.</ref>

As World Champion, Capablanca also underwent major changes in his personal life. In December 1921, he married Gloria Simoni Betancourt. They had a son, José Raúl Jr., in 1923 and a daughter, Gloria, in 1925, but the marriage ended in divorce.  Both his parents died during his reign, his father in 1923 and mother in 1926.<ref>Winter, ''Capablanca'', ch. 5: 
"Champion", 1989.</ref>

== Losing the title ==
right|thumb|Alekhine vs. Capablanca
Capablanca had overwhelming success at round robin with six of the world's top players. He was undefeated, with 14/20, and 2½ points ahead of the second-placed Alexander Alekhine. Capablanca also defeated Alekhine in their first game,<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1012524 Alexander Alekhine vs Jose Raul Capablanca, New York 1927]</ref> won the first brilliancy prize against Rudolf Spielmann,<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1007840 Jose Raul Capablanca vs Rudolf Spielmann, New York 1927]</ref> and won two games against Nimzowitsch.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1007807 Aron Nimzowitsch vs Jose Raul Capablanca, New York 1927]</ref><ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1007846 Aron Nimzowitsch vs Jose Raul Capablanca, New York 1927]</ref>

This made him the clear favorite for his match with Alekhine, who had never defeated him, later that year. However, the challenger had prepared well, played with patience and solidity, and the marathon match, held at Buenos Aires, proved to be Capablanca's undoing. Capablanca lost the first game in very lackluster fashion,<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1012486 Capablanca-Alekhine World Championship Match 1927]</ref> then took a narrow lead by winning games 3 <ref>http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1012490</ref> and 7<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1012487 Capablanca-Alekhine World Championship Match 1927]</ref> — attacking games more in the style of Alekhine — but then lost games 11 <ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1270221 Capablanca-Alekhine World Championship Match 1927]</ref> and 12.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1012498 Alexander Alekhine vs Jose Raul Capablanca Capablanca-Alekhine World Championship Match 1927]</ref> He tried to get Alekhine to annul the match when both players were locked in a series of draws. Alekhine refused, and eventually prevailed +6 -3 =25.

In a tribute to Capablanca after his death, Alekhine wrote:

:How did it happen that he lost to me?  I must confess that even now I cannot answer that question with certainty, since in 1927 I did not believe that I was superior to him.  Perhaps the chief reason for his defeat was his over-estimation of his own powers arising out of his overwhelming victory at New York 1927, and his underestimation of mine.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Alekhine refused to play a return match, even though doing so had been a pre-condition of the match. Despite the collapse of the financial markets in 1929, Alekhine continued to insist on the London conditions, with a $10,000 purse to be secured by the challenger. Capablanca found it difficult to satisfy this condition, because the world's economy was mired in what became known as the Edward Winter explored this failed rematch situation further on chessbase.com in 2007. Instead, Alekhine played two matches against Efim Bogoljubov, a fine player, but one who posed no great threat in a long match (Capablanca had a 5-0 lifetime record against him). Throughout Alekhine's first tenure as champion (1927-1935), he refused to play in the same tournaments as Capablanca, and indeed was able to prevent Capablanca's participation in events which Alekhine himself wanted to play.<ref name="FineLessons">Reuben Fine.

== Post-championship ==
After Capablanca lost the title, he won a number of strong tournaments, hoping that his showing would force Alekhine to grant him a rematch, but it was not to be. Capablanca won at Stockholm 1928 with 4/4, ahead of Erik Lundin and Gosta Stoltz.
At the very strong Bad Kissingen 1928 tournament, with nine of the world's top 14 players, Capablanca placed second with 7/11, behind Efim Bogolyubov.
Capablanca won at Budapest 1928 with 7/9, with Frank Marshall one point behind.
At Berlin 1928, Capablanca again triumphed over a field which had seven of the top 13, with a powerful 9½/13, 2½ points ahead of runner-up Aron Nimzowitsch.

From 1929 to 1931, Capablanca maintained his exceptional standard, with seven tournaments played, resulting in five first places, one second place, and one shared second/third place. At Ramsgate 1929, Capablanca claimed first with 5½/7, ahead of Akiba Rubinstein and Vera Menchik. Then at Carlsbad 1929, one of the great tournaments in chess history, with 14 of the top 17 competing, Capablanca shared second/third places with Rudolph Spielmann on 14½/21, half a point behind Aron Nimzowitsch. Capablanca dominated a middle-range field at Barcelona 1929 with 13½/14, two points ahead of runner-up Savielly Tartakower. At Budapest 1929, Capablanca won with 10½/13 , a point ahead of Akiba Rubinstein. Capablanca won at Hastings 1929-30 with 6½/9, ahead of Milan Vidmar and Frederick Yates. At Hastings 1930-31, Capablanca finished second with 6½/9, half a point behind Max Euwe. Then at New York 1931, Capablanca won with an excellent 10/11, 1½ points ahead of Isaac Kashdan.<ref></ref>
Also in 1931, Capablanca defeated the outstanding Dutch player Max Euwe, who was ranked #6 in the world, according to chessmetrics.com ratings, in a match at Amsterdam by 6-4 (+2 -0 =8).

== Withdrawal, then resumption ==
Then he withdrew from serious chess, and played only less serious games at the simultaneous displays. Reuben Fine recalls that in this period he (Fine) could fight on almost level terms with Alekhine at blitz chess, but that Capablanca beat him "mercilessly" the few times they played. On 6 December 1933, Capa scored 9/9 in a strong blitz tournament where Samuel Reshevsky and Fine tied for second with Milton Hanauer two points behind.<ref>http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter30.html#4817._Capablancas_clean_sweep</ref>

In 1934, Capablanca resumed serious play. He had begun dating Olga Chеgodaeva (Russian: Ольга Чегодаева), whom he eventually married in 1938, and she inspired him to play again. Capablanca's first event in more than three years was Nottingham 1936, with 10/14, ahead of Euwe, Lasker, Alekhine, and the leading young players Reuben Fine, Samuel Reshevsky (avenging a defeat here) and Salo Flohr.

This was Capablanca's first game with Alekhine since their great match, and the Cuban did not miss his chance to avenge that defeat.<ref>http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1008348</ref> He had the worse position, but caught Alekhine in such a deep trap, luring him into giving up three pieces for two rooks, that none of the other players could work out where Alekhine had gone wrong except for Lasker, who immediately saw the mistake. Capablanca recounted this episode in ''Capablanca's Legacy: Capablanca's Last Chess Lectures'', pp. 111–112, expressing his admiration for Lasker's insight even in his sixties. But Capablanca did not mention that his opponent was Alekhine. Their feud was still intense, so they were never seen seated together at the board for more than a few seconds. Each man made his move and then got up and walked around.
