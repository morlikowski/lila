'''Will Power''' (born March 1, 1981 in Toowoomba, Queensland) is an Australian motorsport driver, who currently competes in the IndyCar Series.

He won the 2002 Australian Drivers' Championship<ref> [http://www.camsmanual.com.au/pdf/records/1402_CAMS_Gold_Star_Q108.pdf CAMS Online Manual of Motor Sport]</ref> by winning 7 times and achieving 3 pole positions.<ref>[http://www.f4000.com/thecars.htm The Series - The Cars] Australian Formula 4000 Championship</ref>

Power started his career driver a 15 year old Formula Ford car in the Australian Formula Ford championship.
He tested a Minardi Formula One car in 2004 with fellow Australian Will Davison in Italy.

During Australian team in the 2005-06 Team Brazil.

In late 2005 he joined Champ Car Team Australia at the Lexmark Indy 300 event at Surfers Paradise in Australia, which also resulted in his departure from the World Series by Renault championship even though that season was still in progress and Power ultimately ended seventh in the championship.<ref>[http://www.speedsportmag.de/racing/statresults.php?sprache=en&back=formulanissan&sid=173 2005 Formula Renault 3.5 World Series Complete Qualifying and Race Results] SpeedSport Magazine</ref>  In the Indy 300 Power ran strongly until being knocked off the track by team mate Alex Tagliani.  After the Surfers Paradise event he signed a multi year contract to race for the team, which began immediately at the next Champ Car round in Mexico City after Tagliani's teammate Marcus Marshall was released for what was described as a "serious breach of contract".

Power drove full time for Team Australia in 2006.  He performed well throughout the season with nine top ten finishes and strong qualifying results.  At Mexico, the final round of the season, Power took his first podium finish in Champ Car. He won the "rookie of the year" award<ref>[http://www.champcarworldseries.com/Results/Awards.asp 2006 Roshfrans Rookie Of The Year Standings] Champ Car World Series</ref> and finished in 6th place in the championship standings.

In his home race in 2006, at Surfers Paradise in Australia, he scored his first pole position of his career in Champ Cars, in front of his home crowd. However, contact from Paul Tracy in pit lane and then an ambitious overtaking move by Sébastien Bourdais resulted in a bent left steering arm, and he fell to the back, one lap down by the time the car was repaired, eventually finishing 12th.<ref></ref>

On 8 April 2007, Power won his first Champ Car race at the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix, held in the streets of Las Vegas. He qualified on pole position and led most laps, becoming the first Australian driver to win in the series. On July 8th, at the Steelback Grand Prix of Toronto, with rain pouring down and visibility near zero when he got behind other cars, Will Power decided it was time to get aggressive. The Australian drove from fourth to first in 14 laps, finally splashing past rookie Ryan Dalziel to take the lead with 23 minutes to go, and went on to an easy victory.

To get to the lead, Power also had to pass three-time Champ Car World Series champion Sebastien Bourdais and rookie Neel Jani. Thanks to a series of late caution flags, he was able to go after each of them in turn. "I was close behind Sebastien and I knew he was quite tentative in the wet and I attacked him," Power said. "I got him on a restart. Then the next restart, I got Neel and the next restart, I got Dalziel. It's just about being aggressive at the right time and not hitting anyone". "I just drove so hard here because we've just had so much bad luck in the last few races," said Power, whose first Champ Car victory came in the 2007 opener in Las Vegas. "I didn't care; I just went hard. The car was good in the wet. It was good in the dry, and we stuck it to them." Power had podium finishes at Long Beach, Mont-Tremblant and Mexico City and pole positions at Houston, Edmonton, Surfers Paradise and Mexico City to place fourth in the final point standings in 2007.

The merger of Champ Car and the IRL left his future uncertain. Unrelated to this, his Walker Racing team announced they would not be making the switch from Champ Car to IRL due to lack of sponsorship.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/racing/wires/03/09/3010.ap.car.irl.open.wheel.merger.walker.1st.ld.writethru.0225/ Walker Racing won't be making switch from Champ Car to IndyCar Series], Associated Press, March 9, 2008</ref>.

'''Will Power''' (né le  1981 à Toowoomba, Australie) est un pilote automobile australien. Il évolue depuis 2005 dans le championnat Champ Car.

==Biographie==
Vainqueur du championnat de Formule Holden en 2002 (équivalent australien de la Formule 3000), Will Power rejoint l'Europe en 2003, d'abord dans le championnat britannique de Formule 3, puis dans le championnat de World Series by Renault en 2005. Malgré plusieurs succès, et malgré un test en Formule 1 fin 2004 sur une Minardi à l'initiative de son compatriote Paul Stoddart, les portes de la discipline reine restent closes pour l'espoir australien.

Fin 2005, il est invité par l'écurie de Champ Car Team Australia a disputer l'avant-dernière manche de la saison en Australie dans les rues de Surfer's Paradise. Malgré un abandon, le niveau de compétitivité de Power impressionne et lui vaut d'être reconduit pour la manche suivante au Mexique, et de décrocher un contrat à temps plein pour la saison 2006. Au sein d'une écurie qui n'est pas réputée pour être l'une des meilleures du plateau, Power multiplie les coups d'éclat en qualification, et fait preuve d'une belle régularité en course, récompensée en fin d'année par un podium à Mexico.  Sixième du classement final du championnat 2006, il est récompensé par le titre de meilleur débutant de l'année.
