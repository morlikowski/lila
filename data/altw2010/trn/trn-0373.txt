'''Torquay''' ist eine Stadt an der Südküste von Grafschaft Devon an der sogenannten "Englischen Riviera" gelegen. Torquay bildet seit 1997 zusammen mit Paignton und Brixham die selbständige Gebietskörperschaft (Unitary Authority) '''Torbay''' an der westlichen Seite der Lyme Bay im Südwesten Englands. Die Einwohnerzahl Torquays beträgt 62.963 (Stand: 2001), Torbay insgesamt hat im Jahr 2007 etwa 132.000 Einwohner.

== Stadtbild ==
Im 19. Jahrhundert wurde Torquay ein populärer Küstenerholungsort, berühmt für ein gesundes Klima. Da der Wind, geologisch bedingt, nie aus Norden oder Westen kommt, ist das Klima sehr mild und für englische Verhältnisse recht trocken und selten neblig. So schickte man Anfang des 19. Jahrhunderts Menschen mit Atemwegserkrankungen nach Torquay. Mit dem Bau der Eisenbahn im Jahr 1844 wurde Torquay ein mittelgrosser Ort. Vor allem die Familien ''Cary'' und ''Palk'', nach denen heute die Straßen ''Cary Parade'' und ''Palk Street'' im Hafen von Torquay benannt sind, sorgten mit dem Anlegen von Terrassen und dem Bau von hellen, südländisch wirkenden Häusern an den steilen Hängen für das Image, welches Torquay bekam: Torquay wurde auch als "The English Montpellier" und "The English Naples" ("Das englische Neapel") bezeichnet. Im Gegensatz zur weit verbreiteten Vorstellung über England ist es in dieser Region weder regnerisch noch oft neblig oder kalt: an der Südspitze Englands herrscht beinahe mediterranes Klima; viele Palmen in den Gärten und Parks bezeugen dies. 

Torquay ist, so sagen die Einwohner, "built on seven hills", auf 7 Hügeln gebaut. In Wirklichkeit sind es etwa 40: Ash Hill, Barton Hill, Braddons Hill, Bronshill, Broomhill, Crown Hill, Dairy Hill, Exe Hill, Giant Hill, Great Hill, Huxtable Hill, Lincombe Slopes, Livermead Hill, Locks Hill, Mincent Hill, Oak Hill, Oddicombe Beach Hill, Old Woods Hill, Parkhill, Pennys Hill, Petit Tor Hill, Reddenhill, Redgate Heights, Rosehill, Roundhill, Shedden Hill, Sherwell Hill, Stentiford Hill, Sunbury Hill,Thurlow Hill, Tor Hill, Trinity Hill, Upton Hill, Vane Hill, Walls Hill, Warren Hill, Watcombe Heights, Westhill und Windmill Hill.

'''Torquay''' () is a town in the unitary authority of Torbay and ceremonial county of Devon, England.

It lies 16 miles (26 kilometres) south of largest city in the United Kingdom with a population only slightly less than that of Brighton, which was granted city status in 2000.  During the peak summer season the resort's population swells to around 200,000 <ref><cite>The New English Riviera, The Mayor's Vision For A New Torbay, Torbay Council Publication, 2007</cite></ref>

The town's economy was initially based upon fishing and agriculture as in the case of Victorian society as the town's fame spread. Renowned for its healthful climate, the town earned the nickname of the English Riviera and favourable comparisons to Montpellier.

Torquay's name originates in it being the quay of the ancient village of Torre. In turn, Torre takes its name from the tor, the extensively quarried remains of which can be seen by the town's Tor Hill Road.<ref>Percy Russell, <cite>A History Of Torquay</cite> (Torquay: Devonshire Press Limited, 1960), 7-8</ref>

==History==

The area comprising modern Torquay has been inhabited since paleolithic times. Hand axes found in Kents Cavern date to 450,000 years ago, and a maxilla fragment known as Kents Cavern 4 may be the oldest example of a modern human in Europe.<ref>John R. Pike, ''Torquay'' (Torquay: Torbay Borough Council Printing Services, 1994), 5-6</ref><ref>{{cite web

Roman soldiers are known to have visited Torquay at some point during the period when Britain was a part of the Roman Empire, leaving offerings at a strange rock formation in Kent's Cavern, known as 'The Face'. No evidence has been found of Roman settlement in the area; however, evidence of Roman settlement has been found in nearby Totnes and given the proximity of Exeter, it is possible there may have been some small scale Roman settlement in the area.

The first major building in what was to become Torquay was Torre Abbey, a Premonstratensian monastery founded in 1196.<ref>Russell, 19</ref><ref>Pike, 6</ref> Torquay remained a minor settlement until the Napoleonic wars, when Torbay was frequently used as a sheltered anchorage by the Channel Fleet, and relatives of officers often visited Torquay. The mild climate of Torquay attracted many visitors who considered the town a convalescence retreat where they could recover from illness away from the cold winters of more Northerly or Easterly locations. The population of Torquay grew rapidly from 838 in 1801, to 11,474 in 1851.

The second phase in the expansion of Torquay began when Torre railway station was opened on 18 December 1848. The improved transport connections resulted in the rapid growth of Torquay at the expense of nearby towns not on Isambard Kingdom Brunel's railways.

During King George V and Queen Mary visited. After the war had ended, Great Western Railway launched an advertising campaign to attract tourists to Torquay, and this helped the town grow to a major South coast resort.

During evacuees from the London area, the town did however suffer minor bomb damage during the war, mainly from planes dumping excess loads after participating in the Plymouth Blitz. The last air raid on Torquay took place on 29 May 1944 shortly before the D-Day landings in June and in the months leading up to D-Day thousands of US Army personnel arrived in Torquay with the 3204th Quartermaster Service Company being billeted in Chelston and Cockington. During Operation Overlord more than 23,000 men of the American 4th Infantry Division would depart Torquay for Utah Beach.

The water sport events of the 1948 Summer Olympics were held in Torquay, with the Olympic flame being brought from London to Torre Abbey Gardens.<ref>Russell, 199</ref>. Although it will not host any Olympic events for the 2012 Summer Olympics, with the sailing taking place in Weymouth, Torbay is looking to host teams as a preparation camp.

Since World War II, the nature of tourism in the United Kingdom has changed significantly. Increasing wealth has meant that holidays abroad are now commonplace, and coastal towns are now more popular for short stays as part of a touring holiday. Recently Torquay has seen an increase in foreign visitors, and is now a major destination for foreign exchange students.

==Governance==
Torquay is part of left|thumb|150px|Torbay Constituency Historically part of the county of Devon, Torbay was made a unitary authority on April 1 1998 making it responsible for its own affairs. For local elections the district is divided into 11 wards, 7 of them in Torquay.

Torbay Council is headed by the first directly elected mayor in the South West region, Conservative candidate Nicholas Bye becoming the first mayor elected under this system in October 2005, under an electoral system which was later described as "a total failure", Bye receiving votes from fewer than 7% of the electorate.<ref>{{cite web

After the election, Bye noted the general apathy towards the concept displayed during the election, stating: "it is quite clear from canvassing that a lot of people did not want an elected mayor."

Torquay, Paignton and Brixham are in the Torbay parliamentary constituency, created in 1974. The constituency elects one Member of Parliament; currently Liberal Democrat). Torquay, the rest of South West England, and Gibraltar are in the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

==Geography==
Torquay is situated on the South West coast of England, forming one third of Torbay, and is primarily on the western side of the bay. It has a mild Cabbage trees, also nicknamed 'Torbay Palms' are a notable feature of the area, the trees were introduced into the area in 1820 from New Zealand and since then have flourished, There are currently thousands throughout the town and they contribute significantly to the more Mediterranean than English feel the town has.
thumb|right|The various regions that make up the town of Torquay and their approximate extent.)
The town is made up of a number of regions that over the years amalgamated into the town of Torquay. The town's historic core consists of the regions of Tormohun, Wellswood, The Warberries, Upton and Ellacombe and is based upon what was once the holdings of the Palk family. In 1900 the regions of Chelston and Livermead, previously part of the Cockington estate owned by the Mallocks were annexed by the town and this was swiftly followed by the absorption of the former borough of Saint Marychuch into the town. In this period Saint Marychurch consisted of more than just present day Saint Marychurch but also the regions of Plainmoor, Watcombe and Babbacombe. Finally in 1928 the Mallocks' last holdings in Cockington were integrated within the town borders. Torquay continued to expand throughout the century leading to the development of Shiphay, Hele Village, Barton and most recently from the 1990s until present day, The Willows giving the town its current layout.

Torquay is also set along a coastline renowned for its beaches, having nine popular beaches. The high standards of water quality and beach facilities mean that many carry coveted awards, including no fewer than three European Blue Flags - more than any other resort in the UK. The main beaches of Torquay are as follows:
* Maidencombe Beach
* Watcombe Beach
* Oddicombe Beach
* Babbacombe Beach
* Anstey's Cove
* Meadfoot Beach
* Torre Abbey Sands
* Corbyn Sands

The town is also noticeable for being the terminus of the Sticklepath Fault line, which runs through the rocks of Devon from Barnstaple Bay to Torquay resulting in infrequent mild earthquakes, the last of which were felt in the 1990s. The fault line emerges in the cliff face which forms part of Rock Walk before going out into the bay itself. On the Rock Walk side is Devonian Limestone on which Warren Road and Fleet Street stand. The other side of the fault line which runs down Belgrave Road is the red sandstone on which Torre Abbey stands, the fault can reach widths up to 500 metres in places.

==Transport==
thumb|left|Transport in Torquay - the railway (black, with Torre and Torquay stations marked), A380 (green), A3022 and A379 (red), and B3199 (yellow)

Torquay has two railway stations. Torquay railway station is situated near the sea, close to Torre Abbey Sands. Torre railway station is situated a little inland adjacent to the road leading to Newton Abbot. Not all trains stop at Torre.

Torquay is connected to the UK A38 and then on to the M5 at Riviera Way, to the seafront as Newton Road and then Avenue Road, and then on to Paignton as Torbay Road. The A379 runs past the harbour to the Babbacombe and St Marychurch areas of Torquay, and then north along the coast to Teignmouth. Two bus routes operated by Stagecoach Devon pass through Torquay - the 'Bayline' number 12 service between Newton Abbot and Brixham, and the X46 service between Exeter and Paignton - while other routes operate within the town.<ref>{{cite web

==Economy==
Unemployment in Torquay is high at 6.8% - this compares with 3.9% for Devon, and 5.0% for England as a whole.<ref>Office for National Statistics, "Table CAS021: Economic activity by sex and limiting long-term illness" in ''United Kingdom Census 2001'' (London: Office for National Statistics, 2001)</ref>

Many locals were employed in the Pontins holiday centre before it was sold off.

Torquay is also the home of Beverage Brands, the owners of the popular and controversial alcoholic brand, WKD, and was the home of Suttons Seeds until it relocated to the neighbouring town of Paignton in 1998.

===Tourism===

Torquay has numerous tourist attractions, including Britain's most important The Rev. J. McEnery explored the cave between 1825 and 1829 and put forth the coexistence theory. The cave was extensively explored from 1865 to 1880 by King George V and left|thumb|Living Coasts -->

Living Coasts, another popular attraction, is built on Beacon Quay which has existed since 1680. In 1857 the Bath's Saloons complex was built on the promontory overlooking Beacon Cove. This included a ballroom, concert hall and sunlit conservatory and private bathing facilities with, underneath, a large public swimming bath open to the sea. The stone arches of this public bath can still be seen today and have been incorporated into the shop at Living Coasts. Development of the site as a marine animal exhibit was first proposed in the early part of 1999 in response to a call from Torbay Borough Council for submissions from interested parties. The project, developed by Kay Elliott architects, included an exhibit to house marine birds, rather than fish, due to the need to avoid duplicating the exhibits at the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth. The project was subsequently taken on by Paignton Zoo Environmental Park and named Living Coasts.

Another attraction is the Babbacombe Model Village which opened in 1963. It is considered one of the best examples of a model village in England.

The Princess Theatre is a popular venue in the town.
