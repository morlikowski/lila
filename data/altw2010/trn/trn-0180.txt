'''Samuel Zborowski''' (?–Polish military commander and a notable member of the ''szlachta'' (Polish landed gentry). He is best remembered for having been executed by supporters of the Polish king; an event which caused much uproar among the contemporary Polish nobility.

==Biography==

Son of Jan, Krzysztof and Piotr, Samuel was an heir of a significant fortune within Poland. His family was notable for its wealth and influence at the royal court of Poland, his father was a castellan of Kraków and his brother Jan was a personal secretary of the king Sigismund II of Poland and one of the most influential people of the epoch.

Samuel Zborowski rose to the power of a Royal ''gauntlet as the first knight, yet his proposal of a fight was not responded by any respectable nobleman. Instead, the goblet was raised by certain Karwat, one of non-noble soldiers of the castellan of Wojnice Jan Tęczyński. After Karwat defeated Zborowski's servant in a duel, Zborowski felt this as a serious offence and attacked Tęczyński himself, in the presence of a new monarch. Castellan of Przemyśl Andrzej Wapowski tried to calm down the fighters, but was hit with Zborowski's mace and was badly hurt. Wapowski refused to rest and instead started a campaign against Zborowski; his wound got infected and he died a week later. Although a murder committed during a Sejm (Polish parliament) or in presence of a monarch was punishable by death, the new king did not want to start conflicts with the mighty family of Zborowski and sentenced him to banishment, without infamy.

Samuel Zborowski fled Poland even before the verdict was presented and joined the court of Andrzej and Krzysztof started to plot with the courts of Moscow and Vienna against the life of the monarch. Samuel tried to rehabilitate himself by raising a Cossack regiment and taking part in the war against Muscovy and the Velikiye Luki (Wielkie Łuki) Campaign of 1580, where he proven to be a courageous warrior. However, the sentence was not changed and the Zborowskis received no reward or recognition for their efforts. Samuel then moved to Dzikie Pola region where he was a celebrity among the Cossacks; together they carried several raids against the Ottoman Empire, angering king Batory, who wanted to pursue a policy of appeasement with Ottomans. 

In 1584 Jan Zamoyski managed to intercept several letters of the Zborowski brothers (Krzysztof and Samuel), in which they described their preparations for the assassination of the king. Today it is impossible to know whether those letters were real or convenient forgeries, nonetheless, Batory told Zamoyski that Zborowski should be executed, however as he had no power to issue such an order, Zamoyski would act on the basis of the 1573 banition sentence. In May of 1584 Zborowski entered the area of Lesser Poland (Małopolska), which was then under jurisdiction of Jan Zamoyski. He was arrested in Piekary and executed on May 26, 1584 at the Wawel hill by beheading.
