thumb|Light or saddle horse breedsthumb|Heavy or draft horse breeds This page is a list of gaited horse registries for horses with various phenotypes or other traits, which admit any animal fitting a given set of physical characteristics, even if there is minimal or no evidence of the trait being a true-breeding characteristic. 

For additional information, see horse breeding and the individual articles listed below. Additional articles on different breeds may be listed under :Category:Horse breeds and :Category:Types of horses.

==Horse breeds==

<!--Please keep list alphabetized when editing-->
<!--Please don't add red links unless YOU want to create the article-->
<!--Please search list carefully before adding a breed to avoid duplication, also add alternative spellings without wikilinks and point them to existing articles, avoid piped links if possible so that readers are aware of actual article titles when doing future edits-->
<!--Please place pony breeds under "Pony breeds" below-->
Horses are members of ''equus caballus'' that generally mature to be 14.2 hands or taller, but many breed registries do accept animals under this height and classify them as "horses," as horse characteristics include factors other than height.  For the purposes of this page, if a breed registry or stud book classifies the breed as a horse, it is listed here as a horse, even if some representatives are pony-sized or have some pony characteristics.

==Pony breeds==

<!--Please keep list alphabetized when editing-->
<!--Please don't add red links unless YOU want to create the article-->
<!--Please search list carefully before adding a breed to avoid duplication, also add alternative spellings without wikilinks and point them to existing articles, avoid piped links if possible so that readers are aware of actual article titles when doing future edits-->
Ponies are usually classified as animals that mature at less than 14.2 hands.  However, some pony breeds may occasionally have individuals who mature over 14.2 but retain all other breed characteristics.  There are also some breeds that now frequently mature over 14.2 hands due to modern nutrition and management, yet retain the historic classification "pony."  For the purposes of this list, if a breed registry classifies the breed as a "pony," it is listed here as such, even if some individuals have horse characteristics.

(Please note:  Because of this designation by the preference of a given breed registry, most miniature horse breeds are listed as "horses," not ponies)

==Color "breeds"==

There are some registries that accept horses (and sometimes ponies and mules) of almost any breed or type for registration.  Color is either the only criterion for registration or the primary criterion.  These are called "color breeds," because unlike "true" horse breeds, there are few other physical requirements, nor is the stud book limited in any fashion.  As a general rule, the color also does not always breed on (in some cases due to genetic impossibility), and offspring without the stated color are usually not eligible for recording with the color breed registry.  The best-known color breed registries are for the following colors:
* Buckskin (horse)
* Palomino
* Pinto horse
* White (horse)s are registered in the United States with the American creme and white horse registry, which was once called an "Albino" registry until it was understood that true albino does not exist in horses.  (''see White (horse) for details'')

There are breeds that have color that usually breeds "true" as well as distinctive physical characteristics and a limited stud book.  These horses are true breeds that have a preferred color, not color breeds, and include the Friesian horse, the Cleveland Bay, the Appaloosa, and the American Paint Horse.

==Types of horses==
A "type" of horse is not a breed but is simply a term used to describe a group of breeds that are similar in appearance (phenotype) or use.  A type usually has no breed registry, and often encompasses several breeds.  Horses of a given type may be registered as one of several different recognized breeds, or a term may include horses that are of no particular pedigree but meet a certain standard of appearance or use.
