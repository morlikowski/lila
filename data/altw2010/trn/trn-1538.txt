'''アメリカ海兵隊武装偵察部隊 （United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance 通称フォース・リーコン - Force Recon）'''とは、アメリカ海兵隊所属の特殊部隊である。ただし表向きは特殊部隊に分類されるが、主任務はその部隊名の通り威力偵察であり、米特殊作戦陸軍所属のグリーンベレーや米特殊作戦海軍所属のNavy SEALsの様にアメリカ特殊作戦軍（SOCOM）の管轄下には入っておらず、アメリカ海兵隊が直接式管轄を行なっている。以下通称である'''フォース・リーコン'''と呼称する。

==概要==
フォース・リーコンは主に敵地の威力偵察（どちらかと言えば斥候部隊に近い）を主任務とする部隊であり、本体上陸の前に偵察を行い、時には敵地攻撃も行なう。因みにあくまでも行なうのは戦闘斥候であり、本格的に急襲を行うのは一般海兵隊員及びフォース・リーコンと同じく海兵隊の特殊部隊である海兵特殊作戦部隊（Marine Special operations Command : MARSOC、こちらはSOCOM所属）が行なう。 

フォース・リーコンとなる前はガダルカナル島上陸作戦では主力部隊として、朝鮮戦争にも投入されている。その後フォース・リーコンとなったのは1955年5月12日にカリフォルニア州で創設されたのが始まりであり、以降ベトナム戦争での偵察活動や、最近ではイラク戦争にも投入されている。

The direct action, and the control of supporting arms; to convey battlefield.  They are capable of operating independently in combined methods of amphibious and ground operations by utilizing methods of conventional and unconventional warfare in defense of the United States.

The FORECON detachments are one of the two Marine Reconnaissance units assigned to the Ground Combat Element within a Marine Air-Ground Task Force. FORECON support the Command Element. 

Force Recon missions differ slightly from other United States Special Operations Command. Colloquially, Force Recon specializes in tactics similar to the United States Army Green Berets and share approximately 70% of United States Navy SEALS training.

==Mission==

MEF Commander is faced with uncertainty in the battlefield. Reconnaissance provides timely intelligence to Command for battlespace shaping, allowing the MAGTF to act, and react, to changes in the battlefield.<ref>FM 7-92, The Infantry Reconnaissance Platoon and Squad (Airborne, Air Assault, Light Infantry)</ref> As other Special Operations Forces are tasked by and report to USSOCOM, Marine Reconnaissance Units are reserved for supporting the Marine Infantry that are directly involved in battlespace shaping.<ref>MCRP 2-1C, Marine Air-Ground Task Force Intelligence Dissemination</ref>

However, Force Reconnaissance troops are employed far beyond the battlefield, the 'Area of Interest', while the Division's Recon Marines are tasked within the boundaries of the Commander's 'Area of Influence'.  Both 'elite' Marine Reconnaissance units thus differ by the depth of penetration.

Many of the types of reconnaissance missions that are conducted by Marine Recon units are characterized by deep penetrations. This greatly increases the mission time, risk, and support coordination needs.  direct action, both in terms of special entry.<ref>MCO 3500.20B, ''05 Oct 2004''</ref> During the outset of the Vietnam War, they were known as "Key Hole" and "Sting Ray" operations.  The versatility of FORECON is demonstrated when missions quickly turn, planned or not, from a deep reconnaissance operation to a direct action operation.

==="Green Side"===

Tasks characterized as 'deep reconnaissance' by FORECON are known as ''"green side"'' operations. These operations are missions pertaining to deep preassault/postassault reconnaissance. Force Recon Marines collect any intelligence of military importance, observe, identify and report adversaries to forward observing.

==="Black Side"===

''Black Side'' missions are known as direct action, or DA missions. Black Side operations are the flip side to Green Side missions -- Marines get up "close and personal" and go looking for trouble. Examples are seizures of gas/oil platform (or GOPLAT) and the visit, board, search and seizure (or VBSS) of ships (maritime interdiction operations (MIO). Orchestrating Personal Security Detail (PSD) for critically important personnel.  In-Extremis Hostage Rescue was one of the tasks of FORECON; however, this role is now reserved for the special operations forces.

==History==
===The Founding Years===

The origins of Force Recon can be considered to remodeled after many of Marine Corps' own variant of 'special operations forces' historically known as the Marine Raiders, Paramarines and the Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion during the outset of World War II.  

The United States Marine Corps, who been known as the benefactor in theorizing and practicing the United States methods of amphibious tactics, had introduced a new concept in amphibious warfare.  They both sought a 'specialized' team capable of:
* acting as an advance guard, spearheading a larger landing force; to
* seize and hold strategic installations or terrain features until mobilization of larger forces; and 
* operate independently for extended periods of time in hostile territory without the use of a landing force (similar to guerrilla warfare.)
* to confuse and surprise the enemy in raiding parties
* possess exceptional swimmers in rapid infantry involvement including waterborne sabotage

In 1933, the Marine Raiders became the result.  Around this time, practice of combatant diving became the cornerstone of amphibious reconnaissance.  Not until during World War II and Korean War, they developed methods of locking in and out of submarine torpedo bays and use bouyance floats to ascend the surface or use of SCUBA equipment that remains in effect today.

But soon after, the Marine Corps was still in need of a quick reaction force that can be inserted efficiently and without detection of the enemy.  Since the Marine Corps has its own aviation, use of paratroopers became an important role later years.  In the summer of 1940, a paratrooper unit had been envisioned by HQMC, the Paramarines.  It did not come unnoticed as the United States Navy adopted the same philosophy and formed it into the training plan of their famed Underwater Demolition Teams.

The Marine Raiders and Paramarines did not survive after World War II as BGen. Vandegrift, disclosed that having an unit with the Corps as an "'Elite' of the elite" was not acceptable to the Marine Corps' demeanor.  In return, led to its disbandment in 1944, before World War II ended.

===Birth of Force Reconnaissance===

On Amphib. Recon Bn. with Captain Joseph Z. Taylor on board as its new commander.  The Marine Corps foresaw the concern that the battlefield will be facing a new threat to U.S. soil as other countries began to research nuclear weapons capabilities.  Since most of the standard operation procedures on the Marines' battleplan was to engage in amphibious warfare such as assaulting a beachhead, they began to realize they will need to be flexible in engaging hundreds of miles inland from their natural 'amphibious habitat', beyond the front lines of their adversaries.

MCTU #1 packed their gear and headed to Fort Benning, GA for the United States Army Airborne School.  However, some Marines were pulled back to remain and additional few weeks for the U.S. Army's Jumpmaster Course.  Thereafter,  to a small Marine Corps installation at El Centro, CA.  A Chief Warrant Officer in the United States Navy by the name of Lew Vinson, an expert in parachuting was called in to teach this newly formed team MCTU #1 in 'free-falling' tactics.  He has been reputable by the U.S. Navy of heading the testing of parachuting at high altitude became on-going concern encountered by fighter pilots.  During this era, many pilots were being trained in such areas as aircraft were reaching higher and faster achievements in aviation.  Such hazardous heights demanded adequate training in safety of our Marines and sailors.

By evaluating its past history of the Corps's airborne and waterborne practices, they utilized a new plan in dealing with the uncertainty of war.  Their 'special entry' methods of HALO/HAHO was introduced.  They jumped out of any aircraft the United States Navy had to offer, mostly aircrafts that were carrier-bounded.  Most commonly out the small, compact bombing bays of the the High-Altitude, Low Opening/High Opening operations, or known as "HALO/HAHO" jumping.

But engaging in airborne operations weren't the only other involvement concerning them.  In history, United States Marines were used in 'aggressive' maneuvering in support of naval campaigns, and patience isn't one of the these traits that they were known to carry at a very respectful degree.  And stealth was a necessity if they were to catch their adversaries by surprise or in collection of military intelligence.  A handful of Marines were trained by members of United States Army 5th Special Forces Group, instructed through Recondo School.

By 1st Amphibious Reconnaissance Company, with three platoons to train and undergo missions pertaining to their new doctrine.

In 1958, half the Marines in 1st Amphib. Recon. were removed from the Company and hauled over to the Eastern seaboard, forming the 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company, to support the Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic, or FMFLANT.  Then 1st Amphibious Reconnaissance supplemented its new namesake with "Force" from "Amphibious" as the Marine Corps have already been eponymously known as 'amphibious'.  Thus, 1st Force Recon and 2nd Recon Company was conceived.

===Vietnam Era===
===="Key Hole" and "Sting Ray"====
When the forward observing without interruptions, a single shot heard will fail the mission. Evasive techniques were employed to break contact from the enemy for defensive measures as they were lightly armed. However, "Sting Ray" operations placed an opposite role; this method has been familiar since the "Green" Ops and "Black" Ops. During the course, forty-four Marines of 1st Force were killed or missing-in-action.  1st Force Reconnaissance continued in the engagement until 1974 after the U.S. withdrawal.

====Deactivation(s) and Reactivation(s) of the Force Reconnaissance Companies====

1st Force Reconnaissance deactivated in 1974.

All existing Recon Marines were either assigned to reinforce 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company or to the Deep Recon Platoon with 1st and 3rd Recon Battalions.

3rd Force Reconnaissance Company was assigned to Marine Forces Reserve.

1st Force Reconnaissance Company was reactivated in 1986 and was later deployed in the Gulf War.

The result of the Marine Special Operations Command as the headstone of the recent establishment of two Marine Special Operations Battalions has officially deactivated the 3rd and 4th Force Reconnaissance Companies on 24th of February 2006.

==Organization==
Force Reconnaissance Companies are deployed within a type of larger Marine Corps units called a LHA, LHD). There may be as many as three of these groups, with their attendant MEU(SOC)s, deployed around the world at any given time. The mobility and continual rotation of these formations is integral to current Marine Corps operating procedure, which sets a stated goal of being able to field a MEU(SOC) on any shore around the world within six hours of an order being given.

There are currently seven MEU(SOC)s in the Corps. In Okinawa, Japan: the 31st MEU.

As of 2004, there are currently four active Marine Force Reconnaissance companies: 1st Force Reconnaissance, based at Camp Pendleton, California; 2nd Force Reconnaissance, based at Camp Lejeune, Mobile, Honolulu, Hawaii. 5th Force Reconnaissance was folded into 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion as Bravo Company, which also deploys as the Deep Reconnaissance Company in the 31st MEU(SOC) at Okinawa.

The structure of a Force Reconnaissance Company is more similar to that of an infantry company. The command element includes the Commanding Officer or CO (normally a NCO (scout/sniper unit retained from the MEU's Battalion Landing Team. Force Recon units also include U.S. Navy Corpsmen as integrated combat medical personnel, and, like corpsmen in all Marine Corps units, these corpsmen receive the exact same training as the members of the units they support.

==Training==
===Selection===

Entrance in to FORECON is an extensive and demanding process in which Marines will attend the selection process known as the Reconnaissance Indoctrination and Screening.  Marines from any other Reconnaissance unit still must undergo screening as there are no other exceptions into Force Reconnaissance.  As there are Marine Officers in the command element of the Force Recon Companies, it is unlikely for an officer to be inserted with a Force Recon team as they are reserved as the supporting commander; officers within the Maritime Special Purpose Force accepts deployment of commissioned officers in limited scale raids during DA missions.  

In order for Marines to be accepted for the 'Indoc', they must require:

*current physical
*GT score of 105
*CWS-1 swim qualification
*20/20 vision; with minimum correction allowed.  Laser-eye surgery is acceptable as long 20/20 is corrected.
*Normal color vision (with exceptions of able to identify color contrast between red and green)
*Good Pro/Cons.
*Security Clearance required

The 48-hour Reconnaissance Indoctrination and Screening is held once each month at either Camp Lejuene, NC as each unit hold their selection differently in their selection process.  Basically the morning starts off with a standard physical fitness test, a 3-mile run, stomach crunches and chin-ups.  Marine candidates must obtain a First Class score of 285 or higher to continue the indoc.  

Since Marines are amphibious by nature, they will proceed to the pool next where they will perform water aerobics and underwater push ups while wearing boots and cammies.  To simulate a magazine-fed weapon, they swim to the bottom of pool with a depth of 25 feet to retrieve a brick, a 10-pound center-block.  They must carry it to the surface and swim it to the a designated spot.  Also, the candidates tread water with rubber rifles (or known as a "rubber duck") above their head for 30 minutes.

The candidates then run the Obstacle Course, or "O" Course a few times on the next day.  Here the Marines are determined by their effort of how they attempt the course and not by who finishes first.  After the "O" Course, marines then attend the Ruck Sack Run with a ruck sack containing a 50-lbs sand bag and a "rubber duck" for a timed 8-mile run.  The Candidates must keep up a pace of 4-5 mph or else they are dropped and sent back to their original unit.  Any Marine participating as a candidate may at any time dropout and retake the indoc test later; it is common that many Marines will attempt the screening a few times before succeeding.

After the screening, the remaining candidates are then placed for a psychological screening and an interview.  For Officers, they are interviewed by the Company Commander, while Enlisted Marines, the Company Sergeant Major and other Senior NCOs.

===Mission Training Plan===

Each Marine will undergo a non-stop, continuous loop of a two-year cycle in five phases:

*Phase 1 - Individual Training Phase
*Phase 2 - Unit Training Phase 
*Phase 3 - MEU(SOC) Training Phase 
*Phase 4 - MEU(SOC) Deployment 
*Phase 5 - Post Deployment 

====Individual Training Phase====

Once the Marines are accepted for further training, they are inducted into the first step of the accession "pipeline" whereas Marines will undergo extensive training in 'specialized" schools that is known to last for two years until becoming full-fledged Force Reconnaissance Operators.  

This first step, Marines are placed in Reconnaissance Indoctrination Platoons, or RIP.  This is the next step for honing and progressing their skills necessary to function within a Force Reconnaissance Company.  Also acts as another selection and screening board to 'weed out' the lesser motivated Marines (aside from the Reconnaissance Indoctrination and Screening).

The candidates are given further training in patrolling, amphibious reconnaissance, communications and land orientation which will warm-up the Marines before attending the rigorous and demanding Basic Reconnaissance Course.  While in the RIP, candidates are issued a 12 foot rope; at any time instructors will demand the candidates to tie knots (they've learned during RIP) of his choosing.  To the common practice, the candidates are often known as "ropers".

The Force Recon Marines that are qualified and already have obtained the MOS 0321/8654 will take advantage of this phase to attend other specialized schools while the candidates must continue their training before moving onto Phase 2 of the MTP.  They attend the Ranger, Pathfinders, Mountain Leaders Course, Helicopter Rope Suspension Training (HRST) Master, Scout/Sniper Course, and the High Risk Personnel (HRP) Course.

During this phase, the candidates attend the Basic Reconnaissance Course (BRC) at the School of Infantry, East and West coast.<ref>MARADMIN 417/07, Reconnaissance Marine Lateral Move Policy and Procedures</ref>  This course used to be taught at the Amphibious Reconnaissance School, which is located either at NAB Coronado, CA or Little Creek, VA of the Expeditionary Warfare Training Group, Pacific or Atlantic.  Since 2007, due to the availability of housing the facilities, and coordinated support of personnel, the course has been moved to its new locations.

The course is 49-days long with the average training day of 13.5 hours.  This course is what introduces them to the Force Reconnaissance environment.  Marines will gain a working knowledge of the reconnaissance doctrine, concepts and techniques that emphasize on ground and amphibious reconnaissance missions.  To fill a spot in the school, the Marine must have been on one year deployment and a minimum of two years left on their contract, or make a commitment in reenlisting.  The candidates will receive basic knowledge of coxswain skills in planning, organizing, and execution in operating the Combat Rubber Reconnaissance Craft and necessary skills in operating the on board motor, launch and recovery procedures, over-the horizon (OTH), amphibious raids, and operations in the surf zone  Also, maritime navigation is included in the training program, as well as the launch and recovery procedures of the CRRC.<ref>MCO 1543.12 W/Ch.1, Material Fielding Plan for the Combat Rubber Reconnaissance Craft, ''09 Jun 1993''</ref>

Other training includes beach reconnaissance, underwater and breach demolitions, communications, rough terrain skills, and scout swimming. Also, they will learn the fundamentals of weapons of all types (air, sea, and land) that are employed in supporting arms in interfacing with calling and adjusting naval gunfire, artillery, close air support (CAS).  They will practice day and night in learning to operate behind enemy lines and conduct immediate action drills when encountered.  Photography with a field camera and underwater camera for surveillance are also taught along with field sketching where they include to learn range estimations.  Above all, they learn insertion/extraction techniques in Helicopter Rope Suspension Training, such as fast roping, rappelling, and SPIE rigging.<ref>MCO 3500.42A, ''09 Jul 2004''</ref>

Even though every Marine in the past have read a map and patrolling, training is more in depth to ensure that the candidates will receive the skills to efficiently work in a recon team.  Upon graduation, Marines and Corpsmen will then receive the MOS 0321 or NEC 8427; The Marines who are already qualified as parachutist and/or USMC combatant divers and completed the BRC will be assigned as MOS "B" 8654.

In order for Marines remain undetected, they utilize the fundamentals of underwater infiltration in order to execute their objectives.  The USMC Combatant Diver Course is created for that reason.<ref>MCO 1510.125, Individual Training Standard for Marine Combat Water Survival, ''30 Dec 02''</ref>  The course is taught at the LAR-V rebreather), diving physics and medicine, to give first aid to personal or other casualties in cause of diving-related hazards.  Most of the training in combatant diving is mostly done at night

This course is to provide the Marines with the best possible combat underwater tactical swimming training available and developing the skills required to successfully conduct an underwater infiltration and exfiltration required by the Marine Corps Orders pertaining the reconnaissance doctrine.  The candidates will learn through classroom instructions on physical training, drown-proofing and pool familiarization.  Given the confidence and capabilities as a combatant diver enables the Marines to negotiate long distance in open water infiltrating in surface and sub-surface, and learn to deal with the hazards of a "surf zone" tangle, simulating equipment malfunction; to learn how to regain control without panicking.

The purpose for learning open-circuit instills the discipline that involves in descending and ascending procedures, searching for lost, submerged equipment, and day/night surface compass swims as closed-circuit emphasizes on the sub-surface navigation infiltration and exfiltrations.  The combatant divers course combines lecture, demonstration, and practical application in gas mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen and oxygen charging procedures by using the USMC Oxygen Transfer Pump System, or USMC OTPS.  Upon completion of the course, the candidates are honored with the Special "B" MOS 8643.

Next in the pipeline is Jump School, the bread of butter of FORECON.  After they graduated from the BRC and USMC Combatant Diver Course, they are introduced to the skill of parachuting at the United States Army Airborne School stationed abroad Fort Benning, Georgia.  This course is outlined to teach candidates in insertion with a parachute.  This course is separated into three training weeks, Ground, Tower and Jump Week.

Ground Week - Marines are introduced to the MC-5 Ram parachute.  This Ram Air parachute is combined for low-level static line (LLSF) and military free-fall (MFF).  He will learn to properly execute a Parachute Landing Fall (PLF) by absorbing the shock of landing and learn to distribute across the balls of the feet, calf, thigh, buttocks, and back muscle and the proper procedures of exiting an aircraft via static line, landing safely land in an Drop Zone (DZ).

Tower Week - Two towers are used for training, the Swing-Landing Tower, or SLT and the "Tower".  The SLT is a 12-foot high platform to simulate the downward inertia and oscillation of an actual jump.  Instructors have full control of the SLT and can make it challenging as they can determine how hard or soft the Marine will land.  The 250-feet high "Tower" is designed for PLFs, practicing landing during the descent.

Jump Week - In order for a Marine to earn his "silver wings", he is to perform five parachute jumps; an individual jump, and another with tactical assembly, mass exiting jump with equipment - day and night, and an individual mass exiting jump.  In order to earn the USN/USMC parachutist badge, or "gold wings", he must perform and additional five jumps; to include a day/night slick jump which is without equipment, and the fifth jump is a water jump.  A Marine that is Parachutist Qualified is assigned the MOS 8652.
