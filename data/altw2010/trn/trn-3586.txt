==The Company==
GESAP S.p.a. is the airport management company of “''Falcone e Borsellino''” Airport in Palermo. It has a fully paid-up share capital of € 15,912,332.00 divided between the Regional Province of Palermo, the Comune of Palermo, the Chamber of Commerce, the Comune of Cinisi and other minor partners. 
 
Established in 1985, until 1994 Gesap operated exclusively as handler and supplier of ground services for Palermo airport, the management of which is directly assigned by the government and overseen by the District Airport Directorate.
 
In 1994, Gesap was charged with the partial management of the airport through a Convention which granted the company a 20-year mandate to run land side activities (the airport buildings and surrounding areas). 
 
In April 1999, GESAP obtained an anticipated mandate to manage the airport's air side activities, and, more specifically, the flight infrastructures (runways, links, taxiways and aprons) as foreseen by art. 17 L. 135/97.
 
As airport management company, Gesap plans, creates and manages the airport's areas, infrastructures and systems, ensuring the necessary maintenance and implementation of the same. It also provides centralised services such as airport coordination, public information systems, security controls and surveillance as well as managing commercial outlets through concessions to third parties.
 
In April 2004, GESAP was awarded UNI ISO 9001/2000 (Vision 2000) certification. The company had already received certification for its services and processes in the handling sector and this too was renewed by the certification body, TUV, in december 2006.
 
On 30th May 2004, ENAC awarded GESAP an “Airport Certificate” in recognition of the airport's full conformity with the regulations set down in ENAC's “Regulations for the construction and management of airports”. On May 24, 2007 Gesap has obtained the renovation of "Airport Certificate" until May 30, 2010.
 
Today, after having recently transferred its handling sector to a controlled company, GH Palermo, GESAP is awaiting a ministerial decree that will grant it a forty-year concession for the total management of the airport. This comes after the deliberation of ENAC's Board of Directors on March 1, 2005 that was officialised in a Convention signed on November 17, 2006.
