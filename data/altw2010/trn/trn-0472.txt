Etnis '''Afrika-Amerika''', atau '''Afro-Amerika''', adalah sebuah kelompok etnis di Barat. Mayoritas dari rakyat etnis Afrika-Amerika berdarah Amerika Asli.

Istilah yang digunakan untuk merujuk kepada kelompok etnis ini dalam sejarah termasuk ''negro'', ''kulit hitam'', dan istilah lainnya dalam bahasa Inggris: ''colored'', ''Afro-Americans''. Kata ''negro'' dan ''colored'' kini lebih jarang digunakan dan sering dianggap menghina. ''Afrika-Amerika'', ''kulit hitam'' kini lebih sering digunakan, meski istilah ''Afrika-Amerika'' sering disalah gunakan untuk merujuk kepada warga kulit hitam yang bukan penduduk Amerika Serikat juga.

Menurut sensus AS tahun 2003, ada sejumlah 37,1 juta warga kulit hitam di AS, yang berarti 12,9 persen dari total populasi. New York City mempunyai rakyat kulit hitam perkotaan tertinggi pada tahun 2000 dengan jumlah 2 juta jiwa.

== Sejarah singkat ==

Bangsa kulit hitam pertama kali dijual dan diperdagangkan ke selatan Amerika sejak Presiden AS pada 1860, perbudakan pun dihapuskan pada 1863 melalui status hukum. 

Meski demikian, perbedaan ras masih terasa hingga akhirnya sekitar awal dan pertengahan abad ke-20, rakyat kulit hitam mulai bangkit melawan diskriminasi terhadap suku mereka. Puncaknya terjadi pada tahun 1960-an dengan munculnya Gerakan Hak Asasi Manusia di bawah pimpinan Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. dan Roy Wilkins sehingga kini rakyat kulit hitam di AS telah mendapatkan kehidupan dan perlakuan yang jauh lebih baik. Keadaan ekonomi dan tingkatan mereka dalam masyarakat juga telah menjadi lebih baik. Walaupun begitu, secara kolektif, mereka masih saja kalah dibandingkan dengan rakyat kulit putih dalam bidang-bidang tersebut. Banyak masalah sosial seperti akses kesehatan yang kurang dan kesulitan mendapatkan pekerjaan juga masih melekat pada warga kulit hitam di AS.

The popular conception of a race-based slave system did not fully develop until the 1700s. During the 1770s Africans, both enslaved and free, helped rebellious English colonists secure American Independence by defeating the British in the President reconstruction era was initially a time of progress for African Americans, in the late 1890s, Southern states enacted disenfranchisement.<ref></ref> Most African Americans followed the Jim Crow laws and assumed a posture of racially motivated violence. To maintain self-esteem and dignity, schools, churches, banks, social clubs, and other businesses.<ref></ref>

In the last decade of the nineteenth century, racially discriminatory laws and racial violence aimed at African Americans began to mushroom in the United States. These discriminatory acts included Great Migration of the early 20th century,<ref></ref> combined with a growing African-American intellectual and cultural elite in the Northern United States, led to a movement to fight violence and discrimination against African Americans that, like abolitionism before it, crossed racial lines. The Civil Rights Movement aimed at abolishing public and private acts of racial discrimination against African Americans between 1954 to 1968, particularly in the southern United States. By 1966, the emergence of the Black Power movement, which lasted from 1966 to 1975, expanded upon the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity, economic and political self-sufficiency, and freedom from white authority. The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the conditions which brought it into being are credited with putting pressure on President John F. Kennedy and then Lyndon B. Johnson that culminated in the passage the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions.<ref name="abbeville"></ref>

==Demographics==
thumb|275px|right|African Americans as percent of population, 2000.

In 1790, when the first U.S. Census was taken, Africans (including slaves and free people) numbered about 760,000—about 19.3% of the population. In 1860, at the start of the freemen". By 1900, the black population had doubled and reached 8.8 million.

In 1910, about 90% of African Americans lived in the Great Migration, as it was called, spanned the 1890s to the 1970s. From 1916 through the 1960s, more than 6 million black people moved north. But in the 1970s and 1980s, that trend reversed, with more African Americans moving south to the Sunbelt than leaving it.

The following gives the African-American population in the United States over time, based on U.S. Census figures. (Numbers from years 1920 to 2000 are based on U.S. Census figures as given by the ''Time Almanac'' of 2005, p 377) The CIA World Factbook gives a 2006 figure of 12.9%<ref></ref> Controversy has surrounded the "accurate" population count of African Americans for decades. The NAACP believed it was under counted intentionally to minimize the significance of the black population in order to reduce their political power base.

By 1990, the African-American population reached about 30 million and represented 12% of the U.S. population, roughly the same proportion as in 1900.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/aap/timelin2.html Time Line of African American History, 1881-1900]</ref> In current demographics, according to 2005 U.S. South. In that year, 17.6 percent of African Americans lived in the Northeast and 18.7 percent in the Brazilian, Dominican, Cuban, Latin American descent.

The only self-reported ancestral groups larger than African Americans are Irish and German Americans.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf c2kbr01-2.qxd<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> Due to the fact that many African Americans trace their ancestry to colonial American origins, some simply self-report as "American".

Almost 58 percent of African Americans lived in urban population in the Gary, Detroit, Michigan, which was 82 percent African American. Other large cities with African-American majorities include New Orleans, Louisiana (67 percent), Baltimore, Maryland (64 percent) Atlanta, Georgia (61 percent), Memphis, Tennessee (61 percent), and Washington, D.C. (60 percent).

The nation's most affluent county with an African-American majority is Dekalb County in Georgia, and Charles City County in Virginia. Queens County, New York is the only county with a population of 65,000 or more where African Americans have a higher median household income than European Americans.

==Contemporary issues==

African Americans have improved their social economic standing significantly since the Civil Rights Movement and recent decades have witnessed the expansion of a robust, African-American middle class across the United States. Unprecedented access to higher education and employment has been gained by African Americans in the post-civil rights era. Nevertheless, due in part to the legacy of slavery, racism and discrimination, African Americans as a group remain at a pronounced economic, educational and social disadvantage in many areas relative to European Americans. Persistent social, economic and political issues for many African Americans include inadequate health care access and delivery; institutional racism and discrimination in housing, education, policing, criminal justice and employment; crime, poverty and substance abuse. One of the most serious and long standing issues within African-American communities is poverty. Poverty itself is a hardship as it is related to marital stress and dissolution, health problems, low educational attainment, deficits in psychological functioning, and crime.<ref name="CharacOfFam"></ref> In 2004, 24.7% of African-American families lived below the poverty level.<ref name="DeNavas-Walt"/>

===Economic status===
thumb|200px|[[Oprah Winfrey, the richest African American of the 20th century.<ref></ref><ref name="roles"/><ref></ref>]]
Economically, African-Americans have benefited from the advances made during the Civil Rights era, particularly among the educated, but not without the lingering effects of historical marginalization when considered as a whole. The racial disparity in poverty rates has narrowed. The black middle class has grown substantially. In 2000, 47% of African Americans owned their homes. The poverty rate among African Americans has dropped from 26.5% in 1998 to 24.7% in 2004.<ref name="DeNavas-Walt"/>

In 2004, African-American workers had the second-highest median earnings of American minority groups after Asian Americans, and African Americans had the highest level of male-female income parity of all ethnic groups in the United States.<ref></ref> Also, among American minority groups, only Asian Americans were more likely to hold white collar occupations (management, professional, and related fields),<ref></ref> and African Americans were no more or less likely than European Americans to work in the service industry.<ref name="Black Pop-March 2002"></ref> In 2001, over half of African-American households of married couples earned $50,000 or more.<ref name="Black Pop-March 2002"/> Although in the same year African Americans were over-represented among the nation's poor, this was directly related to the disproportionate percentage of African-American families headed by single women; such families are collectively poorer, regardless of ethnicity.<ref name="Black Pop-March 2002"/>

By 2006, gender continued to be the primary factor in income level, with the median earnings of African-American men more than those black and non-black American women overall and in all educational levels.<ref name = "census.gov-PINC03">[http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_131.htm PINC-03-Part 131<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref name = "census.gov-254">[http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_254.htm PINC-03-Part 254<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref name = "census.gov-259">[http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_259.htm PINC-03-Part 259<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref name = "census.gov-135">[http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_135.htm PINC-03-Part 135<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref>[http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_253.htm PINC-03-Part 253<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>  At the same time, among American men, income disparities were significant; the median income of African-American men was approximately 76 cents for every dollar of their European American counterparts, although the gap narrowed somewhat with a rise in educational level.<ref>[http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_128.htm PINC-03-Part 128<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref name = "census.gov-PINC03"/>  Overall, the median earnings of African-American men were 72 cents for every dollar earned of their Asian American counterparts, and $1.17 for every dollar earned by Hispanic men.<ref name = "census.gov-PINC03"/><ref>[http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_133.htm PINC-03-Part 133<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref name = "census.gov-135"/> On the other hand by 2006, among American women with post-secondary education, African-American women have made significant advances; the median income of African-American women was more than those of their Asian-, European and Hispanic American counterparts with at least some college education.<ref name = "census.gov-254"/><ref>[http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_005.htm PINC-03-Part 5<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref name = "census.gov-259"/>

However, African Americans are still underrepresented in government and employment. In 1999, the median income of African-American families was $33,255 compared to $53,356 of European Americans. In times of economic hardship for the nation, African Americans suffer disproportionately from job loss and underemployment, with the black underclass being hardest hit. The phrase "last hired and first fired" is reflected in the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment figures. Nationwide, the September 2004 unemployment rate for blacks was 10.3%, while their white counterparts were unemployed at the rate of 4.7%.

The income gap between black and white families is also significant. In 2005, employed blacks earned only 65% of the wages of whites in comparable jobs, down from 82% in 1975.<ref name="DeNavas-Walt"></ref>  Although rates of births to unwed mothers among both blacks and whites have risen since the 1950s, the rate of such births among African Americans is three times the rate of whites.

According to ''American, European descent, briefly hit $100 billion in 1999. In Forbes' 2007 list, Gates' net worth decreased to $59 billion while Winfrey's increased to $2.5 billion,<ref name = "AP-forbes400">[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070920/apfn_forbes_400_alphabetical_list.html]</ref> making her the world's richest black person.<ref></ref><ref name="roles"></ref> Winfrey is also the first African American to make Business Week's annual list of America's 50 greatest philanthropists.<ref></ref> BET founder Bob Johnson was also listed as a billionaire prior to an expensive divorce and has recently regained his fortune through a series of real estate investments. Although Forbes estimates his net worth at $1.1 billion, which makes him the only male African-American billionaire, Winfrey remains the only African American wealthy enough to rank among the country's 400 richest people.<ref name = "AP-forbes400"/>

===Health===
By 2003, sex had replaced race as the primary factor in life expectancy in the United States, with African-American females expected to live longer than European American males born in that year.<ref name="CDC2003Deaths"></ref>  In the same year, the gap in life expectancy between American whites (78.0) and blacks (72.8) had decreased to 5.2 years, reflecting a long term trend of this phenomenon.<ref name="CDC2003Deaths"/>  By 2004, "the trend toward convergence in mortality figures across the major race groups also continued," with white-black gap in life expectancy dropping to 5 years.<ref></ref>  The current life expectancy of African Americans as a group is comparable to those of other groups who live in countries with a high human development index.

At the same time, the life expectancy gap is affected by collectively lower access to quality medical care. With no system of universal health care, access to medical care in the U.S. generally is mediated by income level and employment status. As a result, African Americans, who have a disproportionate occurrence of poverty and unemployment as a group, are more often uninsured than non Hispanic whites or Asians.<ref></ref> For a great many African Americans, healthcare delivery is limited, or nonexistent. And when they receive healthcare, they are more likely than others in the general population to receive substandard, even injurious medical care.<ref></ref> African Americans have a higher prevalence of some chronic health conditions.<ref></ref>

African Americans are the American ethnic group most affected by sex with members of their own racial group.

===News media and coverage===
News media coverage of African American news, concerns or dilemmas is inadequate, some activists and academics contend.<ref>blackandbrownnews.com Sharon Toomer, editor http://www.blackandbrownnews.com</ref><ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4608039 Examining the Future of Black News Media : NPR<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4608042 How Will African Americans Get the News? : NPR<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>
Activists also contend that the news media present distorted images of African-Americans.<ref>Mikal Muharrar, "Media Blackface," "FAIR," Sept./ October 1998, http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1431</ref>

===Politics and social issues===
Collectively, African Americans are more involved in the American political process than other minority groups in the US, indicated by the highest level of voter registration and participation in elections among these groups in 2004.<ref name="vote-nov2007"></ref> African Americans collectively attain higher levels of education than immigrants to the United States.<ref name="vote-nov2007"/>

===Cultural influence in the United States===

thumb|300px|The King & Carter Jazzing Orchestra photographed in Houston, Texas, January 1921
From their earliest presence in North America, African Americans have contributed literature, art, agricultural skills, foods, clothing styles, music, language, social and technological innovation to American culture.
The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the U.S., such as yams, peanuts, rice, okra, sorghum, grits, watermelon, indigo dyes, and cotton, can be traced to African and African-American influences. A couple of notable examples include George Washington Carver, who created 300 products from peanuts, 118 products from sweet potatoes, and 75 from pecans; and George Crum, who invented the potato chip in 1853.<ref></ref>
Hip hop, R&B, rock and roll, country and techno. African-American genres are the most important ethnic vernacular tradition in America, as they have developed independent of African traditions from which they arise more so than any other immigrant groups, including Europeans; make up the broadest and longest lasting range of styles in America; and have, historically, been more influential, interculturally, geographically, and economically, than other American vernacular traditions.<ref name="stewart"></ref>

African Americans have also had an important role in American dance. Stepping, is an African-American tradition whose performance and competition has been formalized through the traditionally black fraternities and sororities at universities.

Many African-American authors have written stories, poems, and essays influenced by their experiences as African Americans.  James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison, and Maya Angelou.

Following the Civil War, the growth of industry in the United States was tremendous, and much of this was made possible with inventions by ethnic minorities. By 1913 over 1,000 inventions were patented by black Americans. Among the most notable inventors were Jan Matzeliger, who developed the first machine to mass-produce shoes, and Elijah McCoy, who invented automatic lubrication devices for steam engines.  Granville Woods had 35 patents to improve electric railway systems, including the first system to allow moving trains to communicate. He even sued Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison for stealing his patents and won both cases.  Garrett Morgan developed the first automatic traffic signal and gas mask.<ref name="black-people-history"></ref>

Lewis Latimer created an inexpensive cotton-thread filament, which made electric light bulbs practical because Edison's original light bulb only burned for a few minutes. More recent inventors include McKinley Jones, who invented the movable refrigeration unit for food transport in trucks and trains. Lloyd Quarterman worked with six other black scientists on the creation of the atomic bomb (code named the Manhattan Project.)  Quarterman also helped develop the first nuclear reactor, which was used in the atomically powered submarine called the Nautilus.<ref name="black-people-history"/>

A few other notable examples include the first successful  Frederick Gregory, who was not only the first black astronaut pilot but the person who redesigned the cockpits for the last three space shuttles. Gregory was also on the team that pioneered the microwave instrumentation landing system. In 2000, Bendix Aircraft Company began a worldwide promotion of this microwave instrumentation landing system.<ref name="black-people-history"/>
