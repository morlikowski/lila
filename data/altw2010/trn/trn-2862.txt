'''Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels''' er en katolsk katedral i Los Angeles i California. Den tilhører Los Angeles erkebispedømme, og er hovedsete for kardinal Roger Michael Mahony, erkebiskop av Los Angeles.

Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels erstattet Cathedral of Saint Vibiana, som ble hardt skadet i et jordskjelv i 1994. Det ble estimert at det ville være billigere å bygge en helt ny katedral enn å bygge opp den gamle, og den spanske arkitekten José Rafael Moneo ledet byggingen av den nye katedralen. 

Byggingen begynte i mai 1999, og katedralen sto ferdig våren 2002. Dette var den første byggingen av en katedral i det vestlige USA på 30 år.

The '''Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels''', also called the '''Los Angeles Cathedral''', is a Los Angeles, Archdiocese of Los Angeles<ref name ="olahistory"></ref> and seat of its archbishop, currently Roger Cardinal Mahony<ref name></ref>.

Consecrated and dedicated on September 2, 2002<ref name = "olahistory"/>, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels replaced the smaller Cathedral of Saint Vibiana, irreparably damaged in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake<ref name = "olahistory"/>.  It is mother church to over four million professed Catholics in the archdiocese<ref name ="ola"></ref>.

Our Lady of the Angels is home to the relics of Saint Vibiana, brought from Rome by Thaddeus Amat y Brusi, the first bishop of Los Angeles.

==Design==

The cathedral was designed by Spanish acute and obtuse angles.  There is an absence of Robert Graham.

Like the Oakland Saint Francis de Sales Cathedral, Our Lady of the Angels is designed with protections from future earthquake structural damage.  Every detail of construction was specified to last approximately five hundred years.

The site of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels is 5.6 acres (23,000&nbsp;m²) bound by Temple Street, Grand Avenue, Hill Street and the Hollywood Freeway.<ref name = "olahistory"/>

The 12-story high building can accommodate 3,000+ worshippers. The site includes the cathedral proper, a 2.5 acre (10,000&nbsp;m²) plaza, several gardens and waterfalls, the Cathedral Center (with the gift shop, the Galero Grill, conference center, and cathedral parish offices), and the cathedral rectory, the residence of Roger Mahony. The entire complex is 58,000 square feet (5,000&nbsp;m²). The main sanctuary is 333 feet (100 m) long (purposely one foot longer than &nbsp;St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York). The internal height varies from 80' over the baptistery at the rear (west) end to about 100' near the lantern window (east end).

Among the artworks commissioned for the cathedral are the tapestries of the communion of Lake City, ranks of pipes, some of which were retained from the 1980 Austin organ from St. Vibiana's Cathedral. The case of the organ is approximately  high, and is placed about  above the floor. &nbsp;The top of the organ's case is about  above the cathedral's floor.

==History==

thumb|300px|right|The inside of the cathedral
Estimates for the restoration of the earthquake damaged Cathedral of Saint Vibiana ranged around $180 million. The structure was eventually restored by developers Tom Gilmore and Richard Weintraub, transforming it into an events center and performance venue. 

Because the old cathedral was known to be of rather inferior construction (something noted soon after its completion in 1876) and had been far too small for diocesan celebrations for decades, the archdiocese chose to build a new cathedral (ultimately on a new site). The decision to change venues was influenced in part by certain conservationists, who argued that the outmoded cathedral ought to be restored and preserved as an historic landmark, and the needs of the new cathedral itself — it was to have a capacity of approximately 3,000 worshipers, the same number as cathedral design from the 1940s that was never built, yet provided the Holy See-approved name for the new cathedral. Initially, the proposed budget was $150 million, but as the charities and donations kept coming, the architects and builders were able to implement everything desired. Thus, the final cost of the new cathedral was $189.7 million.

Cardinal Mahony's decision to rebuild the Los Angeles cathedral in such elaborate and post-modern architecture drew criticism from a number of critics both within and outside the Catholic Church, who argued that a church of that size and expense was unnecessary and overly-elaborate. Many felt that either St. Vincent Church on West Adams Boulevard or St. Basil Church on South Kingsley Drive could easily perform the functions required of a cathedral with minimal additional cost. Our Lady of the Angels Cathedral was also criticized for its departure from traditional California Mission-style architecture and aesthetics.

The price for some cathedral furnishings have also caused great consternation. $5M was budgeted for the altar or "table" -- essentially a giant slab of Rosso Laguna marble. The main bronze doors cost $3M. $2M was budgeted for the wooden ambo (lectern.)  $1M for a very controversial-looking tabernacle. $1M for the cathedra (bishop's chair.)  $250K for the presider's chair. $250K for each deacon's chair. Visiting bishops' chairs cost $150K each, while pews cost an average of $50K each. The cantor's stand cost $100K while ''each'' bronze chandelier/speaker cost $150K.<ref name ="Weber"></ref>
