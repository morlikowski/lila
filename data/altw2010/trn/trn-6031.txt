'''ゴールキーパー'''（''Goal Keeper''）とは、ホッケー、アイスホッケー、ラクロス、水球、フットサルなどの競技で見られるポジションである。

ゴールキーパーの役割は、ゴールにボールが入ってこないように守ることであり、これはすべての競技において共通している事項である。

'''キーパー'''と略すこともある。略称としては他にアルファベット2文字で''GK''と表す場合もある。また、'''ゴールテンダー'''（''goaltender''）や'''ゴーリー'''（''goalie''）と言う呼称も存在するが、競技や国によって呼称が異なることに注意されたし。なお呼称について競技上特色があるものに付いては、以下においても述べる。

== 概要 ==
一般的に、ゴールキーパーと言われるポジションの選手は、他の選手と比べて、異なるプレーが求められていたり、ルールによって定められていたりする。（具体的にはボールやパックを手で掴むこと）又このポジションの選手は他のポジションの選手に比べるとボディーコンタクトに対して無防備になることが多い。そのため、このポジションに対して特別なルールが適用される場合がある。どの競技もフィールドに1人のみと定められているのが多い。

== ハンドボール ==
ハンドボールのゴールキーパーは他のポジションの選手とは異なる色のユニフォームを着用する。背番号は1,12,16など。
キーパーの特権として、フィールド上にいる選手の中で、一人だけ、6メートルラインの中に入ることができ、さらにその中では、相手のシュートをセーブするときにのみ、足を使うことを許されている。

== アイスホッケー ==
:詳しくは''ゴールキーパー (アイスホッケー)''を参照のこと。

米語では'''ゴーリー'''（''goalie''）、'''ゴールテンダー'''（''goaltender''）などと呼び、英語流に'''ネットマインダー'''（''netminder''）と呼ぶ国もある。アイスホッケーのゴールキーパーはパックを手で扱うことが認められている。見た目上の特徴としては他のポジションの選手に比べて防具の種類が多く、重装備をしていることに特徴がある。又ゴールキーパーに対する意図的な接触はペナルティーの対象となる。
ユニフォームは他のポジション選手と同じものを着る。

== ホッケー ==
ホッケー（フィールド・ホッケー）のゴールキーパーは他のポジションの選手と違い、唯一ヘルメット、脛当て、手袋などの防具をしている。また、他のポジションの選手とは異なる色のユニフォームを着用する。ゴールキーパーはシューティングサークル内で、ボールを体で止めたり、足で蹴ってボールがゴールに入ることを防ぐ事ができる。

In many team goal. Such positions exist in association football, handball, ice hockey, field hockey, netball, water polo, bandy, lacrosse, floorball and a number of other sports.   

==Overview==
Usually special rules apply to the goalkeeper that do not apply to the other players. These rules are often instituted to protect the goalkeeper, being an obvious target for dangerous or even violent actions.  In certain sports, such as ice hockey, goalkeepers are required to wear special equipment like heavy pads and a face mask to protect their bodies from the impact of the playing object (e.g. a puck). In association football, goalkeepers usually wear gloves to protect their hands and enhance grip of the ball.

==Examples==
===Football (soccer)===

thumb|Youth-football goalkeeper
In football (soccer), each team's goalkeeper defends his team's goal and has special privileges within the game. The goalkeeper's main job is to stop any penetration of the ball into the goal. 

The goalkeeper is the only player who may use his or her hands to play the ball in open play (although only within the penalty area). The goalkeeper is required to wear a different coloured kit to all other players, referee and assistant referee to avoid confusion.  Goalkeepers often wear gloves to aid in catching the ball.

As the goalkeeper is usually the team's only player who can see the entire field, they often act as an organizer of the team when it is defending.

===Field hockey===
In field hockey, the goalkeeper generally wears extensive protective equipment including helmet, face and neck guards, chest and leg padding, gloves, lower leg guards (known as pads) and shoe covers (known as kickers).  Only the helmet is compulsory, as is a shirt of a different color from any of the other players. He or she is also equipped with a stick; either one specified for goalies or one used for normal play. The goalkeeper is allowed to use any part of their body to deflect the ball, although they can't obstruct its play (for example by lying on top of it), and they can only do so within the goal circle (or "D"), and they are not permitted to pass their team's 23m line, with the exception of goalkeepers who take penalty strokes.

===Gaelic football===
In Gaelic football, the goalie's main task is to prevent a goal from being scored against his side by directly defending the team's goal. A goal occurs when the ball passes through the goal; the attacking team is awarded 3 points. The goalie is the only player who may handle the ball on the ground, and only inside the small rectangle.

===Hurling===
In hurling, the goalkeeper's main task is to prevent a goal from being scored against his side by directly defending the team's goal. He also takes "puckouts" after a score or wide ball. A goal occurs when the ball passes through the goal; the attacking team is awarded 3 points. The goalkeeper has no special rules pertaining to him, although he still wears a different color jersey. Most goalkeepers use a special hurley with a wider ''bas'' (flat face).

===Bandy===
In bandy, the goalkeeper defends his team's goal and has special privileges within the game. The goalkeeper's main job is to stop any penetration of the ball into the goal. He is allowed to hold the ball for six seconds before he has to release it. He may drop it to a defender or chuck it directly into attack.

If the ball passes the goal line, it is followed by different actions: 
* If the ball is last touched by a defender, the reaction is an own goal if the ball goes between the goalposts. 
* If it passes outside the goalposts, the reaction is a corner stroke. 
* If last touched by an attacker's stick, and passes between the posts, the reaction is a goal, or 
* a disallowed goal (offside or an infringement from the attacking team). 
* If the ball passes from an attacker over the goal line outside the goalposts, the goalkeeper may retrieve a new ball from a cage hanging on the goal's either side, and put the new ball in play with no signal from the referees.

The goalkeeper is the only player who may use his or her hands to play the ball (although only within the penalty area). The goalkeeper is required to wear a jersey with a color unlike his/her or the other teams jersey color to avoid confusion for the referee.  Goalkeepers wear padded gloves to aid in catching the ball. He also wears large shinpads, and a padded sweater, and a helmet with a face mask.

He is the only player in the team who can pass the ball to a team mate by aide of his skates. The team might have a reserve goalkeeper, and the two may switch at ant time during the game, even without notifying the referee. There is no time-out in bandy, but an exception is sometimes made when the goalkeeper is hust, especially if they don't have a designated reserve keeper.

As the goalkeeper is usually the team's only player who can see the entire field, they often act as an organizer of the team when it is defending, especially for fre strokes against them.

===Ice hockey===

===International rules football===
In International rules football, a hybrid game between Australian rules football (which does not have a goalkeeper) and Gaelic football, the goalkeeper's main task is to prevent a goal from being scored. A goal occurs when the ball comes off any part of an attacking player and passes through the goal; the attacking team is awarded 6 points. 

===Field and Box Lacrosse===

In men's field lacrosse,  once a goalkeeper makes a save and has control of the ball in his crosse (stick), he may only remain in possession of the ball inside the protective crease for four seconds (the length may depend on the level of play). Before the four seconds is up, the goalkeeper must either pass the ball or leave the crease. After leaving, he may not re-enter the crease with possession of the ball.

While inside the crease (nine feet in radius), offensive players may not make contact with the goalie or his stick. Doing so is declared "goalie interference" and is penalized by a free clear to the half field line. (There is a significant difference between NCAA/MLL rules and international rules regarding a pass while the goalkeeper is inside the crease: under NCAA/MLL rules, contact with a goalie's stick while in the act of passing -- even after the ball is released -- is prohibited and considered interference. Under international rules, protection ends when possession ends. Therefore, contact with a goalie's stick after the ball is released, is legal.) In addition, a goalie is allowed to make contact with the ball with his hand, although he is not allowed to control it or pick it up.
