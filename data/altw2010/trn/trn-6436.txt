'''Baron Teynham''', of Teynham in the County of Kent, is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1616 for '''Sir John Roper'''. His great-great-grandson, the fifth Baron, served as Lord Lieutenant of Kent. The latter's third son, the eighth Baron, married, as his second wife, Anne Barrett-Lennard, 16th Baroness Dacre. His eldest son from this marriage, the Hon. Charles Roper, was the father of Trevor Charles Roper, 18th Baron Dacre, and Gertrude Trevor Roper, 19th Baroness Dacre (see the Baron Dacre for more information). His youngest son from this marriage, Reverend Hon. Richard Henry Roper, was the great-great-great-grandfather of the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton.

The eighth Baron was succeeded by his eldest son from his first marriage to the Hon. Catherine Smythe, the ninth Baron. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the tenth Baron. The latter's grandson, the fourteenth Baron, assumed in 1788 by Royal license the surname of Curzon in lieu of his patronymic but in 1813 he resumed by Royal license his original surname of Roper in addition to that of Curzon. His great-great-grandson, the seventeenth Baron, served as Deputy Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords from 1946 to 1959. As of 2007 the title is held by the latter's son, the eighteenth Baron, who succeeded in 1972.
