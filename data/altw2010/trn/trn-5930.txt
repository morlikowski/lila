Cu o suprafaţă de 1200 mp, aproximativ un teren şi jumătate de fotbal, catedrala milaneză, una dintre imaginile emblematice ale Italiei şi ale Europei, este cel de-al treilea edificiu bisericesc romano-catolic ca mărime din lume, după domul San Pietro din Roma şi catedrala din Sevilla. Podoabă cu totul unică a arhitecturii gotice, domul din Milano are o capacitate de peste 40.000 de locuri şi o lungime de 157 m.
 
Este una dintre catedralele occidentale a căror construcţie s-a întins pe durata a câtorva secole. Începută în 1386 şi incheiată în 1887, ea domină astăzi piaţa centrală din Milano, fiind un simbol al puterii economice pe care această capitală a Lombardiei, poartă de intrare a comertului ce traversa Alpii, l-a reprezentat timp de veacuri. Maiestuozitatea şi formele estetice ale catedralei sunt grăitoare: detaliile sculpturale ale celor 135 de turle, dintre care cea mai înaltă atinge 109 metri, şi cele peste 2000 de statui, sunt foarte atent executate, la fel şi marile ferestre ale clădirii, considerate a fi cele mai mari din lume.

Constructia propriu-zisă a inceput in 1386 la iniţiativa arhiepiscopului Antonio de Saluzzo, într-un stil gotic târziu, cu specific mai degrabă francez decât italian. Munca a continuat timp de secole, turnul principal fiind împodobit in 1762 cu o statuie policromă a Fecioarei Maria, căreia i-a fost dedicat de la început Domul milanez. Interiorul nu este mai puţin frapant. Cinci nave gigantice, separate de stâlpi de piatră artistic sculptaţi, sunt incadrate de ferestre cu vitralii executate cu mare măiestrie. Absida, partea cea mai veche a catedralei, include trei ferestre in formă de roză, realizate de Filippino de Modena, într-un mod ce ne dezvăluie complexitatea sculpturii din secolul al XlV-lea.
 
Poetul englez P. B. Shelley, adept al curentului literar romantic, călător in Italia la inceputul secolului al XVIII-lea, afirma că interiorul Domului este cel mai bun loc pentru a citi "Divina Comedia". Dar, doar cu puţin timp înainte, Domul fusese martorul unui eveniment cu totul opus explorării lumii celeste a lui Dante, mai exact catedrala fusese aleasă de Napoleon pentru a fi incoronat rege al Italiei.
 
Actualmente, Domul din Milano este un obiectiv nelipsit in agenda turistica al fiecărui vizitator ce păşeşte în vechiul oraş italian, dar şi un lăcaş de cult creştin in care messa se săvârşeşte duminical.

'''Milan Cathedral''' (Italian: '''Duomo di Milano'''; Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi. 

The cathedral is significant in the promulgation of the Christian faith, for its role in the establishment of Catholic traditions of worship, its outstanding musical heritage and the splendour of its Gothic architecture.

Built from the late 14th well into the 19th century (and in a sense, never completed as work continues), the Duomo di Milano is one of the world's largest churches, being second in size within Italy only to Gothic cathedral in the world, after the Cathedral of Seville in Spain. 

The interior height of its central nave is surpassed only by the choir of the incomplete Beauvais Cathedral in France.
 
==History==
The plan of Milan, with streets either radiating from the Duomo or circling it, reveals the Duomo occupies the most center site in Roman Mediolanum, that of the public forum. Saint Ambrose's 'New Basilica' was built on this site at the beginning of the 5th century, with an adjoining basilica added in 836. When fire damaged both buildings in 1075, they were rebuilt as the Duomo. 

===The beginning===
In 1386 the archbishop, Antonio da Barnabò. Before actual work began, three main buildings were demolished: the palace of the Archbishop, the Ordinari Palace and the Baptistry of 'St. Stephen at the Spring', while the old church of Sta. Maria Maggiore was exploited as a stone quarry. Enthusiasm for the immense new building soon spread among the population, and the shrewd Gian Galeazzo, together with his cousin the archbishop, collected large donations for the work-in-progress. The construction program was strictly regulated under the "Fabbrica del Duomo", which had 300 employees led by first chief engineer Simone da Orsenigo. Galeazzo gave the Fabbrica exclusive use of the marble from the Candoglia quarry and exempted it from taxes.

In 1389 a French chief engineer, Nicolas de Bonaventure, was appointed, adding to the church its strong Gothic imprint. Ten years later another French architect, Jean Mignot, was called from Paris to judge and improve upon the work done, as the masons needed new technical aid to lift stones to an unprecedented height. Mignot declared all the work done up till then as in ''pericolo di ruina'' ("peril of ruin"), as it had been done ''sine scienzia'' ("without science"). In the following years Mignot's forecasts proved untrue, but anyway they spurred Galeazzo's engineers to improve their instruments and techniques. Work proceeded quickly, and at the death of Gian Galeazzo in 1402, almost half the cathedral was complete. Construction, however, stalled almost totally until 1480, due to lack of money and ideas: the most notable works of this period were the tombs of Marco Carelli and Pope Martin V (1424) and the windows of the apse (1470s), of which those extant portray ''St. John the Evangelist'', by Cristoforo de' Mottis, and ''Saint Eligius'' and ''San John of Damascus'', both by Niccolò da Varallo. In 1452, under Francesco Sforza, the nave and the aisles were completed up to the sixth bay.

In 1500-1510, under Lodovico Sforza, the octagonal cupola was completed, and decorated in the interior with four series of fifteen statues each, portraying saints, prophets, sibyls and other characters of the Bible. The exterior long remained without any decoration, except for the ''Guglietto dell'Amadeo'' ("Amadeo's Little Spire"), constructed 1507-1510. This is a Renaissance masterwork which nevertheless harmonized well with the general Gothic appearance of the church.

During the subsequent Spanish domination, the new church proved usable, even though the interior remained largely unfinished, and some bays of the nave and the transepts were still missing. In 1552 Trivulzio candelabrum (12th century) were added.

===Carlo Borromeo===

After the accession of the ambitious Giovanni, Barnabò and Francesco and his wife Bianca, Galeazzo Maria and Lodovico Sforza, which were brought to unknown destinations. However, Borromeo's main intervention was the appointment, in 1571, of Pellegrino Pellegrini as chief engineer&mdash; a contentious move, since to appoint Pellegrino, who was not a lay brother of the duomo, required a revision of the Fabbrica's statutes.

Borromeo and Pellegrino strove for a new, Renaissance appearance for the cathedral, that would emphasise its Roman / Italian nature, and subdue the Gothic style, which was now seen as foreign. As the façade still was largely incomplete, Pellegrini designed a "Roman" style one, with columns, obelisks and a large tympanum. When Pellegrini's design was revealed, a competition for the design of the facade was announced, and this elicited nearly a dozen entries, including by Antonio Barca <ref></ref>.

This design was never carried out, but the interior decoration continued: in 1575-1585 the presbytery was rebuilt, while new altars and the baptistry were added in the nave. 

Wooden choirstalls were constructed by 1614 for the main altar by Francesco Brambilla.

In 1577 Borromeo finally consecrated the whole edifice as a new church, distinct  from the old Santa Maria Maggiore and Santa Tecla (which had been unified in 1549 after heavy disputes).

===17th century===

At the beginning of the 17th century Federico Borromeo had the foundations of the new façade laid by Francesco Maria Richini and Fabio Mangone. Work continued until 1638 with the construction of five portals and two middle windows. In 1649, however, the new chief architect Carlo Buzzi introduced a striking revolution: the façade was to revert to original Gothic style, including the already finished details within big Gothic pilasters and two giant belfries. Other designs were provided by, among others, Filippo Juvarra (1733) and Luigi Vanvitelli (1745), but all remained unapplied. In 1682 the façade of Santa Maria Maggiore was demolished and the cathedral's roof covering completed.

In 1762 one of the main features of the cathedral, the Madonnina's spire, was erected at the dizzying height of 108.5 m. It was designed by Francesco Croce and sports at the top a famous polychrome statue of the Madonna, that befits the original stature of the cathedral.  Given Milan's notoriously damp and foggy climate, the Milanese consider it a fair-weather day when the Madonnina is visible from a distance, as it is so often covered by mist.

===Completion===

On May 20, 1805, Napoleon Bonaparte, about to be crowned King of Italy, ordered the façade to be finished. In his enthusiasm, he assured that all expenses would fall to the French treasurer, who would  reimburse the Fabbrica for the real estate it had to sell. Even though this reimbursement was never paid, it still meant that finally, within only seven years, the Cathedral had its façade completed. The new architect, Francesco Soave, largely followed Buzzi's project, adding some neo-Gothic details to the upper windows. As a form of thanksgiving, a statue of Napoleon was placed at the top of one of the spires.

In the following years, most of the missing arches and spires were constructed. The statues on the southern wall were also finished, while in 1829-1858, new stained glass windows replaced the old ones, though with less aesthetically significant results. The last details of the cathedral were finished only in the 20th century: the last gate was inaugurated on January 6, 1965. This date is considered the very end of a process which had proceeded for generations, although even now, some uncarved blocks remain to be completed as statues. The Duomo's main facade is under renovation as of 2007; canvas-covered scaffolding obscures most of the facade.

==Architecture and art==

The cathedral of Milano is often described as one of the greatest churches in the world. The ground plan is of a nave with 5 aisles, crossed by a transept and then followed by choir and apsis. The height of the nave is about 45 meters, the highest Gothic vaults of a complete church (less than the 48 meters of Beauvais Cathedral that was never completed).
