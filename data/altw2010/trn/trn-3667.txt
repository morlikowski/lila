'''Argentyńskie Siły Powietrzne''' (''Fuerza Aérea Argentina'' - FAA), powstała po II wojnie światowej formacja wojskowa, podlegająca prezydentowi kraju, lecz nadzór operacyjny sprawuje Ministerstwo Obrony, w skład którego wchodzą 4 dowództwa, z najważniejszym dowództwem Operacji Sił Powietrznych. Do pozostałych należy dbanie o logistykę i wsparcie, czym zajmuje się Dowództwo Zaopatrzenia, Dowództwo Szkolenia i Dowództwo Regionów Powietrznych. Głównym trzonem Argentyńskich Sił Powietrznych jest 9 brygad lotniczych, które są podzielone na grupy, których numeracja jest tożsama z numerem brygady macierzystej. Obecnie na ich wyposażeniu znajduje się 46 różnego typu samolotów.

=== Samoloty produkcji zagranicznej ===
Jednym z głównych elementów sił bojowych są 3 grupy lotnicze które są wyposażone we francuskie Dagger. Z kolei samoloty w wersji CJ i 3 III BJ w 1982 roku, a kolejne 10 Samolotów Mirage w wersji 5P z Peru.

Samoloty Mirage IIIBJ/CJ mają jedynie 2 eskadry 4 Grupy Myśliwskiej z El Plumerillo, zaś maszyny pozyskane z Peru znajdują się w eskadrze 10 Grupy Myśliwskiej w Rio Gallegos, ale największa ich koncentracja jest w bazie Tandil, niedaleko stolicy Argentyny Buenos Aires, gdzie stacjonuje 6 Grupa Myśliwska. Posiada ona 2 eskadry Daggerów i 2 eskadry Mirage III EA/DA

=== Samoloty produkcji krajowej ===
Głównym samolotem krajowym jest stary samolot A-58 Pucara. Z uwagi na stary typ konstrukcji liczba samolotów pozostających w czynnej służbie jest mocno ograniczona. Inny krajowy samolot krajowej produkcji, A-63 Pampa, jest wykorzystywany do szkolenia podstawowego i zaawansowanego. Obecnie siły argentyńskie posiadają około 100 samolotów tego typu. 4 grupa myśliwska dysponuje także kilkoma śmigłowcami ratowniczymi Aerospatiale SA-315B Lama.

The '''Argentine Air Force''' ('''Fuerza Aérea Argentina''' or '''FAA''') is the national aviation branch of the armed forces of Argentina.

==History==
The Argentine Air Force's history begins with the establishment of the Escuela de Aviación Militar (''Military Aviation School'') on 10 August 1912. Several military officers were amongst the pioneers of Argentine aviation, including Jorge Newbery, a retired Argentine Navy officer. The School began to turn out several military pilots who participated in milestone events in Argentine aviation, such as the crossing of the Andes mountains.

In 1927 the '''' (General Directorate of Aeronautics) was created to coordinate the country's military aviation. In that same year, the Fábrica Militar de Aviones (''Military Aircraft Factory'', FMA) was founded in Córdoba, which would become the heart of the country's aviation industry.

By the 1940s there were several air units in the Army and the Navy, and the first step towards an independent force came on 11 February 1944 with the establishment of the Aeronautical Command, which would go on to become the Argentine Air Force on 4 January, 1945, an independent force on par with the Army and the Navy.

Immediately after the end of German Pulqui II, making Argentina the first country in Latin America and the sixth in the world to develop jet fighter technology on its own.

In 1952, the Air Force began flights to supply the early Antarctic scientific bases, expanding its activities in the Antarctic continent and establishing Marambio Base on 25 September 1969.

During the 1970s, the Air Force reequipped itself with modern aircraft for the period, including the Pucará, was used in substantial numbers.

The 60 aircraft. Due to the deteriorating economic situation, international opposition and political distrust upon the military, the Air Force was denied the resources needed to replace the war losses. This, coupled with diminishing budgets, led to a period of reduced activity and growing materiel obsolescence.

In the 1990s, the British embargo was officially eliminated and after economic and political failure attempts of getting surplus United States sold 36 refurbished A-4M Skyhawk (known as A-4AR Fightinghawks.) Since their reception, the A-4AR demonstrated being a worthy replacement of the ''Bravos'' and ''Charlies'' that fought during the war.

The FAA has been greatly involved in United Nations peacekeeping missions around the world. They sent a Boeing 707 to the 1991 Gulf War. Since 1994, the UN Air contingent (UNFLIGHT) in Cyprus under UNFICYP mandate is provided by the FAA<ref>[http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/misiones/chipre.html FAA site:United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP)]</ref>, achieving 10,000 flight hours (as of 2003) without any accidents <ref>[http://www.helis.com/database/go/ar_7th_air_brigade.php Helis.com Database]</ref>. The FAA has also since 2005 deployed Bell 212 helicopters to Haiti under MINUSTAH mandate. 

In early 2005, the top seventeen President Secretariat of State Intelligence knew about the drug traffic operations. 

The primary concerns of the Air Force nowadays are the establishment of a radar network for control of the country's airspace, the replacement of its older combat aircraft (Mirage III, Mirage V) and the incorporation of new technologies. The possibility of purchasing surplus French Air Force Mirage 2000C fighters, like the option chosen by the Brazilian Air Force, has been considered.

Since the last decade, the FAA had established good relations with neighbours Brazil, ''Ceibo'' in Argentina and ''Salitre'' in Chile.

In 2007, an FAA bio-jet fuel. The project, financed and directed by the Argentine Government (''''), made Argentina the second nation in the world to propel an aircraft with biojet fuel. The project intends to make the FAA less reliant on costly fossil fuels.

==Organization==
The Argentine Air Force is one of the three branches of the Argentine military, having equal status with the Army and the Navy. The President of Argentina is Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force as well as of the other branches of the military. 

The Air Force is headed by the Chief of the General Staff (''''), directly appointed and removed by the President. The Air Force Chief of Staff usually holds the rank of Brigadier General, the highest rank of the Air Force. The Chief of Staff is seconded by a Deputy Chief of the General Staff and four senior officers in charge of the Air Force's four Commands: the Air Operations Command, the Air Regions Command, the Personnel Command and the Materiel Command. 

The Air Operations Command ('''') is the branch of the Air Force responsible for aerospace defense, air operations, planning, training, technical and logistical support of the air units. Subordinate to the Air Operations Command are the Air Brigades (''''), the Air Force's major operative units. A total of eight Air Brigades are currently operational. Brigades are headquartered at Military Air Bases ('''', commonly abbreviated "BAM").

Each Air Brigade is made up of three Groups, each of which bear the same numeral as its mother Brigade. These groups include: 
*One '''Air Group''' (''''), which operates the aircraft assigned to the Brigade. The Air Group is divided into a variable number of Air Squadrons. Air Groups may be named according to their primary mission, for example an air group specialized in fighter operations receives the designation of Fighter Group (''Grupo de Caza''). Currently the Air Force includes three Fighter Groups (4th, 5th and 6th), one Attack Group (3rd), one Transport Group (1st) and three plain Air Groups (2nd, 7th and 9th). The 7th Air Group operates all the helicopters of the Air Force, while the 2nd includes a small reconnaissance unit as well as light transport aircraft. 9th Air Group is a light transport unit.
*One '''Technical Group''' (''''), in charge of the maintenance and repair of the Brigade's aircraft. 
*One '''Base Group''' (''''), responsible for the air base itself, weather forecasting, flight control, runway maintenance, etc. Base Groups also include Base Flights (''''), generally made up of two or three liaison aircraft.

The Personnel Command ('''') is responsible for the training, education, assignment and welfare of Air Force personnel. Under the control of the Personnel Command are the Military Aviation School (which educates the future officers of the Air Force), the Air Force Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) School and other educational and training units. 

The Materiel Command ('''') deals with planning and executing the Air Force's logistics regarding flying and ground materiel. Materiel Command includes "Quilmes" and "Río Cuarto " Materiel Areas (repairing and maintenance units) and "El Palomar" Logistical Area.

Air Regions Command ('''') is responsible for the control of air traffic, weather forecasting, aircraft and pilot registration (civilian), accident investigation (both civilian and military) and air communications. It is worth noting that Air Regions Command serves as the national authority regarding air transportation.
