'''Quiverfull''' er en konservativ evangelisk protestantisk kristen bevægelse hovedsagligt eksisterende i USA, men også med tilhængere i Canada <ref name="QF-Canda"></ref>, Australien, New Zealand, England og andre steder<ref name="hess"></ref>. Bevægelsen er kendetegnet ved at anse børn som en gave og velsignelse fra Gud som modtages med glæde<ref name="hess" />, og en afståelse fra alle former for prævention, inklusiv naturlig familie planlægning og sterilisation. Bevægelsen der på dansk kan oversættes til '''Koggerfuld''' er vokset stødt siden dens begyndelse i midt 1980erne og tæller i dag et sted mellem tusinder og små titusinde tilhængere på verdensplan.

== Navn ==
Navnet Quiverfull (Koggerfuld) er inspireret af tre vers fra kapitel 127 i Salmernes Bog fra Det Gamle Testamente, hvor mange børn metaforisk beskrives som et fuldt pilekogger.

<blockquote>'''v3''' Sønner er en gave fra Herren,<br>
moderlivets frugt er lønnen. <br>
<br>
'''v4'''  Som pile i krigerens hånd<br>
er sønner, man får i sin ungdom. <br>
<br>
'''v5'''  Lykkelig den mand, der fylder sit kogger med dem; <br>
de bliver ikke til skamme, <br>
når de taler til deres fjender i porten. <ref name=”SalmernesBog”>http://www.bibelselskabet.dk/danbib/web/sl/127b.htm "Salmernes Bog 127:3-5".</ref></blockquote>

== Historie ==
Quiverfull begyndte som en protest mod traditionelle protestantiske og anglikanske kirkesamfunds accept af præventionsmidler og som en modstrømning mod feminisme. Hvor understrømmen havde været der i årtier, blev der først sat ord på med Mary Prides bog ''The Way Home: Beyond Feminism, Back to Reality.'' fra 1985, der kan tages som startskuddet til Quiverfull-bevægelsen. Bogen beskriver Prides egen personlige rejse fra traditionelle feministisk synspunkter til hendes konvertering ind i en konservativ evangelisk kirke i 1977 og hvordan hun der fandt mening i et liv som kvinde og moder af børn og arbejde i hjemmet under mandens autoritet. Pride skrev at Biblen generelt krævede sådan en livsstil af alle gifte kristne kvinder, men at mange kristen kvinder var blevet snydt af feminisme til at acceptere prævention<ref name="pride"></ref><ref name="consvprots"></ref>.

== Tro ==
I Kernen af Quiverfulls tro ligger et ønske om at være lydig over for Guds bud i Biblen. Iblandt disse bud er »Bliv frugtbare og talrige, og opfyld vandet i havene! Og fuglene skal blive talrige på jorden!« (Første Mosebog 1:22<ref> http://www.bibelselskabet.dk/danbib/web/1mos/1b.htm "Første Mosebog 1:22".</ref>), »Men I skal blive frugtbare og talrige, I skal vrimle på jorden og blive talrige på den.« (Første Mosebog 9:7<ref> http://www.bibelselskabet.dk/danbib/web/1mos/9b.htm "Første Mosebog 9:7".</ref>), »Sønner er en gave fra Herren«("Salmernes Bog 127:3<ref name=”SalmernesBog”>http://www.bibelselskabet.dk/danbib/web/sl/127b.htm "Salmernes Bog 127:3-5".</ref>) samt forskellige afsnit der beskriver Gud åbne og lukke livmoderen("Første Mosebog" 20:18<ref> http://www.bibelselskabet.dk/danbib/web/1mos/20b.htm "Første Mosebog 20:18".</ref>, 29:31<ref> http://www.bibelselskabet.dk/danbib/web/1mos/29b.htm "Første Mosebog 29:31".</ref>, 30:22<ref> http://www.bibelselskabet.dk/danbib/web/1mos/30b.htm "Første Mosebog 30:22".</ref>, "Første Samuelsbog" 1:5-6, "Esajas' Bog" 66:9<ref>http://www.bibelselskabet.dk/danbib/web/es/66b.htm "Esajas' Bog" 66:9</ref>). Quiverfull tilhængere understreger at deres tro først og fremmest er en åben og imødegående tilgang til børn og muligheden for at sætte dem i verdenen. Prævention er forkastet som uforlignelig med denne holdning og derfor helst undgås.

'''Quiverfull''' is a movement among conservative evangelical Protestant Christian couples chiefly in the sterilization.<ref name="joyce"></ref><ref name="LifeSiteNews.com"></ref> Someone of this persuasion might call themselves a "quiver full", "full quiver", "quiverfull-minded", or simply "QF" Christian. Roman Catholics and some others might refer to the Quiverfull position as Providentialism,<ref name="open_embrace"></ref> while the popular press has recently referred to the movement as a manifestation of natalism.<ref name="cbn"></ref><ref name="nytimes"></ref> The movement and its corpus of literature have grown steadily since its inception.  Its adherents most likely number in the "thousands to low tens of thousands".<ref name="joyce"></ref>  It began to receive significant attention in the U.S. national press in 2004.

== Historical backdrop ==

Some of the beliefs held among Quiverfull adherents have been held among various Christians during prior eras of history. Initially, all Christian movements opposed the use of birth control. As birth control methods advanced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most Christian movements issued official statements against their use.

=== Anglican allowance of birth control and feminism ===

In 1930 the Anglican Church issued a statement permitting birth control "when there is a clearly felt moral obligation to limit or avoid parenthood and where there is a morally sound reason for avoiding complete abstinence."  Coinciding, a feminist movement which began about a decade earlier under American Birth Control League (which eventually became Planned Parenthood) founder Margaret Sanger emerged to advocate for modern birth control.<ref name="lobbying"></ref><ref name="sanger1"></ref>  In the decades that followed, birth control became gradually accepted among Protestants, even among the most conservative evangelicals.<ref name="flann"></ref><ref name="allen"></ref><ref name="affiliation"></ref><ref name="consvprots"></ref>

=== Early Quiverfull authors ===

:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''Also see: Feminism, Anti-feminism, and Birth control''

Within that context, Quiverfull as a modern Christian movement began to emerge.<ref name="explaindiffs"></ref> The movement was sparked most fully after the 1985 Mary Pride’s book ''The Way Home: Beyond Feminism, Back to Reality.'' 

In her book, Pride chronicled her journey away from what she stated were conversion to conservative evangelical Christianity in 1977, toward her discovery of happiness surrounding what she said was the Biblically mandated role of wives and mothers as bearers of children and workers in the home under the authority of a husband. Pride wrote that such a lifestyle was generally Biblically required of all married Christian women but that most Christian women had been unknowingly duped by feminism, importantly in  their acceptance of birth control.<ref name="pride"></ref><ref name="consvprots"></ref>

As the basis for her arguments, Pride selected numerous Bible verses to lay out what she felt was the Biblical role of women. These included verses she saw as containing her ideas of childbearing and non-usage of birth control, which she argued were opposed to what she called "the feminist agenda" by which she had formerly lived.  Pride's explanations became a spearheading basis of Quiverfull.   

The name of the Quiverfull movement comes from the Old Testament Bible verses in Psalm 127:3-5 that Pride cited in ''The Way Home''.<ref name="pride"></ref>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD:<BR>
and the fruit of the womb is his reward.<BR>
As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man;<BR>
so are children of the youth.<BR>
Happy is the man that hath his '''quiver full''' of them:<BR>
they shall not be ashamed,<BR>
but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.(emphasis added).KJV
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Pride stated in her book, "The church’s sin which has caused us to become unsavory salt incapable of uplifting the society around us is selfishness, lack of love, refusing to consider children an unmitigated blessing. In a word, family planning."<ref name="pride"></ref>

=== Consolidation and growth of movement===
After the publication of Pride’s ''The Way Home'', various church women and others took up her book and ideas and spread them through informal social networks. Around this time, numerous church pastors issued sermons in accord with Pride's ideas and various small publications and a few Quiverfull-oriented books emerged.  

As the digests, most notably ''The Quiverfull Digest''. The largely decentralized "Quiverfull" movement resulted.<ref name="joyce"></ref><ref name="nightline2"></ref> 

From their onset, Quiverfull ideas have sometimes had a rather polarizing effect between Christians who hold to the position and those who are skeptical of or disagree with them.<ref name="consvprots"></ref><ref name="protsandfp"></ref>

==Motivations==
=== Obedience to God ===
The core motivation expressed by Quiverfull authors and adherents is a desire to be obedient to God's commands in the Bible. Among these commands, "be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:22; 9:7), "behold, children are a gift of the Lord" (Psalm 127:3), and passages showing God acting to open and close the womb (Genesis 20:18, 29:31, 30:22; 1 Samuel 1:5-6; Isaiah 66:9) are interpreted as giving basis for their view. Quiverfull adherents typically maintain that their philosophy is first about an open, accepting and obedient attitude toward the possibility of birthing children. Within the view, this attitude may result in many, few or even no children, because God Himself maintains sole provenance over conception and birth.  The duty of the Quiverfull adherent is only to maintain an "open willingness" to joyfully receive and not thwart however many children God chooses to bestow.  Contraception in all its forms are seen as inconsistent with this attitude and are thus entirely avoided, as is abortion.

=== Missionary effort ===
Quiverfull's principal authors and its adherents also describe their motivation as a missionary effort to raise up many Christian children to affect the world for the cause of the Christian religion.<ref name="hess"></ref> Its distinguishing viewpoint is to eagerly receive children as blessings from God,<ref name="hess"></ref><ref name="campN"></ref> eschewing all forms of sterilization.<ref name="joyce"></ref><ref name="pride"></ref>

=== Population and demography ===

According to journalist Kathryn Joyce,

</ref>}}

=== Conservative politics ===

Quiverfull authors Hess and Hess, along with Joyce, also connect the proliferation of conservative politics as a motivation behind Quiverfull. Hess and Hess state,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When at the height of the Reagan Revolution the conservative faction in Washington was enforced with squads of new conservative congressmen, legislators often found themselves handcuffed by lack of like-minded staff. There simply weren't enough conservatives trained to serve in Washington in the lower and middle capacities.<ref name="hess"></ref>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Hess and Hess continue by envisioning that the offspring of Quiverfull families might enter national and local politics to bring conservative majorities, publicly-funded education to bring the teaching of creationism, and business to adjure companies to adhere to what adherents see as Christian sensibilities.<ref name="hess"></ref><ref name="joyce"></ref>

== Beliefs ==
thumb|120px|right| The cover of the 1990 ''Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ'' by Rick and Jan Hess.

The principal Quiverfull belief is that Christians should maintain a strongly welcoming attitude toward the possibility of bearing children. With minor exception, adherents reject birth control use as completely incompatible with this belief.

===Majority doctrine===

Most Quiverfull adherents consider children to be unqualified blessings, gifts which should be received happily from God. Quiverfull authors Rick and Jan Hess argued for this belief in their 1990 book.

<blockquote>"Behold, children are a gift of the Lord." (Psa. 127:3) Do we really believe that? If children are a gift from God, let’s for the sake of argument ask ourselves what other gift or blessing from God we would reject. Money? Would we reject great wealth if God gave it? Not likely! How about good health? Many would say that a man’s health is his most treasured possession. But children? Even children given by God? "That’s different!" some will plead! All right, is it different? God states right here in no-nonsense language that children are gifts. Do we believe His Word to be true?<ref name="hess"></ref>
</blockquote>
Quiverfull authors such as Pride, Provan, and Hess extend this idea to mean that if one child is a blessing, then each additional child is likewise a blessing and not something to be viewed as economically burdensome or unaffordable. When a couple seeks to control family size via birth control they are thus "rejecting God's blessings" he might otherwise give, and possibly breaking his commandment to "be fruitful and multiply".<ref name="pride"></ref><ref name="provan">. Quote and its chapter available at http://www.jesus-passion.com/contraception.htm</ref><ref name="hess"></ref><ref name="bythedozen"></ref>
thumb|120px|right|[[Charles D. Provan's 1989 ''The Bible and Birth Control'' is credited as strengthening the theological justification for the Quiverfull movement.]]
Accordingly, Quiverfull theology opposes the general acceptance among Protestant Christians of deliberately limiting family size or spacing children through birth control. For example, Mary Pride argued, "God commanded that sex be at least potentially fruitful (that is, not deliberately unfruitful).... All forms of sex that shy away from maritial fruitfulness are perverted."<ref name="pride"></ref> Adherents believe that God himself controls via Providence how many and how often children are conceived and born, pointing to Bible verses that describe God acting to "open and close the womb" (see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2020:18;&version=49; Genesis 20:18], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2029:31;&version=49; 29:31], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2030:22;&version=49; 30:22]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%201:5-6;&version=49; 1 Samuel 1:5-6]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2066:9;&version=49; Isaiah 66:9]).<ref name="hess"></ref><ref name="scott"></ref> Hess and Hess state that couples "just need to trust God to provide them with the perfect number of children for their situation."<ref name="hess"></ref>  

Rejection of birth control by some Quiverfull adherents is based upon the belief that the Genesis creation and post-Noahic flood Bible passages to "be fruitful and multiply" (see [http://bible.cc/genesis/1-22.htm Genesis 1:22]; [http://bible.cc/genesis/9-7.htm 9:7]) are un-rescinded Biblical commandments. For example, Charles D. Provan argues,

<blockquote>
"Be fruitful and multiply" ... is a command of God, indeed the first command to a married couple. Birth control obviously involves disobedience to this command, for birth control attempts to prevent being fruitful and multiplying. Therefore birth control is wrong, because it involves disobedience to the Word of God. Nowhere is this command done away with in the entire Bible; therefore it still remains valid for us today.<ref name="provan">. Quote and its chapter available at http://www.jesus-passion.com/contraception.htm</ref>
</blockquote>

Quiverfull advocates such as Hess and Hess, Devil deceives Christian couples into using birth control so that children God otherwise willed to create are prevented from being born.<ref name="hess"></ref><ref name="demoss"></ref><ref name="scott"></ref> A Quiverfull adherent quoted in 1991 in the ''Calgary Herald'' made the statement: "Children are made in God's image, and the enemy hates that image, so the more of them he can prevent from being born, the more he likes it."<ref name="QF-Canda"></ref>

====Infertility====
Adherents view infertility treatments as a usurpation of God's providence and accordingly reject them.

===Minority doctrine===

Not all Quiverfull families and authors would agree with each statement made by the movement's principal authors. 

Samuel Owens considers that there may be aspects of a fallen universe that sometimes justify an option to use a non-potentially abortive birth control method. Example situations include serious illnesses, inevitable Caesarian sections, and other problematic situations such as disabling mental instability and serious marital disharmony. Owen additionally argues that birth control may be permissible for married couples called to a "higher moral purpose" than having children, such as caring long-term for many missionaries in a dangerous location.<ref name="Owen"></ref>

Despite some variances, all Quiverfull families and authors agree that God's normative ideal for happy, healthy and prosperous married couples is to take no voluntary actions to prevent having children.<ref name="hess"></ref><ref name="campN"></ref>

== Practices ==
===Non-use of contraception===

Quiverfull adherents maintain that God "opens and closes the womb" of a woman on a case-by-case basis, and that attempts to regulate fertility are a subjugation of divine power. Thus, the key practice of a Quiverfull married couple is to not use any form of birth control and to maintain continual "openness to children", to the possibility of conception, during routine sexual intercourse irrespective of timing of the month during the ovulation cycle. This is considered by Quiverfull adherents to be a principal, if not the primary, aspect of their Christian calling in submission to the lordship of Christ.<ref name="joyce2"></ref> 
 
A healthy young Quiverfull couple might thereby have a baby every two years, meaning that as many as 10 children or more might be born during a couple's fertile years. In reality, however, most Quiverfull families do not become that large because general health problems or lactational amenorrhea, although the method is not certain.

===Family organization, homeschooling, homesteading===

Quiverfull authors and adherents advocate for and seek to model a return to Biblical Patriarchy. Families are typically arranged with the mother as a homemaker under the authority of her husband with the children under the authority of both. Parents seek to largely shelter their children from aspects of culture they as parents deem adversarial to their type of conservative Christianity. 

Additionally, Quiverfull families are strongly inclined toward homeschooling and homesteading in a rural area. However, exceptions exist in substantial enough portion to where these latter two items are general and often idealized correlates to Quiverfull practices and not integral parts of them.<ref name="patri"></ref>

===Sterilization reversals===

Quiverfull adherents Brad and Dawn Irons run ''Blessed Arrows Sterilization Reversal Ministry''. The couple advocates for Quiverfull ideas while providing funding, physician referrals, and support to Protestants wishing to undergo sterilization reversal surgery.<ref name="reverse"></ref> Protestants such as Bill Gothard also advocate for reversals, saying that sterilized couples have "cut off children" but should instead devoted themselves to "raising up godly seed".
