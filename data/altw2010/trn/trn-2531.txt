}}                                          The '''First Minister of Scotland''' (; ) is the head of the devolved Scottish Government, which was established in 1999 along with the Scottish Cabinet and is primarily responsible for the formulation, development and presentation of Scottish government policy.<ref name="role">{{cite web |url=
http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Scottish-Cabinet |title=Scottish Cabinet and Ministers |publisher=Scottish Government |accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> Additional functions of the First Minister include promoting and representing Scotland, in an official capacity, at home and abroad and responsibility for constitutional affairs, as they relate to devolution and the Scottish Government.<ref name="role"/>

The First Minister is a monarch. Members of the Cabinet and junior ministers of the Scottish Government as well as the Scottish law officers, are appointed by the First Minister. As head of the Scottish Government, the First Minister is directly accountable to the Scottish Parliament for his or her actions and the actions of the wider executive.

Alex Salmond, of the Scottish National Party (SNP) is the current First Minister of Scotland.<ref name="Salmond"></ref> He was elected as the Parliament's nominee for First Minister on 16 May, 2007 and was sworn in at the Court of Session the following day.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6663509.stm "MSPs approve new Scottish cabinet"], BBC News online, accessed 20 May 2007</ref> 

==History==
 
Following a referendum in 1997, in which the Scottish electorate gave their consent; a Scottish Parliament and devolved Scottish Government were established by the Labour government of health, education and justice.<ref name="history"></ref> Devolution resulted in administrative and legislative changes to the way Scotland was governed, and resulted in the establishment of a post of First Minister to be head of the devolved Scottish Government. The term "First Minister" is analogous to the use of sub-national entities, such as the provinces and territories of provinces of states of Australia.<ref name="premier">{{cite web |url=

The Secretary of State was a member of the British Cabinet and appointed by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to have responsibility for the domestic affairs of Scotland. Since 1999, the Secretary of State has a much reduced role as a result of the transfer of responsibilities to the Scottish Parliament and Government.<ref name="Secretary">{{cite web |url=

==Term==
There is no term of office for a First Minister. The First Minister is a Member of the Scottish Parliament and like all ministers in the Scottish Government, holds office "at Her Majesty's pleasure".<ref name="powers">{{cite web |url=
http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--d.htm#45 |title=Section 45 - Scotland Act 1998 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref> However to gain supply (control of exchequer funds) the government must be answerable to, and acceptable to, the Scottish Parliament, in reality the convention "at her Majesty's pleasure" means "Scottish Parliament". Whenever the office of First Minister falls vacant, the Sovereign is responsible for appointing the new incumbent; the appointment is formalised at a meeting between the First Minister designate and the Sovereign. In accordance with the Scotland Act, the Sovereign must appoint the individual who has been nominated by the Scottish Parliament to serve as First Minister.<ref name="powers"/> Given the nature of the mixed member proportional representation system that is used to elected Members of the Scottish Parliament, it is extremely rare for a single party to gain an overall majority of seats in Parliament.<ref name="pr"></ref> As a consequence, it is normally determined by Parliament that the leader of the largest party, or the leader of any coalition that is formed in the Parliament, be nominated to Her Majesty for appointment - although this need not be the case. Theoretically, any member of the Scottish Parliament, from any party grouping represented there, can be nominated to the monarch for appointment.<ref name="powers"/> The only requirement is that the Scottish Parliament pass a resolution to that effect.<ref name="powers"/>

After a general election to the Scottish Parliament, A First Minister must be nominated within a period of 28 days following the election.<ref name="powers"/> Under the terms of the Act, if Parliament fails to nominate a First Minister, within this time frame, it will be dissolved and a fresh election must be held.<ref name="powers"/> If an incumbent First Minister is defeated in a general election, he does not immediately demit office. He only leaves office when the Scottish Parliament nominates a new individual to be presented to the monarch for appointment.<ref name="powers"/> This is normally the second item of business on the agenda of a newly convened session of the Scottish Parliament - after the election of a Presiding Officer.

Once they have had an audience with the monarch, and have accepted office, the First Minister takes the Official Oath, as set out in the Promissory Oaths Act 1868.<ref name="oath"></ref> The oath is tendered by the Parliament House in Edinburgh.<ref name="oath"/> The Official Oath is in the following form:

The period in office of a First Minister is not linked to the term of Members of the Scottish Parliament. The Scotland Act set out a four year maximum term for each session of Parliament.<ref name="elections">{{cite web |url=

However if a simple majority of MSPs voted a no-confidence motion in the First Minister/Government, that would trigger a 28-day period for the nomination of a replacement; should that time period expire without the nomination of a new First Minister, then an extraordinary election would have to be called.<ref name="elections2">{{cite web |url=

The First Minister, once appointed continues in office as the head of the devolved Scottish Government until either they resign, are dismissed (in reality something not likely to happen except in exceptional circumstances) or die in office. Resignation can be triggered off by the passage of a Motion of No Confidence in the First Minister or the Scottish Government or by rejecting a Motion of Confidence in the Scottish Parliament.<ref name="powers"/> In those situations, the First Minister must tender his resignation to the monarch.<ref name="powers"/> In doing so he tenders the resignation of all Scottish Government Ministers who must leave office with immediate effect.<ref name="powers"/> In such circumstances, it is the responsibility of the Presiding Officer to appoint an individual to serve as First Minister in the interim, until the Scottish Parliament determines on a new nominee to be presented to the Sovereign for formal appointment.<ref name="powers"/>

==Powers==

The role and powers of the First Minister are set out in Sections 45 to 49 of the Scotland Act 1998.<ref name="powers"/>

Following their appointment, the First Minister may then nominate ministers to sit in the Scottish Cabinet and Junior Ministers to form the Scottish Government. Ministers, hold office at Her Majesty's Pleasure and may be removed from office, at any time, by the First Minister. The First Minister also has the power to appoint the Chief Legal Officers of the Scottish Government - the Solicitor General  but only with the support of the Scottish Parliament. 

The First Minister is responsible to the Scottish Parliament for his/her actions and the actions of the overall government. MSPs can scrutinise the activities of the First Minister and his Cabinet by tabling written questions or by asking oral questions in the Scottish Parliament. Direct questioning of the First Minister takes place each Thursday at noon, when Parliament is sitting. The 30 minute session enables MSPs to ask questions of the First Minister, on any issue. The leaders of the largest opposition parties have an allocation of questions and are allowed to question the First Minister each week. Opposition leaders normally ask an opening question to the First Minister, relating to his meeting with the Scottish Cabinet, or when he next expects to meet the Prime Minister, and then follow this up by asking a supplementary question on an issue of their choosing. 

In addition to direct questioning, the First Minister is also able to deliver oral statements to the Scottish Parliament chamber, after which members are invited to question the First Minister on the substance of the statement. For example, at the beginning of each parliamentary term, the First Minister normally delivers a statement, setting out the legislative programme of the government, or a statement of government priorities over the forthcoming term.<ref name="priorities">{{cite web |url=

Associated with the office of First Minister, there is also the post of Deputy First Minister.
Unlike the office of First Minister, the post of Deputy is not recognised in statute and confers no extra status on the holder. Like the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister is an elected Member of the Scottish Parliament and a member of the Scottish Government. From 1999 to 2007, when Scotland was governed by a Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition, the leader of the Liberal Democrats - the junior government party, was given the role of Deputy First Minister; a title which they held in conjunction with another ministerial portfolio. For example, Nicol Stephen, Deputy First Minister from 2005 to 2007, simultaneously held the post of Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning. 

On two occasions since 1999, the Deputy First Minister has assumed the role of 'Acting' First Minister, inheriting the powers of the First Minister in their absence or incapacitation. From 11 October 2000 to 26 October 2000, following the death in office of the then First Minister Donald Dewar, his deputy Jim Wallace became Acting First Minister, until the Labour party appointed a new leader, and consequently First Minister.<ref name="acting">{{cite web |url=
http://www.worldstatesmen.org/United_Kingdom.html#Scotland |title=World Statesmen - United Kingdom, Scotland |publisher=World Statesmen  |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> Wallace also became Acting First Minister between 8 November 2001 and 22 November 2001, following the resignation of Henry McLeish.<ref name="acting"/>

Als '''Erster Minister''' (''engl.'' '' '''First Minister''' '';gäl.'' '' '''Prìomh Mhinistear na h-Alba''''') wird seit der Gründung des Schottischen Parlaments 1999 der schottische Regierungschef bezeichnet. Durch diese Bezeichnung wird bewusst vom Premierminister unterschieden, der Regierungschef des gesamten Vereinigten Königreiches ist. Derzeitiger Amtsinhaber ist Alex Salmond. 

Der Erste Minister ist ein Mitglied des Schottischen Parlaments und wird von diesem nominiert. Die offizielle Ernennung erfolgt durch den Monarchen des Vereinigten Königreichs. Zu den Befugnissen des Ersten Ministers gehören die Nominierung der Kabinettsmitglieder, der Staatssekretäre sowie der Staatsanwälte. Er ist dem Schottischen Parlament gegenüber rechenschaftspflichtig für seine Handlungen und die der gesamten Regierung.

== Geschichte ==
Im Jahr 1997 stimmten die schottischen Wähler in einem Referendum der Gründung eines Schottischen Parlaments und einer Regionalregierung zu. Durch diese Institutionen sollte eine gewisse Unabhängigkeit in Schottland betreffenden Bereichen wie dem Gesundheitssystem oder dem Bildungswesen gewährt werden. Auch eigene Gesetze kann das Schottische Parlament seit dieser Zeit in begrenztem Umfang erlassen. Das Referendum wurde von der britischen Labour-Regierung unter Tony Blair umgesetzt und führte zu Veränderungen in der Verwaltung und Gesetzgebung Schottlands. Eine der Konsequenzen war die Schaffung des Postens eines Ersten Ministers als Chef des Schottischen Parlaments.

Der Begriff des Ersten Ministers wird wie der des Premierministers verwendet. Er wurde in Anlehnung an die Regierungschefs untergeordneter Verwaltungseinheiten wie der Provinzen und Territorien Kanadas, der Provinzen Südafrikas oder der Staaten und Territorien Australiens gewählt.

Vor der Selbstbestimmung wurden mit den Kompetenzen des Ersten Ministers vergleichbare Aufgaben durch den Britischen Kabinetts das vom Premierminister berufen wurde. Seit 1999 hat er nur noch die Aufgabe Kompetenzen an das Schottische Parlament und die Schottische Regierung zu übertragen. Der momentane Minister Verteidigungsminister.
