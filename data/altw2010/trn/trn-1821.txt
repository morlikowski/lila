'''`Īsā''' (Israels barn" (banī isrā'īl) för att vägleda dem med en ny Injīl' (Maria (arabiska: Maryam) genom jungfruelig befruktning, en mirakulös händelse vilken inträffade genom Guds (arabiska: Allah) påbud. För att hjälpa honom med sitt uppdrag gavs Jesus förmågan att utföra korsfäst, utan upptagen levande till himlen. Muslimska traditioner berättar att han kommer att återvända till jorden vid den sista tiden för att återupprätta rättvisan och besegra 'al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl' (översatt "den falska Messias", också känd som Antikrist) och islams fiender. Liksom alla profeter inom islam anses Jesus ha varit en muslim, sedan han predikade för folket att anamma den enda vägen i underkastelse till Guds vilja. Islam förkastar starkt att Jesus var Gud eller Guds son och menar att han var en vanlig man som, liksom andra profeter, blivit utvald att sprida Guds bud. Muslimerna menar alltså att Isa sändes till jorden av gud som profet, men att budskapet förvrängdes efter hans död<ref>Esposito, J. L. 1998. ''Islam - The Straight Path.Third Edition''.

Islams skrifter förbjuder föreningen av människor jämlika med Gud (shirk) och betonar uppfattningen om en Gud, alltså monoteism (tawhīd). Isa ses inom islam som en föregångare till Muhammed och anses ha förutsagt den senares ankomst.

'''messenger of God who had been sent to guide the Injīl'' (gospel).<ref> virginal conception, a miraculous event which occurred by the decree of crucified, but rather he was raised alive up to heaven. Islamic traditions narrate that he will return to earth near the day of judgment to restore justice and defeat ''al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl'' (''lit''. "the false messiah", also known as the shirk''), emphasizing the notion of God's divine oneness (''tawhīd''). Numerous titles are given to Jesus in the Qur'an, such as ''al-Masīḥ'' ("the messiah; the anointed one" i.e. by means of blessings), although it does not correspond with the meaning accrued in Christian belief. Jesus is seen in Islam as a precursor to Muhammad, and is believed by Muslims to have foretold the latter's coming.<ref name="EoI-Isa"/><ref>Fasching, deChant (2001) p. 241</ref>

==Etymology==
The Anglicized name of ''Jesus'' is derived from the Latin ''Iēsus'', which in turn comes from the Greek  (Iēsoûs).<ref name="EoQ"> Encyclopedia of the Qur'an, Jesus </ref> The Qur'anic reference as 'Isa has puzzled Western scholars and several theories have been proposed.<ref name="EoQ"/> One theory is that "''y-sh-' ,'' the Hebrew consonants of ''Yeshua'', have been reversed to give '' 's-y'', the Arabic consonants of `Īsā."<ref name="EoQ"/> Another theory, according to the ''Encyclopedia of the Qur'an'', is that "the Jews called Jesus "Esau" (Hebrew 'Esaw) out of hatred and that Muhammad learned this name from them not realizing that it was an insult." In support of this is the argument that the Arabic Esau is written as 'Isu, and that this may have been assimilated to `Īsā. Opposing this theory is the lack of evidence that the Jews ever called Jesus Esau. Further, a passage in the Quran charges Jews for insulting Jesus' mother and that those Christians who were acquaintances of Muhammad would have corrected him had Muhammad not realized that it is a Jewish insult to Jesus.<ref name="EoQ"/>

A third theory is that the Qur'an deliberately used the word `Īsā to assimilate it to Musa (Moses) because they were sometimes paired. This also occurs in some modern languages, such as Slovak (Ježiš - Mojžiš) or Czech (Ježíš - Mojžíš). Other examples of assonant pairs include  (Saul and Goliath),  (Gog and Magog), and so on.<ref name="EoQ"/> The last theory is that Christians in Arabia had coined the term `Īsā from the Syriac forms of Yeshu or Ishu. The Arabic words that are borrowed from Aramaic or Syriac are often employed by '' 'ayn ''. Furthermore, the Manichaean fragments provide an evidence for dropping the final 'ayin of the borrowed Hebrew terms. But there is no evidence that the term `Īsā had been in use in pre-Islamic times. "There is however a monastery in Syria known as `Īsāniyya as early as 571 C.E."<ref name="EoQ"/>

==Life==
===Birth===

Muslims believe in the virginal conception of Jesus by Mary (ar: ''Maryam''), which is recounted throughout several passages in the Qur'an. According to the Qur'anic narrative, Mary had withdrawn into a temple and was visited by the "Spirit of God," an agent of divine action or communication commonly identified in Islam with the angel Gabriel (ar: ''Jibreel'') but also with the created spirit from God by which he enlivened Adam.<ref>Griffith, Sidney H. "Holy Spirit ." Encyclopaedia of the Quran</ref><ref>See:
* 
* "Isa", Encyclopedia of Islam.</ref> He proclaimed to her the conception of Jesus. Mary was startled, for she had vowed her virginity to God and intended to retain it.<ref></ref> The angel reassured her, stating that such a conception was easy for God, who wished to make from her a sign (''āya'') to men and a mercy (''raḥma'') from Him.<ref></ref> The Qur'an describes the conception as the result of a creative decree made by God, similar to the creation of Adam. Some Qur'anic exegetes describe the event of conception as the angel's breathing into the cloak of Mary; which, upon putting it on, resulted in Jesus being conceived. Afterwards, Mary withdrew "to a distant place."<ref name="EoI-Isa"/>

After delivering Jesus, Mary was overtaken by the pangs of childbirth, resting near the trunk of a palm tree. Jesus then addressed her from the cradle, to instruct her to shake the tree and obtain its fruits, and also to allay Mary's fears of a scandal surrounding his conception. She then showed the new-born to her family, and in silencing immodest rumors he declared: "Lo, I am God's servant; God has given me the Book, and made me a Prophet. Blessed he has made me, wherever I may be; and He has enjoined me to pray, and to give alms, so long as I live, and likewise to cherish my mother."<ref name="EoI-Isa"/><ref></ref>

According to Islamic texts, Jesus was divinely chosen to preach the message of revealed to Jesus a new scripture, the ''Injīl'' (gospel), while also declaring the truth of the previous revelation, the Torah. The Qur'an speaks favorably of the ''Injīl'', which it describes as a scripture that fills the hearts of its followers with meekness and pity. Muslims believe that these scriptures had become distorted over time in text, interpretation, or both.<ref>See:

The Qur'an states that Jesus was aided by a group of disciples (''hawāriyūn'') who believed in Jesus' message, and termed themselves the ''ansār'' ("helpers") of God. He was also strengthened by the same holy spirit that visited his mother Mary.<ref>See:

===Ascension===

thumb|right|220px|Ascension of Jesus in old Turkish painting.<ref></ref>
Islamic texts categorically deny the crucifixion and death of Jesus at the hands of the Jews.<ref name="EoI-Isa"/> The Qur'an states that the Jews sought to kill Jesus, but they did not kill nor crucify him, although a likeness of it was shown to them. Instead, he was raised alive unto God:<ref name="EoQ-cross"> Neal Robinson, Crucifixion, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an </ref> }}

According to some Muslim traditions, Jesus was replaced by a double; others suggest it was Simon of Cyrene, or one of the disciples such as Judas Iscariot. A minority of commentaries of Ismaili or rationalist (''falāsifa'') leaning affirmed the crucifixion by arguing that Jesus' body had been crucified, but his spirit had ascended. However, this interpretation was generally rejected, and according to the ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', there was unanimous agreement amongst the scholars in denying the crucifixion.<ref>The Encyclopedia of Islam further elaborates: "The denial, furthermore, is in perfect agreement with the logic of the Qur’an. The Biblical stories reproduced in it (e.g., Job, Moses, Joseph etc.) and the episodes relating to the history of the beginning of Islam demonstrate that it is “God's practice” (sunnat Allah ) to make faith triumph finally over the forces of evil and adversity. “So truly with hardship comes ease”, (XCIV, 5, 6). For Jesus to die on the cross would have meant the triumph of his executioners; but the Quran asserts that they undoubtedly failed: “Assuredly God will defend those who believe”; (XXII, 49). He confounds the plots of the enemies of Christ (III, 54)." (cf. `Isa, ''Encyclopedia of Islam'')</ref> Modern commentators such as M. Hayek interpret the verse to say that the crucifixion "seemed thus to them" [i.e. the Jews].<ref name="EoI-Isa"/>

===Second coming===

Muslims believe that Jesus will return at a time close to the end of the world. One Qur'anic verse alludes to Jesus' future return as follows:<ref name="EoI-Isa"/> }}

According to Islamic tradition, Jesus' descent will be in the midst of wars fought by the al-Masīh ad-Dajjāl'', "false messiah") and his followers.<ref name="S209">Sonn (2004) p. 209</ref> Jesus will descend at the point of a white arcade in Damascus, dressed in yellow robes - his head anointed. He will then join the Mahdi in his war against the Dajjal. Jesus, considered in Islam as a Muslim, will abide by the Islamic teachings. Eventually, Jesus will slay the Dajjal, and then everyone from the people of the book (''ahl al-kitāb'', referring to Jews and Christians) will believe in him.  Thus, there will be one community, that of Islam.<ref name="EoI-Isa"/>

After the death of the Mahdi, Jesus will assume leadership. This is a time associated in Islamic narrative with universal peace and justice. Islamic texts also allude to the appearance of Ya'juj and Ma'juj (known also as Gog and Magog), ancient tribes which will disperse and cause destruction on earth. God, in response to Jesus' prayers, will kill them by sending a type of worm in the napes of their necks.<ref name="S209"/> Jesus' rule is said to be around forty years, after which he will die. Muslims will then perform the funeral prayer for him and then bury him in the city of Medina in a grave left vacant beside Muhammad, Abu Bakr, and Umar (companions of Muhammad and the first and second Muslim caliphs respectively).<ref name="EoI-Isa"/>

thumb|right|Mary and Jesus in old Persian Shi'a miniature.
Jesus is described by various means in the Qur'an. The most common reference to Jesus occurs in the form of "Ibn Maryam" (son of Mary), sometimes preceded with another title. Jesus is also recognised as a prophet (''nabī'') and messenger (''rasūl'') of God. The terms ''wadjih'' ("worthy of esteem in this world and the next"), ''mubārak'' ("blessed", or "a source of benefit for others"), ''`abd-Allāh'' (servant of God) are all used in the Qur'an in reference to Jesus.<ref name="EoI-Isa"/>

Another title frequently mentioned is ''al-Masīḥ'', which translates to "the Christian concept of Messiah, as Islam regards all prophets, including Jesus, to be mortal and without any share in divinity. Muslim exegetes explain the use of the word ''masīh'' in the Qur'an as referring to Jesus' status as the one anointed by means of blessings and honors; or as the one who helped cure the sick, by anointing the eyes of the blind, for example.<ref name="EoI-Isa"/> Qur'anic verses also employ the term "''kalimatullah''" (meaning the "word of God") as a descriptor of Jesus, which is interpreted as a reference to the creating word of God, uttered at the moment of Jesus' conception;<ref>, cf. Encyclopedia of Islam</ref> or as recognition of Jesus' status as a messenger of God, speaking on God's behalf.<ref name="EoI-Isa"/>
