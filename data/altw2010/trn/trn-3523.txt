At the start both Massa and Kubica started well yet Massa managed to pass Kubica's BMW. Kovalainen jumped this chance and advanced into fourth as the pack traveled into the first corner. Further back at the grid, Vettel's car was damaged at turn four, with its engine blown at turn five. Hamilton completed the first lap in ninth, behind Alonso in his Renault. Button was hit from behind and punctured his rear tire. He pitted before rejoining the race

On lap two Hamilton crashed into the back of Alonso's Renault, destroying his own front wing and a chance of winning points. Piquet also spun in his Renault, after complaining for gearbox trouble during the Coulthard had also pitted, having a puncture as well.

Lap three saw Trulli, Rosberg and Webber battling for the 6th, 7th and 8th places respectively, though none were able to pass the other during the first stage of the race. At the front, Räikkönen passed Kubica for the second place and putting two Ferrari cars ahead of the rest. At the end of the lap saw Heidfeld in fourth place, having overtaken Kovalainen at turn 10 despite making a mistake.

On lap 18, Kubica entered the pits for refueling. Rosberg soon followed suit in his Williams. At the back of the pack Button tried to pass Coulthard from the inside of turn 6 and it went wrong. Button was not able to respond with Coulthard blocking the inside for passing and crashed into the Red Bull, damaging his front wing and his suspension. Eventually Button retired on lap 20.

Later on, Piquet's Renault developed enough gearbox trouble and retired on lap 41. In the front, Webber passed Rosberg for 7th, and started chasing Trulli's Toyota hard. Despite the Australian spending the entire latter third of the race chasing Trulli, a pass was never materialized. Eventually Webber settled for 7th.
