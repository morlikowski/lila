'''Fleshies''' are a band from Oakland, California signed to Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles. They are known for their outlandish stage presence, their left-wing politics and their non-stop world touring schedule. From their inception they were an influential presence at events such as Geekfest, held in the late 1990's.

Member John Geek also plays in the band Harbinger with Robert Eggplant and Aaron Cometbus, who have released one album, ''Challenging the Prevailing Judeo-Christian Doomsday Mentality'', to date.
