==History==

It is said that the sage Valmiki, the author of epic Ramayana, lived here and Sri Rama also stayed here on the way back to Ayodhya after his conquests of Lanka. The legend goes further to establish that seetha Devi after being rejected by Rama gave birth to her twins Lava and Kusha in this Avani. 

The hill to the west of Kolar, called the ''Satasringa Parvata'' or 'Hundred-peaked Mountain' is 'Antharagangae', associated with story of Parasurama, and his fight with king Kartaviryarjuna over Surabhi(the divine cow). As the story goes: King Kartavirya Arjuna (Sahasrarjuna) and his army visited Jamadagni, Parasurama's father, when the king demanded the magical cow from Jamadagni. When Jamadagni refused, the King sent his soldiers to take the cow, but Parashurama killed the entire army and the king with his axe. In return, the princes beheaded Jamadagni. Thus, Parasuram takes an oath to behead the entire Kshatriya race, which is said to have taken place on the hills.  It is said that the Kolahala, on the death of Kartaviryarjuna, gave its name to the town, which later become Kolar. Kannada, Tamil and Telugu are the main languages spoken in the district of Kolar.
