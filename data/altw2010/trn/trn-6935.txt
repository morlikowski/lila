'''Trevi''' (Latin: Clitunno river system. It is 10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) SSE of Foligno and 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) north of Spoleto.
thumb|left|View of Trevi.
The population of the ''comune'' was c. 8,000 in 2004, with the town proper accounting for about half of that; the rest lives in the ''frazioni'' of Borgo,  Manciano, terzieri of Castello, Matiggia e Piano; they come into play only for the Palio.

Most of the town, densely inhabited and of decidedly medieval aspect, lies on sharply sloping terrain, only the very center being more or less flat. It commands one of the best views in Umbria, extending over 50&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi) in most westerly directions. Trevi is served by the main rail line from Rome to Ancona as well as the line from Florence to Rome via Perugia.

==Geography==

The territory of the ''comune'', extends over 71&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;km (27.7&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi.) from the valley (210&nbsp;m) to Mts.&nbsp;Brunette (1422&nbsp;m/4665&nbsp;feet) and Serano (1429&nbsp;m/4688&nbsp;feet) and can be divided into three more or less equal zones: plain, hills, and mountain; each with its own characteristic vegetation. In the plain, the very fertile land is well irrigated by many watercourses, heirs for the most part to the "Lacus Clitorius" of Antiquity, and is suited to annual crops. The hills, of a very loose alkaline limestone with excellent drainage, are an ideal terrain for the intensive and highly specialized cultivation of olive trees, that produce a very characteristic and highly prized oil. Finally, the mountains are clothed in meadows and forests, primarily deciduous.

The natural environment of the territory as a whole remains largely unspoiled, this despite being significantly populated for millennia. The mountainous area is now witnessing a considerable depopulation &mdash; as elsewhere in Italy, in the second half of the 20th century settlements at the highest elevations have been rapidly losing their inhabitants to the plains. The most important growth areas since the period following World War&nbsp;II have been Borgo Trevi (commercial, residential and offices), Pietrarossa (industrial) and Matigge (light and medium industry, commercial).

Many rivers and canals, none of them very large, run in a general South-to-North direction, converging into a single river near Marroggia that had been subject to frequent torrential overflows with sudden and disastrous results.

The most important of the year-round watercourses is the Clitunno River, celebrated in Antiquity as the Propertius, Addison, Byron and Carducci.

Trevi borders the following municipalities: Campello sul Clitunno, Castel Ritaldi, Foligno, Montefalco, Sellano, Spoleto.

==History==

In Antiquity, 5th‑century Empire, when St. Francis, who is known to have visited the area and to have advised people to bathe there.

In antiquity Trevi is said to have had jurisdiction over much of the valley below, all the way to the Lombard viceroyalty (it. ''gastaldato''), then, in the early 13th century, freed itself of outside rulership to become a free commune. It generally allied itself with Perugia in order to defend itself from nearby Spoleto, and fought several wars with other neighboring communes, with varying outcomes, including invasion by Spoleto in the 14th century and a brief but unhappy rule of the Trinci warlords of Foligno. In 1438 Trevi passed under the temporal rule of the Church as part of the legation of Perugia, and thenceforth its history merges first with that of the States of the Church, then (1860) with the united Kingdom of Italy.

Trevi's best fortunes were in the 15th century, when its commercial importance was such that it was called "il porto secco" &mdash; the dry port. In 1470, along with Foligno, Trevi became the fourth town in Italy to have a printing press, managed by the first known printing company. The wealth of this period can still be seen in a number of Renaissance mansions in town.

==Main sights==

Trevi is enclosed in two circuits of medieval walls; in the late 20th century, the inner circuit was shown to be of Roman origin.

Trevi has about twenty old churches, several of which are of note:
*The ''Romanesque building with a carved door and an apse with carved corbels, the interior of which was significantly reworked in the 18th century.
*The ''Madonna delle Lacrime'' is a medieval conventual church with large votive frescoes, including an Adoration of the Magi by Pietro Perugino, his last known signed and dated work. The chapel of Saint Francis was frescoed by Lo Spagna, on of Perugino's pupils.
*S.&nbsp;Martino, with Lombard lapidary remains and good paintings by Mezzastris. 
*S.&nbsp;Francesco, a large Gothic building, now housing a museum.

The territory of the ''comune'' is particularly rich in Romanesque churches: some of those in the plain, erected on the Roman Via Flaminia when that road was in use, and incorporating a fair amount of Roman spolia, remain as markers of the road's course.

==Museums==

Trevi's main museum is the Museo S.&nbsp;Francesco, attached to the Gothic church of that name, now secularized; it contains some slight Roman lapidary material, but a more important collection of Umbrian painting from the late Middle Ages through the 17th&nbsp;century: the main work is the ''Coronation of the Virgin'' altarpiece by Lo&nbsp;Spagna, originally in San Martino. Particularly notable are a group of ex-votos representative of 16th‑ through 18th‑century folk art.

The Museo della Civiltà dell'&nbsp;Olivo provides an educational look at the olive industry, from the planting of the olive through its processing into oil; the Flash Art Museum houses contemporary art exhibits.

==Economy==

The mainstays of Trevi's economy are olive oil and tourism.
