'''Tiverton Town Football Club''' (commonly known as '''Tiverton Town''' or simply '''Tiverton''') are an English non-league football club from Tiverton, Devon that plays in the Southern Football League. Managed by Martyn Rogers, the club is nicknamed "The Yellows" due to their all-yellow strip, or "Tivvy", simply because it is a short version of their club name. The club plays its home matches at Ladysmead, Bolham Road, Tiverton.

As '''Tiverton Athletic''', the club played it's home games at the Athletic Ground, now known as Amory Park. The ground boasted a huge wooden pavilion with a seated verandah, which was quite extravagant for a non-league club in the 1910s.

In 1921, Athletic were effectively evicted from their ground and moved to a local rugby pitch, Elm Field (aka "The Elms"), with the reformed rugby club taking their place at their old ground. A satisfactory ground, The Elms housed a wooden 150-seat stand on one side, with grass banks behind the goals being the only other spectator zones.

The Elms was pretty much destroyed during World War II, meaning Tivvy now had to move to a third ground. They found a place they could call home in a small stadium called Ladysmead, where they still currently play their home games. Despite having a lovely new stadium with an extra stand built out of compensation money, The Yellows had no changing rooms and had to change in the nearby Cross Keys pub, a 10-minute walk from the ground.

Since moving into Ladysmead, the seated capacity has been increased to 520 with the installation of more seats in 2002, and the total capacity has been increased to 3500 with covered terraced areas being built at the main road and west ends.

Tiverton's record attendance came in the Leyton Orient on November 12, 1994<ref></ref>.
