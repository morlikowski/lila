The land of other Burgundian kingdom, but it remained ruled by its own powerful, and largely independent, counts. 

In the eleventh century, Provence became disputed between the traditional line and the Frankish origin, to the House of Anjou and to a cadet branch of the House of Valois.  After Charles VIII in 1484. 

==Merovingian dukes and patricians==
During the period of the duces'' (dukes), military leaders and district commanders who served as defenders of the frontiers of the kingdom and ruled over vast territories as opposed to the ''comites'' (counts), who ruled the cities and their environs. Provence was usually a part of the division of the Frankish realm known as Burgundy, which was treated as its own kingdom. Their title sometimes appears as ''rector Provinciae''.

==Carolingian kings==
After the division of the middle kingdom in accordance with the custom of the Franks between his three sons. Out of this division came the Charles. A heritage of royal rule was thus inaugurated in Provence that, though it was often subsumed into one of its larger neighbouring kingdoms, it was just as often proclaiming its own sovereigns. 

The kingdom of Provence was also known as Lower Burgundy (or Cisjurane Burgundy). Its capital was first Vienne then Arles and it is therefore sometimes known as Arelate. 

*Charles (855 &ndash; 863)
:''Provence divided between surviving brothers, Lothair II and the Emperor Louis II. The bulk goes to Louis.''
*Louis II (863 &ndash; 875), also Holy Roman Emperor from 855
:''As with his Kingdom of Italy, Louis's Provence goes to his uncle on his death.''
*Charles the Bald (875 &ndash; 877), also Holy Roman Emperor from 875
*Louis the Stammerer (877 &ndash; 879)
:''With the death of Louis, Charles' successor, Provence refused to elect his two sons and instead elected one of their own as king. Boso married Ermengard, daughter of Louis II, to strengthen his and his son's claim.''
*Boso (879 &ndash; 887)
*Louis the Blind (887 &ndash; 928), also Holy Roman Emperor from 901 to 905
:''Louis's kingdom did not pass to his heirs, but instead to his brother-in-law, the husband of his sister, Hugh, who had acted as his regent since 905. Hugh never used the royal title in Provence.''
*Hugh (911 &ndash; 933)
:''In 933, Provence ceases to be a separate kingdom as Hugh exchanged it with Rudolph II of Upper Burgundy for the Iron Crown of Lombardy, that is, rule of Italy.''

==Counts, within the Empire==
It was in the aftermath of the death of Louis the Blind that Provence began to be ruled by local counts placed under the authority of a margrave. Firstly, Hugh of Arles served as duke and regent during Louis' long blindness. Secondly, Hugh gave the march of Vienne and duchy of Provence to Rudolf II of Burgundy in a treaty of 933. Rudolf was never recognised by the nobles of the country and instead appointed Hugh, Duke of Burgundy, its first margrave. 

At the time, the premier counts in the region were the those of Avignon. From William I and Rotbold II did not divide their father's domains and this indivisibility was maintained by their respective descendants. It is thus impossible to ascertain who succeeded whom in the county as various reigns overlap. The margravial title also continued in their family until it passed to the Bertrand of Toulouse in 1062.
