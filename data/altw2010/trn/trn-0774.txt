'''Phil Taylor''', better known as '''"Philthy Animal" Taylor''', was the British band, fans consists of Fast Eddie Clarke.

== Biography ==
Born on Motörhead''. Lemmy explains choosing him to play in Motörhead 'because he had a car and could give a lift back down to the studio, the drummer they had wasn't working out very well and Phil kept saying that he could play'. Taylor introduced the band to "Fast" Eddie Clarke, having worked with him while painting a houseboat. Taylor was unable to overdub the drumming on the 'Lost Johnny' track as he was arrested for being drunk and disorderly, and the studio time had run out by the time he was released.

In Ace of Spades'' album, Taylor broke his neck after being lifted above the head of a friend in a test of strength, only to be dropped upon his head. Taylor continued to play in Motörhead with the aid of a neck brace, as is visible in the music video for "Ace of Spades". As a result, Taylor now has a prominent lump located on the back of his neck (affectionately referred to as his "knob"), thought to be a calcium deposit caused by his previous spinal trauma. Tour-disrupting injuries were not unfamiliar to Taylor at the time, as he had previously broken his hand whilst punching a man outside of his flat in London. In typical uncompromising Motörhead style,  Taylor continued to drum by duct-taping his drum stick into his hand until it had sufficiently healed.
 
After a 'final' appearance on ''The Young Ones'' in Operator.

Taylor returned to Motörhead in Kilmister, Ian and Garza, Janiss ''White Line Fever'' (2002) — Simon & Schuster pp. 242-243 ISBN 0-684-85868-1</ref>

More recently, he played in a band called The Web Of Spider.

In 2007 Taylor was back with a new band called Capricorn, along with former Danzig guitarist Todd Youth, former Monster Magnet guitarist/vocalist Phil Caivano and former Nashville Pussy bassist Corey Parks.

<!-- == Death ==

'''Phil Taylor''' (* Chesterfield) ist ein englischer Schlagzeuger und ehemaliges Mitglied der Band Motörhead. 

Er gilt zusammen mit Eddie Clarke und Lemmy Kilmister als Mitglied der ersten Stunde und der sogenannten klassischen Besetzung.  Er stieg um 1976 bei der Band ein und war mit kurzer Unterbrechung bis 1992 der etatmäßige Drummer der Band. Sein Spitzname lautet „Philthy Animal“.

Taylor zählte nicht zu den technisch brillanten Schlagzeugern, sondern überzeugte durch seine Energie und Geschwindigkeit, die für damalige Verhältnisse ungewöhnlich war. Somit passte er perfekt zu Motörhead, die auch nicht technisch hochwertig, sondern „dreckig“, schnell und laut spielten. 

1984 verließ er die Band um drei Jahre später wieder beizutreten. Neben auffälligen technischen Fehlern (z.B. Eat the Rich) fehlte ihm jedoch mehr und mehr die Kondition um lange, schnelle Lieder wie ''Overkill'' am Ende eines Sets live zu spielen. Dies führte auch dazu, dass er Anfang 1992 aus der Band geworfen und durch Mikkey Dee ersetzt wurde.
