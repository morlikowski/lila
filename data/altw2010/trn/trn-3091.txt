'''Constantin Zureiq''' () (born Damascus 1909-2000), a prominent Arab intellectual and academic, was one of the pioneering theorists of modern Arab nationalism. He developed some ideas, such as the "Arab mission" and "national philosophy", which were to become key concepts for Arab nationalist thinkers, and in more recent years was a strong proponent of an intellectual reformation of Arab society, emphasising the need for rationalism and an ethical revolution.

==Life and academic career==
Constantin Zureiq was born in Greek Orthodox family, and received his primary education in the Orthodox school system and attended secondary school at International College, in Beirut. He subsequently studied at the American University of Beirut before completing his studies at Princeton University in the United States, where he received a doctorate in history in 1930.

After receiving his doctorate Zureiq worked as a university lecturer and as a diplomat, before being appointed president of University of Damascus in 1949. In 1952 he was appointed vice-president of the American University of Beirut, and from 1954 to 1958 was its acting president.<ref>These details regarding Zureiq's life are as given in Charif, pp. 240-241n. </ref>

==Contribution to the theoretical development of Arab nationalism==
Zureiq's first notable publication, based on a lecture he gave in 1938, was entitled ''The Arab consciousness'' ''(al-wa`i al-`arabi)''. In this book, published in 1939, he introduced the concept of the "Arab mission": the aim of each nation, he stated, was "the message it brings to human culture and general civilisation", and a nation without a mission was not worthy of the name. The consciousness of having a "national mission" would bring the Arab struggle for independence new strength and meaning and would regain for the Arabs their world role.<ref>Charif, p. 209. </ref> As for the Arab mission itself, in the current age it would be 
<blockquote>to absorb the knowledge of the West and to join it with the views that have arisen in reaction to it, and to combine them in a new unity that will be a sign of the coming life, and that the Arabs will spread to the world as they spread their brilliant civilisation in the past ages.<ref>Quoted by Charif, pp. 209-210.</ref></blockquote>
It was also in this work that Zureiq called for a "national philosophy", which he expressed as the thought absorbed by the youth of the nation combined with their feelings to form a "nationalist creed". Such a philosophy, he declared, was necessary for national renewal.<ref>Charif, p. 210.</ref>

Both these concepts were to become prominent in the nationalist ideology developed by other Arab writers, and indeed the idea of an Arab mission would be taken up, in a different form, by Michel Aflaq and become the slogan of the Ba'th Party in later years. Zureiq was also a major intellectual influence on the Arab Nationalist Movement.
