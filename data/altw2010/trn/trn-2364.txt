'''Cormac McCarthy''' (* US-amerikanischer Roman-Autor.

Kennzeichnend für seinen sehr drastischen Stil, in dem er die schicksalshaften Verstrickungen seiner Helden am Rande der US-amerikanischen Gesellschaft schildert, ist sein naturalistischer Verismus. Neben anschaulichen Naturbeschreibungen findet man Dialoge, die der Realität entnommen scheinen, aber auch Beschreibungen, die Vorgänge mystifizieren.

Für seine Bücher wurde er unter anderem mit dem „Die Straße“) mit dem Pulitzer-Preis ausgezeichnet.

McCarthy wuchs in Knoxville, El Paso, Santa Fe, New Mexico.

McCarthy's first novel, ''William Faulkner's editor until Faulkner's death in 1962. Erskine continued to edit McCarthy for the next twenty years.

In the summer of 1965, using a Traveling Fellowship award from The American Academy of Arts and Letters, McCarthy shipped out aboard the liner ''Sylvania'', hoping to visit Ireland. While on the ship, he met Anne DeLisle, who was working on the ship as a singer. In 1966, they were married in England. Also in 1966, McCarthy received a Rockefeller Foundation Grant, which he used to travel around Southern Europe before landing in Ibiza, where he wrote his second novel ''Outer Dark''. Afterward he returned to America with his wife, and ''Outer Dark'' was published in 1968 to generally favorable reviews.<ref name="persp"/>

In 1969, McCarthy and his wife moved to Louisville, Tennessee, and purchased a barn, which McCarthy renovated, even doing the stonework himself.<ref name="persp"/> Here he wrote his next book ''Child of God'', based on actual events. ''Child of God'' was published in 1973. Like ''Outer Dark'' before it, ''Child of God'' was set in southern Appalachia. In 1976, McCarthy separated from Anne DeLisle and moved to El Paso, Texas. In 1979, his novel ''Suttree'' was finally published. He had been writing ''Suttree'' on and off for twenty years.<ref name="nytint"/> 

Supporting himself with the money from his 1981 MacArthur Fellowship, he wrote his next novel ''Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West'', which was published in 1985. The book has grown appreciably in stature in literary circles. In a 2006 poll of authors and publishers conducted by The New York Times Magazine to list the greatest novels of the previous quarter-century, Beloved and Don DeLillo's Underworld.

In a 2005 review of ''No Country for Old Men'', The New Yorker magazine, despite admitting McCarthy a "colossally gifted writer", dismissed the novel as "an unimportant, stripped-down thriller". However, it was praised by other critics, and its cinematic version, adapted by the Coen Brothers, won four Academy Awards and more than 75 film awards globally.

McCarthy now lives in the Santa Fe, with his wife, Jennifer Winkley, and their son, John. He guards his privacy. In one of his few interviews (with ''The New York Times''), McCarthy is described as a "gregarious loner" and reveals that he is not a fan of authors that do not "deal with issues of life and death," citing Henry James and Marcel Proust as examples. "I don't understand them," he said. "To me, that's not literature. A lot of writers who are considered good I consider strange."<ref name="nytint"/>. McCarthy remains active in the academic community of Santa Fe and spends much of his time at the Santa Fe Institute, which was founded by his friend, physicist Murray Gell-Mann.
