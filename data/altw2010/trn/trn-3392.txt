The series primarily deals with Kasumi Asakura, a.k.a. Rose Hip. An amnesiac teenage high school girl, she blends in with the local high school population while fighting off criminals and terrorists with her amazing skills in both martial arts and firearms.

==Plot==

The manga tells the story of a high school kid named Shouhei Aiba, who mysteriously bumped into a nerdy high school female named Kasumi Asakura. At first, Shouhei thinks that Kasumi was being strange for her acrobatic skills and her ability to tell different people from the crowd. 

Later on, Shouhei discovers that Kasumi is actually an anti-terrorist specialist named Rose Hip. Rose Hip, lately, was ordered to engage a right-wing terrorist group lead by a man whose codename is Goat. The two soon get wind of his plot to overthrow the elected Japanese government by taking hostages at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building and destroy it with explosives.
