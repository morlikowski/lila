The '''Yakovlev Yak-11''' (Russian: '''Як-11''') was a 1947 until 1962.

==History==
The Yak-11 design was based in large part on the successful Yak-3 fighter; it became the Soviet Air Force's most widely used trainer aircraft and has sometimes been equated in importance with the 1945; the aircraft entered service in 1946. In total, 3,859 aircraft were produced between 1947 and 1956. From 1953, an additional 707 were licence-built by Let in Czechoslovakia under the name '''LET C-11'''. Both Yak-11 and C-11 were used in all Warsaw Pact countries, as well as many African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries, such as Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Bulgaria, China, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Hungary, Poland, North Korea, Romania, Somalia, Soviet Union, Syria, Vietnam, Yemen and Austria. 

In 1958, the Yak-11 was to be replaced by the tricycle-geared '''Yak-11U''' which was intended as a trainer for jet pilots. However, the U variant was only produced in small numbers, and the Yak-11 remained in service with the VVS until 1962.

Due to its Yak-3 lineage, the Yak-11 has recently seen widespread popularity among Souped-up versions of the Yak-11 can be frequently seen at air races. About 120 Yak-11s remain in airworthy condition.
