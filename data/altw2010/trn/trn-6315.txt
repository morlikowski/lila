'''Wilfred''' or '''Wifred''', called '''the Hairy''',<ref>'''Guifré el Pilós''' in Catalan; '''Vifredo el Velloso''', also Wilfredo, Wifredo, Guifredo, or Guilfredo in Spanish</ref> was Cerdanya (870&ndash;897), Barcelona (878&ndash;897), Girona (878&ndash;897), Besalú (878&ndash;897), and Ausona (886&ndash;897). 

He was responsible for the repopulation of the long depopulated no-man's land around Christian and Muslim), the re-establishment of the bishopric of Vic, and the foundation of the Monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll, where he is buried. 

==Historical significance==
Wilfred the Hairy was the Wifred Borell, inherited the county without any interruption and held it between 898&ndash;914.

A number of primitive feudal entities developed in the ''Marca Hispanica'', during the 9th century.  They were generally self-sufficient and agrarian, but ruled by a small military elite. The pattern seen in Catalonia is similar to that found in similar border lands or marches elsewhere in Europe.

Traditionally the count of Barcelona was appointed directly by the Carolingian emperor, for example the appointment of Berà (in 801).  The appointment of heirs could not be taken for granted.  However, with the rise of strong Counts such as Sunifred, (fl. 844- 848) and Wilfred, and the weakening of Carolingian, then French royal power, eventually the appointment of heirs become a formality.  This trend resulted in the counts becoming ''de facto'' independent of the Carolingian Crown under Borrell II in 985). 

Wilfred remained obscure until drawn into the historians' net by Sir Richard Southern, in ''The Making of the Middle Ages'', 1953.

==Origins==
Wilfred was of Gothic lineage from the region of Prades in the County of Conflent, now Rià, in Roussillon, France. 

According to legend, he was the son of Wilfred of Arriaount (or Wilfred of Arri), a county near Prades.  His father was murdered by Salomón and Wilfred became his avenger, killing the assassin.  However Ramón de Abadal's study claimed him to be the son of count of Empúries and Bellonid dynasty.

In the dynastic struggles that accompanied the three years between Toulouse) Bernard of Septimania, aligned with Pepin II of Aquitaine, while the Bellonids maintained their allegiance to Charles the Bald.  In 844, after taking Toulouse and capturing Bernard, Charles had him executed.  In exchange for his fealty, Charles gave the dead count's honours of Barcelona, Girona, Narbonne, Nîmes, Agde, Béziers, and Melgueil to Sunifred.  

In 848, William, son of Bernard, was named count of Toulouse and Empúries by Pepin II.  He quickly moved to eliminate Sunifred and Sunyer.

==Investiture==
The Bellonid dynasty was revived slightly by the appointment of Miró (known as ''the Old''), counts respectively of Urgell and Cerdanya, and Conflent in June, 870 at an assembly at Attigny.  For in that year, the mysteriously ill-chronicled Salomon, count of Urgell, Cerdanya, and Conflent, had died. 

After becoming Count of Urgell and Cerdanya in 870, Wilfred received the counties of king of France, Louis the Stammerer.  His reign coincided with the crumbling of Carolingian authority and unity.  He was thus the last count of the Hispanic March appointed by the French king and the first to pass his vast holdings as an inheritance to his sons (albeit sanctioned by the monarch).  

Wilfred came into possession of Barcelona through his service to Bernard of Gothia, Count of Barcelona, Rousillon, and numerous other Septimanian counties.  Wilfred, Miró, their brother Sunifred (who became the Abbot of Sigebuto, Bishop of Narbonne, and expelled all partisan priests from the church.  

At the Radulph (878-920).

==Intervention in Ausona==
After the investiture of 878, Wilfred's lands stretched from the Bergueda, Lluçanès, the Plana de Vic, Moianès, Guilleries, and Bages—had long been depopulated; since the rebellion of Aissó.  

Wilfred embarked on the process of repopulating these territories with immigrants from the heavily populated mountain regions—Ausona from the  remaining Counties made up of Ripollés, Lluçanès, the Plana de Vic, and Guilleries—centred aroung Ausona (the city), had a unique ethnic and cultural history whose population descended from an ancient historic Hispanic tribe.  He also added Moianés and Bagés and the lands around Manresa, which were distinct in their history themselves. In 885, Wilfred designated a Viscount to control the County of Ausona in his absence as it formed the frontier with the Moslem Kingdoms to the south.

==Ecclesiastical reform==
The ecclesiastic state of the region was no less isolated than its political state, the parishes largely remaining outside of the universal hierarchy.  Wilfred brought the parishes of Bergueda and Vall de Lord within the control of the nearby diocese of Urgell.  However, he had to re-establish the lapsed bishopric in Ausona.  After consulting the Archbishop of Narbonne in 886, he was given permission to install Gotmar, a priest, as bishop of Ausona.  The new bishop immediately set about restoring the repopulated city and its cathedral which had beem devastated and in ruins since the last Muslim conquest and the rebellion of Aissó.

The churches in the region during this period flourished gaining much power and privilege.  This included the right for monks to elect their own Abbots as espoused by Saint Benedict.  Wilfred founded two new monasteries: Santa María de Ripoll (880) and Emma, who became the community's first abbess in 899 and was given immunity from lay jurisdiction by King Charles the Simple.

==Carolingian Crisis==
When Louis the Stammerer died (879), the kingdom was divided between his two young sons: Louis III received the ancient northern partitions of the Merovingian kingdom, Lorraine).  His other son Carloman received the southern partitions, Channel and Atlantic coasts.

At the Assembly of Germany and Italy.  Charles, son of illustrious great-grandfather.  He would also be the last. 

Incapable of much, he was lethargic and probably suffered from Paris.  Instead, however, he chose to buy the Vikings off, paying them to attack Burgundy (not a friend of his) instead.  He left Paris in December.  He subsequently failed to deal with revolts in Swabia, Saxony, Thuringia, Franconia, and Bavaria.  The nobles of the Empire deposed him in 887.  He died two months later (888).
