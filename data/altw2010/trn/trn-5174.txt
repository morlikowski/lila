:''"Planning the attacks was a master deed, in technical and organizational terms. To hijack four big airliners within a few minutes and fly them into targets within a single hour and doing so on complicated flight routes! That is unthinkable, without backing from the secret apparatuses of state and industry." Tagesspiegel, 13. Jan. 2002 [http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/VonBuelow.html]

He told The Daily Telegraph at his home in Bonn.

He has expressed his views on the September 11, 2001 attacks in various media, including Germany's Alex Jones's talk radio program.
