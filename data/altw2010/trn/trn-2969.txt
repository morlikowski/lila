Die '''Carbonari''' (italienisch für ''italienischen Staaten des 19. Jahrhunderts beteiligten Geheimbünde. Sie entwickelten als Charbonnerie auch in Frankreich politischen Einfluss.

== Eigenart des Bundes ==
Die Carbonari erinnern trotz ihrer katholisch-mystischen Inhalte in ihrer Form stark an die Freimaurer von den Steinmetzgilden, so nahmen die Carbonari ihre Gebräuche und Benennungen von den Köhlern. 

Die Aufnahme gestaltete sich stufenweise: es gab Lehrlings-, Gesellen- und Meisterabteilungen, die höchsten Grade erlangten nur wenige Mitglieder. Doch waren alle zur absoluten Verschwiegenheit und zum unbedingten Gehorsam gegen die Oberen vereidigt. 

Die Mitglieder nannten sich gegenseitig ''buoni cugini'' (gute Vetter), Nichtzugehörige hießen ''pagani'' (Heiden). Ihre Versammlungsgebäude nannten sie ''baracca'' (Hütte) und die Zusammenkünfte selbst ''vendita'' (Markt oder Loge). Die Vereinigungen der Frauen ("Gärtnerinnen") hießen "Gärten", der Platz außerhalb der ''vendita'' war der "Wald", in dem die "Wölfe" (gemeint waren die italienischen Fürsten) hausten. 

Zwischen 1815 und 1820 sollen dem Geheimbund mehr als 600.000 Menschen angehört haben.

Die Losung der Carbonari lautete '''''I'''ustum '''n'''ecare '''r'''eges '''I'''taliae'' (''Es ist gerecht Italiens Könige zu töten''), deren Abkürzung INRI mit den Initialen am Kreuz Jesu übereinstimmte und so über das Erkennungszeichen täuschen sollte.

== Entstehung ==
Der historische Ursprung der Carbonari ist unklar; der Geheimbund entwickelte sich in der napoleonischen Zeit in der Gegend um Ferdinand I. stellten. 

The '''Carbonari''' ("charcoal burners"<ref name="chburners">"CARBONARI (an Italian word meaning charcoal-burners)" from the [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/CAL_CAR/CARBONARI_an_Italian_word_meani.html Carbonari article] in the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica</ref>) were groups of secret revolutionary societies founded in early 19th-century Italy. Their goals were patriotic and liberal and they played an important role in the Risorgimento and the early years of Italian nationalism. 

==Organization==
They were organized in the fashion of cells scattered across Italy. They sought the creation of a liberal, unified Italy.

The membership was separated into two classes—apprentice and master.  There were two ways to become a master, through serving as an apprentice for at least six months<ref name="appsix">"apprentice could rise to the grade of a master before the end of six months." From [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03330c.htm Carbonari] in the Catholic Encyclopedia</ref> or by being a Freemason on entry.<ref name="masoninst">"Freemasons could enter the Carbonari as masters at once." From [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03330c.htm Carbonari] in the Catholic Encyclopedia</ref> Their initiation rituals were structured around the trade of charcoal-selling, hence their name.

==History==
Although it is not clear where they were originally established<ref name="origin">"It is not certain whether the Carbonari, as a political society, had its first organization in France or Italy." From the [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03330c.htm Carbonari] article in the Catholic Encyclopedia</ref>, they first came to prominence in the Kingdom of Naples during the Napoleonic wars.<ref name="import">"The Carbonari were probably an offshoot of the Freemasons, from whom they differed in important particulars, and first began to assume importance in southern Italy during the Napoleonic wars." From the [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/CAL_CAR/CARBONARI_an_Italian_word_meani.html CARBONARI] article in the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica</ref>  

They began by resisting the French occupiers, notably Joachim Murat, the Bonapartist King of Naples. However once the wars ended, they became a nationalist organisation with a marked anti-Austrian tendency and were instrumental in organising revolution in Italy in 1820–1821 and 1831. The 1820 revolution began in Naples against King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, who was forced to make concessions and promise a constitutional monarchy. This success inspired Carbonari in the north of Italy to revolt too. In 1821, the Kingdom of Sardinia obtained a constitutional monarchy as a result of Carbonari actions. However, the Holy Alliance would not tolerate this state of affairs and in February, 1821, sent an army to crush the revolution in Naples. The King of Sardinia also called for Austrian intervention. Faced with an enemy overwhelmingly superior in number, the Carbonari revolts collapsed and their leaders fled into exile. In 1830, Carbonari took part in the July Revolution in France. This gave them hope that a successful revolution might be staged in Italy. A bid in Modena was an outright failure, but in February 1831, several cities in the Papal States rose up and flew the Carbonari tricolour. A volunteer force marched on Rome but was destroyed by Austrian troops who had intervened at the request of Pope Gregory XVI After the failed uprisings of 1831, the governments of the Italian states cracked down on the Carbonari, who now virtually ceased to exist. The more astute members realised they could never take on the Austrian army in open battle and joined a new movement, Giovane Italia ("Young Italy") led by Mazzini.

==Relations with the Church==
The Carbonari were anti-clerical in both their philosophy and program.  The Papal constitution Ecclesiam a Jesu Christo and the encyclical Qui Pluribus were directed against them.  The controversial document, the Alta Vendita, which called for a modernist takeover of the Catholic Church, was attributed to the Sicilian Carbonari.

==Prominent Carbonari==
Prominent members of the Carbonari included:
*Silvio Pellico (1788–1854) and Pietro Maroncelli (1795–1846) 
:both were imprisoned by the Austrians for years, many of which they spent in Spielberg fortress in Brno, Southern Moravia. After his release, Pellico wrote a book ''Le mie prigioni'', describing in detail his ten-year ordeal. Maroncelli lost one leg in prison and was instrumental in translating and editing of Pellico's book in Paris (1833).  
*Giuseppe Mazzini, 
*Marquis de Lafayette (hero of the American and French Revolutions),  
*Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (the future French emperor Napoleon III) 
*French revolutionary Blanqui.
