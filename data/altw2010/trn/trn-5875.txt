In legendarium, '''Faramir''' is a Fellowship of the Ring and second son of Denethor II, the Steward of the realm of Gondor. The relationships between the three men are revealed over the course of the book and are elaborated in the appendices.

Faramir first enters the narrative in person in ''Ruling Ring. In ''adaptations of ''The Lord of the Rings'', most notably in film trilogy, which introduces significant changes in Faramir's character.

In ''The History of The Lord of the Rings'' series Christopher Tolkien described that his father had not foreseen the emergence of Faramir during the writing of the book, only inventing him at the actual point of his appearance in ''The Two Towers''.<ref></ref> J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Tolkien noted that the introduction of Faramir had led to postponement of the book's dénouement and to further development of the background for Gondor and Rohan.<ref name="Letter66"></ref> Long after completing ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien would write that of all characters Faramir resembles the author most, and that he had deliberately bestowed upon the character several traits of his own.<ref name="Letter180"></ref>

==Literature==
===Background===
Early years of Faramir's life are described in the main narrative of ''The Lord of the Rings'' only passingly, with more detail revealed in the appendices. It is stated that Faramir was born in the year 2983 of the Stewardship of Gondor, ascending a year after Faramir's birth.<ref name="AppB"/> Denethor had married Finduilas, daughter of Prince Adrahil of Dol Amroth;<ref name="AppA"></ref> however, she died untimely when Faramir was five, and is said to have remained to him "but a memory of loveliness in far days and of his first grief".<ref name="RK-SK"></ref>

After her death Denethor became sombre, cold, and detached from his family, but the relationship between Faramir and wizard Gandalf who occasionally visited Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor. Being eager for knowledge, Faramir learned much from Gandalf about the history of the realm and about the death of Isildur.<ref name="AppA"/><ref name="TT-WW"></ref>

Gondor had long been threatened by the nearby realm of Mordor, and in 3018 the Dark Lord Sauron began the War of the Ring, attacking the ruined city of Osgiliath that guarded the passage to Minas Tirith.<ref name="AppB"/> Faramir and Boromir commanded the defence, and were among those few who survived when the eastern half of Osgiliath was captured and the bridges across the River Anduin were destroyed.<ref name="FR-CE"></ref>

In ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' it is recounted that shortly before the battle Faramir had a prophetic dream, which later often recurred to him and once to Boromir. In this dream a voice spoke about a council that was to be held at Imladris far to the north, about the awakening of "Isildur's Bane", approaching of "Doom", and appearance of "the Halfling". Faramir decided to journey to Imladris and seek advice of Elrond the Half-elven, but Boromir claimed the errand for himself, fearing for his brother, and was approved by Denethor and a council of the elders; Faramir remained to defend Gondor.<ref name="FR-CE"/><ref name="TT-WW"/>

====''The Two Towers''====
thumb|right|230px|[[Anke Katrin Eißmann|Anke Eißmann's portrayal of Faramir interrogating Frodo.]]Faramir first encountered the Hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in Ithilien and recognized them to be the Halflings mentioned in his dreams. Faramir questioned Frodo of his quest, and Frodo revealed that he, along with eight other companions, had set out from Rivendell. During the interrogation, Faramir asked often about Boromir. 

One night, while on guard, Faramir waded down to the Orcs.

Faramir also asked about the One Ring, but Frodo tried to avoid the subject. Faramir determined that Frodo was carrying one of Sauron's great weapons. At this point, he showed the crucial difference between him and his proud brother:

In the Rangers’ secret refuge behind the waterfall, Henneth Annûn, Sam accidentally spoke of Boromir’s desire for the One Ring, thus revealing the item Frodo was carrying. Despite the Hobbits’ fears, Faramir was wise enough to realize that such a weapon was not to be used and if desired, should be resisted. With this knowledge, he also realized what his brother had to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself — knowing that Boromir would not have been able to resist the temptation to seize the Ring for himself. Giving them provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol.

====''The Return of the King''====
The following evening in Cair Andros, Faramir sent his company south to reinforce the garrison at Osgiliath, while he and three of his men rode to Minas Tirith. Along the way, they were pursued by Sauron's servants, the Nazgûl. Faramir rode back to help the fallen. Immediately, Gandalf rode out to their aid, temporarily banishing the Nazgûl.

Faramir arrived at Minas Tirith and reported to Denethor and Gandalf of his encounter with Frodo and Sam. Denethor became angry that Faramir had not brought the Ring to Gondor, wishing that he and his brother’s places had been reversed — since Denethor believed that Boromir would have brought Sauron's weapon to him. Denethor sent Faramir to hold Osgiliath against Sauron's armies, which greatly outnumbered their own. Although Faramir disagreed with his father’s strategy, he agreed to go.

Sauron's second-in-command, the Witch-king of Angmar, led a much larger force from Minas Morgul, and attacked Osgiliath. After Osgiliath was conquered, Faramir decided to stay with the rearguard in order to make sure that the retreat over Pelennor would not turn into a rout. He was gravely wounded by a Southron arrow and the Black Breath of the Nazgûl. Fortunately, all of the mounted soldiers in the city rode to his aid and brought him back to Denethor in Minas Tirith.

When Faramir returned unconscious, Denethor believed him to be fatally injured. That blow, coupled with a vision in the prophetic ''palantír'' of the forces arrayed against him, caused him to lose his mind. He ordered his servants to build a funeral pyre in the House of Stewards for him and his son. Denethor's temporary Hobbit servant, Peregrin Took, went to alert Gandalf and Beregond, one of the Tower Guards he had befriended. Gandalf and Beregond stopped the impending sacrifice just in time. Mad with grief, Denethor jumped onto the lit pyre, burning himself alive.

Two days later, the battle over, Aragorn came and revived Faramir with ''athelas'' in the Houses of Healing. During his subsequent recuperation there, Faramir met the Lady Éowyn of Rohan; moved by her sorrow, pride, and beauty, he eventually fell in love with her. At first, Éowyn refused his advances, only desiring to go to war to find honour in death. But soon Éowyn realized that she had come to love him in return.

Faramir briefly served as a Ruling Steward, and began preparing the city for the arrival of Aragorn, who was now King of Gondor. On the day of the King’s official coronation, Faramir surrendered his office. Aragorn, however, announced that as long as his line would last, Faramir and his descendants would be Stewards of Gondor.

In addition, Aragorn appointed Faramir as the Prince of Ithilien and Beregond to be the Captain of his guard, the White Company.  As Prince of Ithilien, he and the Prince of Dol Amroth became King Elessar's chief commanders. In a draft to a reader of ''The Lord of the Rings'', J. R. R. Tolkien writes that as Prince of Ithilien, Faramir's duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and Orcs and cleansing Minas Morgul of evil remnants.<ref></ref> Faramir also fulfilled the traditional role as Steward, acting as the King’s chief counsellor and ruling Gondor in his absence.

With Éowyn, he settled in Thain's Book'' by the writer Findegil,<ref></ref> and appears in ''The Lord of the Rings'' as part of Appendix A. Barahir may have been the son of Elboron, but nothing directly indicates this conclusion.

===Characteristics===
Faramir's personality is prominently described in the appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings'':

Tolkien recorded that Faramir greatly resembled Boromir in appearance,<ref name="RK-SG"></ref><ref name="AppA"/> who in his turn is described as "a tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance".<ref name="FR-CE"/> Members of the line of the Stewards were wont to be of a nobler appearance and bearing than most of the inhabitants of Gondor;<ref name="AppA"/> in case of Faramir, it is stated that "by some chance the blood of Westernesse [ran] nearly true" in him, which was rare.<ref name="RK-MT"></ref> This trait was elaborated by Tolkien through the speech of Pippin:
