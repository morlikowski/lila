==爭議==
===交通肇事逃逸事件===
2003年5月14日，卡弗蒂驾驶其轿车在纽约曼哈顿第九大道撞倒一位骑自行车的人后逃离肇事现场。根据警方的表示，卡弗蒂在逃逸的时候至少闯了两次红灯。事后卡弗蒂表示认罪并被判罚款250美元以及70小时的社区劳动。
===中國言論爭議===
卡弗蒂在The Situation Room》發表了一番針對中國的言論：「我们和他们积累数以千亿元的贸易逆差，因为我们不断输入他们含铅的垃圾产品和有毒宠物食品，又将工作转移到你可以给工人一美元月薪的地方。这样就可以制造我们在沃尔玛买到的东西。所以我認為我們和中國的關係大有改變，50年以來，他们都是同一批暴民和惡棍<ref>原文為：Well, I don't know if China is any different, but our relationship with China is certainly different. We're in hock to the Chinese up to our eyeballs because of the war in Iraq, for one thing. They're holding hundreds of billions of dollars worth of our paper. We also are running hundred of billions of dollars worth of trade deficits with them, as we continue to import their junk with the lead paint on them and the poisoned pet food, and export, you know, jobs to places where you can pay workers a dollar a month to turn out the stuff that we're buying from Wal-Mart. So I think our relationship with China has certainly changed. I think they're basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they've been for the last 50 years</ref>。（这句话被部分媒体翻译为“

'''Jack Cafferty''' (born Chicago, Illinois) is a CNN commentator and occasional host of specials.  In the summer of 2005, Cafferty joined ''The Situation Room''.

==Controversial remarks==
Cafferty's outspoken and provocative style of commentary has on occasion led to public outcry. Though he acknowledges his habit of "saying some pretty outrageous stuff," Cafferty has characterised this as part of his job description: "I get paid to ask questions I don't know the answers to and to complain about the things that bother me."<ref name="Cafferty's book"></ref>

===Bush Administration===
Cafferty initially supported the U.S. government's invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003. He says he "bought the whole song and dance about WMDs. I was caught up in the national hysteria that followed 9/11, and was captive to the political manipulation, if you will, that took place in all of us." He revised his position when the Downing Street memo was leaked in 2005 and has since become a harsh critic of the administration.

On the Iraq War, Cafferty stated: "In my humble opinion, the Bush administration used 9/11 as an excuse to start the war in Iraq. People make a lot of money during wartime &mdash; $600 billion we've spent there so far &mdash; and a lot of that money has gone to friends of the administration, and of course there is all that oil. I don't think for a single second there was anything honorable about the decision to invade a sovereign country. They had nothing to do with 9/11 and had done nothing to the United States. But hey... what do I know?"<ref name="democrats">  </ref>

On hunting accident, Cafferty caused a stir by remarking, "I would guess it didn't exactly represent a profile in courage for the vice-president to wander over there to the F-word network for a sitdown with Brit Hume. I mean, that's a little like Bonnie interviewing Clyde, ain't it?"<ref name="caustic commentator"></ref> As this is a common euphemism used at CNN to refer to He Who Shall Not Be Named), Cafferty later clarified: "Get your mind out of the gutter. The F-word is Fox."<ref name="caustic commentator"/> A Fox spokesperson retorted: "Jack is about as unstable as CNN's programming lineup; nobody pays much attention to his incoherent ramblings."<ref name="caustic commentator"/> 

Cafferty was reprimanded by the president of CNN when he called Donald Rumsfeld "an obnoxious jerk and war criminal" on the eve of the 2006 midterm election.<ref name="time interview"/> He made an on-air acknowledgment of having "stepped over the line"; however, he later told an interviewer: "I will go to my grave as Jack Cafferty, private citizen, believing that these people committed war crimes."<ref name="time interview"/>

===The U.S. Democratic Party===
His cynicism is not reserved for the Republican Party. Cafferty once stated that "It seems the Democrats are the greatest thing the Republicans have going for them sometimes."<ref name="democrats">  </ref> When House Speaker House of Representatives by a simple majority. It is completely within your power to stop the funding of the war in Iraq. You have simply chosen not to do so. In fact, I did a little homework. The Speaker of the House of Representatives decides which pieces of legislation even come to the floor of the House debate and/or a vote."

Cafferty repeatedly criticizes what he calls the Democrats' lack of action to honor their campaign promises to end the Iraq War: "The Democrats were handed a golden opportunity to challenge President Bush on the war when they were given control of Congress in the midterm elections last year. So far they have done absolutely nothing."<ref name="democrats"/>

===Middle East===
Cafferty has been accused of having a "simplistic"<ref name="middle east">  </ref> view of the Middle East. Cafferty courted controversy on September 23, 2004 while discussing terrorist demands for the release of two female scientists from an Iraqi prison and remarking: "Given the way these mutants treat women in their societies, the women are probably better off in U.S. custody. They treat women like furniture in those countries. If I was a woman, I think I’d rather be in an American jail cell than I would be living with one of those, whatever they are over there."<ref name="middle east"/>

On barbarian. Somehow, I wouldn’t be too concerned about the sensitivity of the Arab world. They don’t seem to have very much. It’s going to come down to them or us."<ref name="middle east"/> The next day the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee accused Cafferty of "hateful rhetoric" and stated that he had "a history of insensitive remarks towards many minority groups".<ref name="middle east"/>
