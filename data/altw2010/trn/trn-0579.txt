'''South Dakota''' (( ) is a state located in the Midwestern region of the Lakota and Dakota (American Indian tribes. South Dakota was admitted to the Union on Pierre serves as the state capital, and Sioux Falls, with 150,000 people, is the largest city in the state. 

Located in the north-central United States, South Dakota is bisected by the West River" and "East River".<ref name=eastwestriver>Hasselstrom, Linda: ''Roadside History of South Dakota'', pages 2-4. Mountain Press Publishing Company, 1994</ref> Rich soil in the eastern part of the state is used to grow a variety of crops, while American Indians as well as a major draw for the state tourism industry, the Black Hills are also the location of Mt. Rushmore, probably the best-known location in the state and a widely used symbol of South Dakota.

Historically dominated by an agricultural economy and a rural lifestyle, South Dakota has recently sought to diversify its economy in an effort to attract and retain residents. The state is still largely rural, though, with one of the lowest population densities in the United States.<ref></ref> While several notable Democratic senators have represented South Dakota at the federal level, the state's government is largely dominated by the Republican Party, and Republicans have carried South Dakota in the last ten presidential elections.

==Geography==

South Dakota is situated in the north-central United States, and is usually considered to be a part of the West. The 17<sup>th</sup> largest in the Union.<ref name=SDArea/> South Dakota is bordered to the north by Butte County.<ref name=usgs2></ref>

===Regions===
South Dakota has four major land regions: the Drift Prairie, the Dissected Till Plains, the Great Plains, and the Black Hills.

The Drift Prairie covers most of eastern South Dakota. This is the land of low hills and glacial lakes. This area was called Coteau des Prairies (Prairie Hills) by early French traders. In the north, the Coteau des Prairies is bordered on the east by the James River through South Dakota from north to south.

The Dissected Till Plains lie in the southeastern corner of South Dakota. This area of rolling hills is criss-crossed by many streams.
left|thumb|Geographic and political features of South Dakota
The Great Plains cover most of the western two-thirds of South Dakota. The Coteau de Missouri hills and valleys lie between the James River Basin of the Drift Prairie and the Missouri River. West of the Missouri River the landscape becomes more rugged and consists of rolling hills, plains, canyons, and steep flat-topped hills called feet (120 to 180&nbsp;m) above the plains. In the south, east of the Black Hills, lie the South Dakota Badlands.

The Black Hills are in the southwestern part of South Dakota and extend into Wyoming. This range of low mountains covers 6,000 km².) with mountains that rise from 2,000 to 4,000 feet (600 to 1,200&nbsp;m) above their bases. The highest point in South Dakota, Homestake Mine, one of the largest gold mines in the United States, is located in the Black Hills.

South Dakotans also divide the state at the Missouri River into two general regions, known as West River and East River. The river serves as a somewhat stark boundary in terms of geographic, social and political differences between the two regions. West River features a more arid landscape, an economy largely based on tourism and ranching, and, aside from the Indian Reservations, a very conservative political climate. East River, on the other hand, is more densely populated, agriculture there is based more on farming than ranching, and the region is more politically moderate.<ref name=eastwestriver/><ref>Johnson, Dirk. ''Gold Divides Dakotans as River Did'' [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DF1539F93AA35753C1A96E948260] The New York Times. 9 October 1988. (accessed 14 February, 2008)</ref>

The Missouri River is the largest and longest river in the state. Other major South Dakota rivers include the Cheyenne, the James, the Big Sioux, and the White. South Dakota has many natural lakes, mostly occurring in the eastern part of the state. Additionally, Lake Oahe, Lake Sharpe, Lake Francis Case, and Lewis and Clark Lake.

===Ecology===
thumb|right|160px|A [[pronghorn in Wind Cave National Park]]
Much of South Dakota, with the notable exception of the Black Hills, is dominated by a temperate grasslands biome.<ref></ref> Although grasses and crops cover most of this region, deciduous trees such as cottonwoods, elms, and willows are common near rivers and in shelter belts.<ref></ref> 
bison, ring-necked pheasant, has adapted particularly well to the area after being introduced from pike, and bass, along with other species.<ref name=SDFauna/> The Missouri River also contains the pre-historic paddlefish.<ref></ref>

Due to higher elevation and precipitation, the ecology of the Black Hills differs significantly from that of the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by various types of ponderosa and elk (wapiti), bighorn sheep, mountain goats, and mountain lions, while the streams and lakes contain several species of trout.<ref name=SDFauna/><ref></ref><ref></ref>

===Climate===
South Dakota has a continental climate with four very distinct seasons ranging from typically very cold winters and hot summers. During the summers, the average high temperature throughout the state is close to 90 °F , although it often cools down to close to 60 °F at night. It is not unusual for South Dakota to have severe hot, dry spells in the summer with the temperature climbing above 100 °F for the high temperature for days or weeks at a time. Winters are cold with high temperatures in January averaging below freezing and low temperatures averaging below 10 °F in most of the state.

The precipitation of the state ranges from semi-arid, in the northwestern part of the state (around 15 inches of annual precipitation) to semi-humid around the southeast portion of the state (around 25 inches of annual precipitation), although a small area centered around Lawrence County has the highest precipitation at nearly 30 inches per annum.

South Dakota summers bring frequent thunderstorms which can be severe with high winds, thunder, and hail. The eastern part of the state is often considered part of tornado alley,<ref></ref> and South Dakota experiences an average of 23 tornadoes per year.<ref></ref> Winters are somewhat more stable, although severe weather in the form of blizzards and ice storms can occur during the season.

==History==<!-- This section is linked from List of capitals in the United States -->

Human beings have lived in what is today South Dakota for at least several thousand years. French and other European explorers in the 1700s encountered a variety of groups including the Omaha and Dakota, Lakota, and LaVerendrye brothers buried a plate near the site of modern day Pierre, claiming the region for greater Louisiana.<ref></ref> 

In 1803, the United States purchased the 1858 Treaty, ceding most of present-day eastern South Dakota to the United States.<ref></ref>
thumb|right|160px|[[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood, like many other Black Hills towns, was founded after the discovery of gold]]

Land speculators founded two of eastern South Dakota's largest present-day cities: Yankton in 1859. In 1861, Dakota Territory was established by the United States government (this initially included North Dakota, South Dakota, and parts of Montana and Wyoming).<ref></ref>  Settlers from Scandinavia, Germany, Ireland, and Russia, as well as elsewhere in Europe and from the eastern U.S. states increased from a trickle to a flood, especially after the completion of an eastern railway link to the territorial capital of Yankton in 1872, and the discovery of gold in the Black Hills in 1874 during a military expedition led by George A. Custer. This expedition took place despite the fact that the western half of present day South Dakota had been granted to the Sioux by the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) as part of the Great Sioux Reservation. The Sioux declined to grant mining rights or land in the Black Hills, and war broke out after the U.S. failed to stop white miners and settlers from entering the region. The Sioux were eventually defeated and settled on reservations within South Dakota and North Dakota.<ref name=SDChrono/>

An increasing population caused Dakota Territory to be divided in half and a bill for statehood for North Dakota and South Dakota (as well as Secretary of State, James G. Blaine, to shuffle the papers and obscure from him which he was signing first and the actual order went unrecorded.<ref>[http://www.usmint.gov/kids/coinNews/coinOfTheMonth/2006/09.cfm U.S. Mint Coin of the Month]</ref><ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award97/ndfahtml/ngp_nd_terr.html Library of Congress, Dakota Territory and Statehood]</ref>

On December 29, 1890, the Wounded Knee Massacre occurred on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Commonly cited as the last major armed conflict between the United States and the Sioux Nation, the massacre resulted in the deaths of an estimated 300 Sioux, many of them women and children. 25 U.S. soldiers were also killed in the conflict.<ref></ref>

left|thumb|200px|A South Dakota farm during the [[Dust Bowl, 1936]]
During the 1930s, several economic and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and over-cultivation of farmland produced what was known as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plains states. Fertile topsoil was blown away in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined.<ref></ref> The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state. The population of South Dakota declined by more than seven percent between 1930 and 1940.

Economic stability returned with the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war. In 1944, the Pick-Sloan Plan was passed as part of the Flood Control Act of 1944 by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially located in South Dakota. Flood control, hydroelectricity and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs.<ref></ref>

In recent decades, South Dakota has transformed from a state dominated by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since the completion of the interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills being especially impacted. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with Homestake gold mine near Lead was chosen as the location of a new underground research facility.<ref></ref> Despite a growing state population and recent economic development, many rural areas have been struggling over the past 50 years with locally declining populations and the emigration of educated young adults to larger South Dakota cities, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states.<ref></ref>

===Population===
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2005, South Dakota has an estimated population of 775,933, which is an increase of 5,312, or 0.7%, from the prior year and an increase of 21,093, or 2.8%, since the year 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 19,199 people (that is 56,247 births minus 37,048 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 3,222 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 3,957 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 735 people. 6.8% of South Dakota's population were reported as under 5, 26.8% under 18, and 14.3% were 65 or older. Females made up approximately 50.4% of the population.

===Race and ethnicity===
In 2005, the Census Bureau estimated that 88.5% of South Dakotans were White, 8.8% were American Indian or Black, 0.7% were Asian, while 2.1% belonged to more than one race.<ref name = SDQuickfacts/> The five largest ancestry groups in South Dakota are: German (40.7%), Norwegian (15.3%), Irish (10.4%), Native American (8.3%), and English (7.1%). German-Americans are the largest ancestry group in most parts of the state, especially in the east, although there are also large Scandinavian populations in some counties. American Indians, largely Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota (Sioux) are predominant in several counties. South Dakota has the fourth highest proportion of Native Americans of any state, behind Alaska, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.
thumb|left|South Dakota has a number of large [[Indian Reservation|Indian reservations (shown in pink).]] As of the 2000 census, 1.90% of the population aged 5 or older speak German at home, while 1.51% speak Dakota, and 1.43% Spanish.<ref></ref>

===Growth and rural flight===
South Dakota, in common with five other Midwest states (Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and Iowa), is experiencing a trend of falling populations in rural counties, despite an overall increase in population for all of these states except North Dakota. 89% of the total number of cities in these six states have fewer than 3,000 people; hundreds have fewer than 1000. Between 1996 and 2004, almost half a million people, nearly half with college degrees, left the six states. "Rural flight" as it is called has led to offers of free land and tax breaks as enticements to newcomers.

The effect of rural flight has not been spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural counties and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area and the Black Hills have gained population. In fact, Lincoln County, near Sioux Falls, is the ninth-fastest growing county (by percentage) in the United States.<ref></ref> The growth in these areas has compensated for losses in the rest of the state, and South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.<ref name=SDQuickfacts/>

===Religion===
According to a 2001 survey, 86% of South Dakotans described themselves as being members of a Christian denomination:<ref></ref>

*Protestant (61%)
**Lutheran (27%)
**Methodist (13%)
**Baptist (4%)
**Presbyterian (4%)
**Other Protestant (6%) 
**Non-denominational Christian (7%)
*Roman Catholic (25%) 
*Not religious (8%)
*A non-Christian religion (3%) 
*2% refused to answer.

==Economy==
thumb|right|180px|A [[B-1B Lancer lifts off from Ellsworth Air Force Base, one of South Dakota's largest employers]]
The current-dollar gross state product of South Dakota was $32.3 billion as of 2006.<ref></ref> The per capita personal income was $26,894 in 2004, the 37th highest in the nation and 13.08 percent below the national average. 13.2% of the population is below the poverty line. As of July 2007, South Dakota's unemployment rate was 3.0%, the fifth-lowest jobless rate in the nation.<ref></ref> 

The service industry is the largest economic contributor in South Dakota. This sector includes the retail, finance, and health care industries. Government spending is another important segment of the state's economy, providing over ten percent of the gross state product.<ref></ref> Ellsworth Air Force Base, near Rapid City, is the second-largest single employer in the state.<ref>Reha, Bob. ''South Dakota's Ellsworth AFB to stay open.'' [http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/08/26_rehab_ellsworthopen/] Minnesota Public Radio. 26 August 2005. (accessed 8 September, 2007)</ref> 

thumb|left|180px|[[Ethanol plant in Turner County]]
corn (maize), hogs, and wheat.<ref></ref> Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state. South Dakota is one of the top five ethanol-producing states in the nation.<ref></ref> 

Another important sector in South Dakota's economy is tourism. Many travel to view the attractions of the state, particularly those of the Black Hills region such as historic Deadwood, Mt. Rushmore, and the nearby state and national parks. One of the largest tourist events in the state is the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The three-day event drew over 450,000 attendants in 2006, significant considering the state has a population of only 750,000.<ref></ref>  In 2006, tourism provided an estimated 33,000 jobs in the state and contributed over two billion US$ to the economy of South Dakota.<ref></ref>
===State taxes===
As of 2005, South Dakota has the lowest per capita total state tax rate in the United States.<ref></ref>  The state does not levy personal or corporate intangible personal property. The state Indians on Indian Reservations, but many reservations have a compact with the state. Businesses on the reservation collect the tax and the state refunds to the Indian Tribes the percentage of sales tax collections relating to the ratio of Indian population to total population in the county or area affected.

Ad valorem property taxes are local taxes and are a large source of funding for school systems, counties, municipalities and other local government units. Their administration is a local responsibility. The state revenue department does not collect or use property taxes, but it does centrally assess the property of large companies. The legislature sets some standards by general acts. The South Dakota Special Tax Division regulates some taxes including cigarette and alcohol related taxes.<ref></ref>

==Transportation==

left|thumb|110px|A [[rest area|rest stop "tipi" is a frequent sight on a trip across the state]]
South Dakota has a total of 83,609 miles of highways, roads, and streets, along with 679 miles of 190, a spur into central Rapid City, and 229, a loop around eastern and southern Sioux Falls. Several major 12, 14, 16, 18, and 212 travel east and west, while U.S. routes 81, 83, 85 and 281 run north and south. 

South Dakota contains two National Scenic Byways. The Peter Norbeck National Scenic Byway is located in the Black Hills, while the Native American Scenic Byway runs along the Missouri River in the north-central part of the state. Other scenic byways include the Badlands Loop Scenic Byway, the Spearfish Canyon Scenic Byway, and the Wildlife Loop Road Scenic Byway.<ref></ref>

Railroads have played an important role in South Dakota transportation since the mid nineteenth century.  Historically, the Chicago & North Western were the state's largest railroads, and the Milwaukee's east-west transcontinental line traversed the northern tier of the state.  Some 4,420 miles of railroad track were built in South Dakota during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but only 1,839 miles of railroad are currently operational.<ref></ref> BNSF Railway is currently the largest railroad in South Dakota, primarily operating former Milwaukee Road trackage; the Dakota, Minnesota, and Eastern Railroad is the state's other major carrier, mostly operating former Chicago & North Western trackage.<ref></ref><ref></ref>   Rail transportation in the state is confined only to freight, however, as South Dakota is one of the few states without any Amtrak service.<ref></ref> 

South Dakota's largest commercial airports are located at Sioux Falls and Rapid City.  Several other cities in the state also have commercial air service, some of which is subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.

South Dakota license plates are numbered by county, with the first digit referring to the county of origin. Such a numbering system allows one to easily determine where the vehicle was registered. Counties 1&ndash;9 are ranked by 1950 population, and counties 10&ndash;64 are numbered alphabetically.<ref></ref>

==Law and government==

right|thumb|200px|[[South Dakota State Capitol in Pierre]]

The state of South Dakota has three branches of government: executive, legislative, and  judicial.

The current governor is M. Michael Rounds.

Currently, there are 35 members of the state Senate and 70 members of the House of Representatives. The state is composed of 35 legislative districts. Voters elect one senator and two representatives from each district. The legislature meets for a thirty day session starting on the second Tuesday in January, and also if the governor calls a special session.

The state Supreme Court is the highest court in South Dakota and the court of last resort for state appellate actions. The chief justice and four justices comprise the South Dakota Supreme Court. South Dakota is divided into seven judicial circuits. There are 39 circuit judges serving in the seven circuits. magistrate judges in the seven circuits. Magistrate courts assist the circuit courts in disposing of misdemeanor criminal cases and minor civil actions. These courts of limited jurisdiction make the judicial system more accessible to the public by providing a means of direct court contact for the average citizen.
