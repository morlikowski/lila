The '''Ford Zephyr''' is a car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company in the Granada.

==History==
The Mark I Ford Consul and Zephyr models were first displayed at the Earls Court motor show in 1950. Production began with the Consul on January 1 1951. The Mark I model ran until 1956. From April 1956 the Mark II Consul, Zephyr and Zodiac went on sale and were known as the Three Graces. The Mark II range was a big seller and finished its run in 1962 when from April that year the Mark III Zephyr 4, Zephyr 6 and Zodiac went on sale; the Consul name was dropped, the car's place in the Ford UK line-up being filled by the first four cylinder Ford Zephyr. While the Mark II Zephyr and Zodiacs had shared the same body (although the Consul had a shortened front and tail), the new Zodiac and Zephyrs launched in 1962 shared few body panels. With the Mark III, Ford finally sorted out problems that had beset previous models (Mark I axles and Mark II gearboxes were particular weaknesses) and the Mark III proved to be the most popular and durable of the range (it is said that possibly no other UK-based car had undergone as much pre-production testing). The model sold at a rate equal or better than the Mark II both in the UK and overseas, but was in production for a shorter period of time. During the last months of production, an up-market Executive version was added to the Mark III range, and examples of these are today highly sought after. The Mk III range was discontinued in Jan 1966 (many believe prematurely given the cars' success) and the completely new Zephyr / Zodiac Mark IV range was released in April 1966. This car was somewhat ahead of its time with a design that resembled one of the later Consul/Granada range with V-engines and independent rear suspension, but the research and development of the model was very rushed and this unfortunately reflected in the car's durability.

Although the Ford Zephyr never saw American production, cars were imported into the US and the name itself has appeared on other American Ford-related cars: the Mercury Zephyr was an upscale version of the Ford Fairmont, and the Lincoln Zephyr began its second production run in 2006 (the first was from 1936 to 1942).

The first of the Zephyr range was a lengthened version of the Consul with a six cylinder 2262&nbsp;cc engine producing . Suspension was by coil springs at the front and a live axle with half elliptic springs at the rear. The car could reach just over  and 23&nbsp;mpg.

The Ford Zephyr Six was available with 4-door saloon, estate and 2-door convertible bodies. The convertible version was made by Abbotts of Farnham and was sold as the Farnham.

The car was a success in the market place but also in competition. In 1953 a Ford Zephyr 6 driven by "Gatso" speed cameras.) 

A saloon tested by The Motor magazine in 1951 had a top speed of  and could accelerate from 0- in 20.2 seconds. A fuel consumption of  was recorded. The test car cost £842 including taxes but was fitted with optional leather trim, heater and radio (the basic car cost £842). <ref name=Motor1951></ref>

The Zephyr Zodiac (or '''Zodiac Mark I''') was an upmarket version of the Zephyr launched at the London Motor Show in autumn 1953. It had two-tone paint, leather trim, heater, windscreen washers, whitewall tyres, spot lights, etc. The engine had a higher compression ratio - 7.5:1 instead of 6.8:1 - giving an increased power output of <ref name=Motor1955/>. There are no official records of Zodiac convertibles being produced but there were a few estate cars. Along with the Zephyr, the Zephyr Zodiac was one of the first cars to use MacPherson strut front suspension.

A car tested by The Motor magazine in 1955 had a top speed of  and could accelerate from 0- in 20.2 seconds. A fuel consumption of  was recorded. The test car cost £851 including taxes. <ref name=Motor1955></ref>

;Model number 206E

In 1956 the Consul, Zephyr, and Zodiac were all restyled to a new family look. The 6-cylinder cars had a their engines enlarged to 2553&nbsp;cc, withpower output correspondingly raised to <ref name=Motor1956/>  . The wheelbase was increased by  to  and the width increased to . The weight distribution and turning circle were also improved. Top speed increased to  and the economy was also better at . 

The Zodiac and Zephyr were also offered in two body styles these being the "Highline" and "Lowline", depending on the year of manufacture — the difference being   being cut from the height of the roof panel. The two models shared various slightly differing components, but are generally interchangeable between the two. The "Highline" variant featured a hemispherical instrument cluster, whereas the "Lowline" had a more rectangular panel. A locally-engineered version of each of these models was introduced to Australia. 

As well as a 3-speed manual gearbox there was an optional overdrive and from 1956 (1959 in Australia) a Borg Warner DG automatic transmission. At first drum brakes were fitted all round (with a larger lining area of 147 sq in) but front discs became optional in 1960 and standard from mid 1961 (in Australia only 4-wheel drum brakes were available; some dealers fitted servo-assistance from 1961).

A two-door convertible version was offered, and a pick-up and factory-built estate were sold on the Australian market. Owing to the structural weaknesses inherent in the construction of convertibles very few convertibles are known to survive: probably only 20-25 examples.

The Mark II Zodiac was slightly altered to distinguish it from the lesser variants, having more elaborate tail-end styling and at the front a different grille. The auxiliary lamps and wing mirrors were deleted from the Zodiac range but it retained two-tone paint, whitewall tyres, chrome wheel-trim embellishers and gold plated badges.

A car tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1956 had a top speed of  and could accelerate from 0- in 17.1 seconds. A fuel consumption of  was recorded. The test car cost £968 including taxes. <ref name=Motor1956></ref>

thumb|280px|Ford Zephyr Mk III
Der '''Ford Zephyr''' war ein Personenwagen der Ford Motor Company Großbritannien.

Der Zephyr und dessen Luxusausführung, '''Ford Zodiac''', der ab 1955 angeboten wurde, waren zwanzig Jahre lang die größten Personenwagen im Angebot des britischen Ford-Unternehmens. Im Jahre 1972 wurden sie durch die Consul- und Granada- Modelle ersetzt.

Trotz der Tatsache, dass der Ford Zephyr in den Vereinigten Staaten weder produziert noch verkauft wurde, erschien dessen Namensschild auf anderen Ford-Fahrzeugen, namentlich dem Mercury Zephyr, einer gehobenen Version des Ford Fairmont, sowie dem Lincoln Zephyr, welcher 2006 eine Neuauflage erlebt (die Originalversion erschien von 1936 bis 1942).

== Zephyr und Zodiac Mk I (1951-1956)==
thumb|Ford Zephyr Mk I
Das Modell Mk I wurde von 1951 bis 1956 produziert. Der Mk I war eine verlängerte Limousine auf Basis des Ford Consul I. Insgesamt wurden 148.629 Limousinen und 4.048 Cabrios hergestellt. Angetrieben wurde der Zephyr als Vertreter der oberen Mittelklasse mit einem 2262 ccm großen 6-Zylinder-Motor.

Ab 1954 wurde die luxuriösere Variante als ''Zodiac'' gebaut (ab 1955 auf dem Markt). Der verbesserte Motor hatte eine höhere Kompression. Vom Zodiac Mk I wurden 22.634 Limousinen produziert.

== Zephyr und Zodiac Mk II (1956-1961)==
thumb|Ford Zodiac Mk II
Das Modell Mk II (interne Typbezeichnung ''206E'') wurde von 1956 bis 1961 produziert. Zephyr und Zodiac bekamen nun einen neuen Familien Look gemeinsam mit dem Consul II.

Von Zephyr und Zodiac Mk II zusammen wurden 294.506 Limousinen und 6.911 Kabrios hergestellt.
