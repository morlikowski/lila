 is a retired assassin, a character introduced within the ''Guilty Gear'' fighting game series. Millia participated in the first game of the series, ''Guilty Gear'', as well as every game thereafter. She is easily noticeable by her long, "wild" hair. Her weapon of choice appears to be her own hair, which is prehensile and able to change its size and shape.

== Story ==
=== Background ===
Born of Russian descent, Millia lost both of her parents at an early age. She was thereafter adopted into a nearby Assassin Syndicate, where she practiced in the art of Hi-Deigokutsuipou, or the "Six Forbidden Magics". Using the Sixth Hi-Deigokutsuipou, "Angra", Millia's hair gained the abilities she currently possesses. Zato-1 practiced a similar technique, the Fifth Forbidden Magic, "Shokusei Kagejin", by sacrificing his sense of sight.

Due to Zato-1's rise in power within the Guild, Millia betrayed her "comrade", sealing him within a dimensional portal. Millia abandoned the Guild shortly thereafter, finding no comfort in the cruel ways of an assassin. The Guild leader eventually escaped, enraged at Millia's actions, leading to an overall hatred of women.

=== ''Guilty Gear'' ===
Upon hearing of Justice from her slumber. However, she is promptly destroyed by none other than Sol Badguy.

=== ''Guilty Gear X'' ===
Still in search of Zato-1, Millia hears mention of a Gear with free-will. Panicked countries establish another "tournament", with a prize of 500,000 World Dollars to he who captures, dead or alive, the aforementioned Gear. Rage uses this as yet another chance to find Zato. Canonically, the former assassin finally finds Zato, seemingly ending his life. Unknown to her, Eddie takes control of Zato's body thereafter, having been slowly gaining control over Zato since the bonding with its master.

=== ''Guilty Gear XX'' ===
After the "death" of Commander Gear Dizzy, as well as Zato-1, Millia continued living in her familiar solitude. However, it was not long before she received sightings of a being similar to that of Zato's Forbidden Beast, Eddie. Encountering many familiar, as well as new, faces along the way, Millia once again confronts Eddie. 

In ''XX'', Millia has three different endings, all of which conclude upon her search for Eddie. In the first, Slayer bars her path just before she is about to confront Eddie. After a fight Millia manages to hold her ground but is unable to defeat him, Slayer "reveals" to Millia that her hair is of the same origins as Eddie, though Millia replies that "[she] knows this better than anybody." In the second ending she manages to defeat Slayer and pass on through to then subsequently kill Eddie; fatigued and relived, Millia returns to her new life. The third ending is very similar to the second albeit with a much brighter outcome. After killing Eddie, she buries Zato's body, leaving her hair and Zato's blindfold as a memento. She thanks him and leaves.

==Relationships==
===Zato-1/Eddie===
Comrades during her stay in the Assassin Syndicate, Millia was the one responsible for Zato's dimensional imprisonment. One of the major relationships throughout the story, Millia's hatred for Eddie, will not cease until his utter demise.
