'''The Da Vinci Code''' ''(rolin kryesor, filmi bazohet në fiksion/trillim.

Filmi e ka për temë Maria Magdalenën. Sipas librit që filmi është bazuar, Jezusi dhe Magdalena kanë pasur një vajzë, por ketë sekret kisha katolike do që ta fshehë.

== Përmbajtja ==

Një nga librat më të shitur të kohëve të fundit në botë, “Kodi i Da Vinçit” me 7.5 milion kopje nga Dan Braun, u prezantua së fundi edhe në Shqipëri në panairin kombëtar të librit të organizuar tek Piramida. “Kodi i Da Vinçit” është një roman policesk, i cili luan me historinë dhe imagjinatën. Personazhet kryesorë të romanit Robert Langdon (simbologjist) dhe Sofie Nuve (detektive) hetojnë së bashku vrasjen misterioze të gjyshit të Sofisë. Ndërsa ndjekin shënimet dhe gjurmët që kishte lënë gjyshi i saj, Sofie dhe Langdon zbulojnë se gjyshi ishte anëtar i një organizate të fshehtë me emrin Parësia e Sionit. Organizata gjoja synon ruajtjen e eshtrave të Maria Magdalenës dhe të dokumenteve të rëndësishme që datonin që në kohën e saj. Sipas librit Maria Magdalena paraqitet si ish gruaja e Jezuit dhe përfaqësuese e shenjtërisë femërore. 

Libri flet gjithashtu për Gralin e Shenjtë (sipas legjendave kupa e darkës së fu-ndit) që simbolizonte vetë Maria Magdalenën e cila gjoja mbante në barkun e saj pasardhësit e Jezuit. Kisha sipas autorit të librit e sulmoi “she-njtërinë femërore” dhe anatemoi femrën duke ulur rëndësinë e saj. Adhurimin i Jezuit, po sipas librit, ishte diçka që e shpiku perandori Kostandin në këshillin e Nikesë (Turqia e sotme) në vitin 325 para Krishtit për të forcuar pozitat e veta meqë krishtërimi po bëhej më i “su-ksesshëm” se paganizmi. Këto dhe teori të tjera që dalin nga libri janë krejtësisht në kundërshtim me bazat e besimit të krishterë. 

Shumë nga përfundimet në të cilat dalin personazhet, disa prej të cilave i për-mendëm më sipër, janë vërtetë qesharake. Për të dalë në teoritë e tij fantasktiko-"teologjike" autori bazohet në legjenda, ungjij gnostikë (të tipit Ungjilli i Maria Magdalenës), romane pseudo-kërkimor, gjysëm të vërteta, shtrembërime historike etj. 

Këtyre autori u bashkangjit besime apo filozofi lindore, egjyptiane, pagane, masonike etj., për të krijuar një ama-lgamë, e cila e shërbyer në një mënyrë të caktuar, të çon në pikëpamjen e gabuar të kohërave të sotme se të gjitha fetë qenkan njëlloj. 

Një fakt interesant mbi librin ishte se në fillim, personazhet niseshin për të gjetur të vërtetën. Dhe, kur pas shumë peripecish “e gjejnë” atë, mendojnë se nuk është e rëndësishme që njerëzit ta njohin, por më e rëndësishme ështe që njerëzit të besojnë në ekzistencën e diçkaje që i frymëzon, qoftë kjo dhe një legjendë. Pra, me fjalë të tjera, e vërteta absolute nuk ekziston, e vërtetë është ajo që ti beson, ose më saktë ajo që ti dëshiron. Edhe kjo është një pikëpamje kaq e gabuar në botë sot.

__TOC__

==Plot summary==
A man revealed to be Silas through the Grand Gallery in the Church of Saint-Sulpice, "beneath the Rose."  Silas thanks him, and then shoots him in the stomach.

Meanwhile, American symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), who is in Paris as a guest lecturer on Symbols and the sacred feminine, is contacted by the French police, and summoned to the Louvre to view the crime scene.  He discovers the dying Saunière had created an intricate display using black light ink and his own body and blood.  Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) asks him for his interpretation of the puzzling scene.

Silas calls a mysterious man known as flagellate himself with a whip for the sins of murder.  Facilitated by Bishop Manuel Aringarosa, Silas then travels to Saint-Sulpice and is admitted by an elderly nun; left alone, he excavates beneath the floor of the church to find a stone saying only JOB 38:11.  He confronts the nun, who quotes the passage:  "Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further."  Realizing that he has been deceived, Silas is enraged and kills the nun.

crack the code.

Having bought some time by removing the tracking device, the pair begin exploring the Louvre, finding more anagram messages that Saunière had left behind.  Many of these relate to Madonna of the Rocks.

Pursued by the French Police and cut off from the United States Embassy, the pair escape to the Bois de Boulogne where Langdon closely inspects the key. He notices an inscription on the side -- an address. The address directs them to the Depository Bank of Zurich where the key is used for a safety deposit box.

In the bank, they find Saunière's deposit box and open it using the 10 digit Fibonacci numbers in order (1123581321). Inside the box, they find a rosewood container, which contains a cryptex: a cylindrical container with five alphabetical dials which must be arranged in the correct sequence to spell out a 5-letter code word, in order to open and access the parchment message inside.  Using force to open the cryptex would break a vial of vinegar inside, which would dissolve the parchment and destroy the message.

Unfortunately, the police are called by a security guard and they are forced to leave. The bank manager, Andre Vernet, assists them in escaping by taking them as passengers in an armoured truck to escape the routine checks of the police. In the back of the truck Langdon and Neveu have a lengthy discussion about the cryptex and Neveu says that her grandfather often played games with her involving cryptexes.  Langdon says that the cryptex might hold valuable information or another clue about what they are trying to discover. Eventually, they come to a sudden stop and Vernet forces them at gunpoint to give them the cryptex. Langdon tricks Vernet and disarms him and he and Sophie escape.

Langdon suggests that they visit his friend, Leigh Teabing, for assistance to opening the cryptex. Leigh Teabing turns out to be an enthusiastic seeker of the Holy Grail, which he believes is not actually a cup but instead Mary Magdalene, the wife of Christ, who was driven away because Jesus's followers didn't want to follow a woman after their leader was killed. Mary was pregnant at the time, and Teabing tells Sophie that a secret society was formed to protect the descendants of Jesus. Jacques Saunière was believed to be a part of this society and Teabing suspects that he was training Sophie to join it also. Silas, meanwhile, breaks into Teabing's mansion and attempts to steal the cryptex. Teabing uses his cane to knock Silas out and they escape again, taking the butler, Remy Jean, and Silas with them. The group escapes in Teabing's plane

It is revealed that Remy Jean is actually a follower of The Teacher as well, however he is killed by the mysterious man after freeing Silas. Silas is attacked by the police and, in the ensuing gunfire, accidentally shoots Bishop Manuel Aringarosa. In his grief, Silas dies in police-assisted suicide and Aringarosa is taken to the hospital. As Langdon gets closer to solving the mystery, he is betrayed by Teabing, who is revealed to be The Teacher. Teabing explained that he wanted to find Mary Magdalene's remains to prove he was correct about the Holy Grail and threatens to shoot Sophie  if Langdon does not crack the code. Langdon responds by throwning the cryptex into the air. Teabing runs to catch it, but cannot, and it hits the ground. The vial of vinegar breaks, spreads onto the document destroying it. Teabing is arrested, however it is revealed that Langdon had cracked the code ('Apple'). Using the clue, they travel to a church where Magdalene's remains had previously been hidden. There, they meet other members of the secret organization that protected her. It is revealed that Sophie is actually Magdalene's descendent, and they vow to keep her safe. Langdon and Sophie part ways shortly after.

At his hotel, Langdon accidentally cuts himself and the line of blood on the sink reminds him of the Rose Line. He follows the Rose Line and finds the location of the Holy Grail, buried under the pyramid in the Louvre. Langdon then kneels above Mary Magdalene's tomb as the Templar Knights did before him.

==Filming==
The film rights were purchased from Dan Brown for $6,000,000. Filming had been scheduled to start in May 2005; however, some delays caused filming to begin on June 30, 2005. 

===Location===
Permission to film on the premises was granted to the film by the Louvre (although, since the crew was not permitted to shine light on the Saint-Sulpice. The Westminster Abbey scenes were instead filmed at Lincoln Cathedral and Winchester Cathedral, both belonging to the Church of England. 

Due to the denial of a location permit for Saint-Sulpice<ref>Michael Haag & Veronica Haag, with James McConnachie, ''The Rough Guide to The Da Vinci Code: An Unauthorised Guide to the Book and Movie'' (Rough Guides Ltd; 2006)</ref> the entire scene had to be recreated virtually by Rainmaker U.K and though the set had been partially built, the co-ordinates were centimeters out from what the compositors had expected and so the entire process was unbelievably hard to complete.<ref>http://www.aip.org/isns/reports/2006/009.html ''Saint-Sulpice Chapel - The Da Vinci Code's Best Kept Secret''</ref> 

Lincoln reportedly received £100,000 in exchange for the right to film there, with filming there occurring between 15 and 19 August 2005, mainly within the cloisters of the cathedral. The Cathedral's bell "Great Tom", which strikes the hour, was silent for the first time since World War II during that time. Although it remained a closed set, protesters led by the 61-year-old Roman Catholic nun Sister Mary Michael from Our Lady's Community of Peace and Mercy in Lincoln demonstrated against the filming, spending 12 hours praying on her knees outside the cathedral in protest against what she sees as the blasphemous use of a holy place to film a book which she considers to contain heresy.<ref>[http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20411-1736514,00.html TimesOnline: Nun protests over cathedral filming of Da Vinci Code]</ref>

Filming also took place elsewhere in the UK (London, including the concert hall in the Fairfield Halls, Croydon, the Temple Church, and Burghley House), Rosslyn Chapel, Scotland and in France and Germany.

===Studio shoots===

Alternate versions of Paul Bettany's nude flagellation scenes were shot, in which he wears a black loincloth. Clips of these versions appear in the History Channel's "Opus Dei Unveiled" documentary, aired in summer 2006.

==Pre-release reactions==
====The Vatican====
At a conference on curial department formerly known as the Holy Office, Archbishop Angelo Amato, specifically called for a boycott of the film version of ''The Da Vinci Code''; he said the movie is "full of calumnies, offences, and historical and theological errors."<ref></ref>

Cardinal Francis Arinze, in a documentary called "''The Da Vinci Code: A Masterful Deception''," urged unspecified legal action against the makers of the film.
"Those who blaspheme Christ and get away with it are exploiting the Christian readiness to forgive and to love even those who insult us. There are some other religions which if you insult their founder they will not be just talking. They will make it painfully clear to you," Arinze said. He is Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments in the Vatican.

====Opus Dei====
Stating that it does not intend to organize any boycotts, Catholic organization that is featured prominently in the novel and the film) released a statement on February 14, 2006 asking Sony Pictures to consider editing the soon-to-be-released film based on the bestseller, so that it would not contain references that it felt might be hurtful to Catholics. The statement also said Brown’s book offers a "deformed" image of the church and that Opus Dei will use the opportunity of the movie’s release to educate about the church. 

On Easter, April 16, 2006, Opus Dei published an open letter by the Japanese Information Office of Opus Dei mildly proposing that Sony Pictures consider including a disclaimer on the film adaptation as a "sign of respect towards the figure of Jesus Christ, the history of the Church, and the religious beliefs of viewers." The organization also encouraged the studio to clearly label the movie as fictitious "and that any resemblance to reality is pure coincidence."

According to a statement by Manuel Sánchez Hurtado, Opus Dei Press Office Rome,<ref></ref> 
in contrast to Sony Corporation’s published "Code of Conduct" the company has announced that the film will not include such a disclaimer.

====American Catholic bishops====
U.S. Catholic bishops launched a [http://www.jesusdecoded.com/ website] refuting the key claims in the novel that were about to be brought to the screen. The bishops are concerned about errors and serious misstatements in ''The Da Vinci Code''. The film has also been rated morally offensive &ndash; by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Office for Film and Broadcasting, which denounced its depiction of both the Jesus-Mary Magdalene relationship and that of Opus Dei as "deeply abhorrent."

====Peru====
The Peruvian Episcopal Conference (CEP) declared the movie&mdash;and the book&mdash;as part of a "systematic attack on the Catholic Church".<ref>[http://www.rpp.com.pe/portada/religion/37699_1.php RPP Noticias - “Código da Vinci” presenta grandes falsedades, afirman obispos del Perú<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>Furthermore, the Archbishop of Lima, the controversial Cardinal and member of Opus Dei Juan Luis Cipriani, urged his community not to see the film: "If someone goes (to see the movie), they are giving money to those who hurt the faith. It's not a problem of fiction; if truth is not respected, what arises we could call white glove terrorism."<ref>[http://www.arzobispadodelima.org/dialogo/2006/d_130506.htm Cardenal Cipriani pide a fieles abstenerse de ver “El Código Da Vinci”<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Cannes film festival===
During a preview for movie critics in Cannes, the main climax of the film, when Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) discloses to Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) that she is "without a doubt" the "last living descendant of Jesus Christ," was met with thunderous laughter. Nearing the end of the screening, the conclusion of the movie was met with boos instead of the usual applause.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=2ca605b1-79e2-43d8-9a53-7f0f77b21ab5&k=55649 Entertainment - Entertainment News, Music, Movies, TV Listings and more<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===NOAH===
The National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH) has expressed concern about Silas' character giving people with albinism a bad name. However,
the filmmakers did not change his appearance. See also evil albino.

===People's Republic of China===
Although the Da Vinci code was passed by Chinese censors, it was abruptly removed from public view in Mainland China, by order of the Chinese government, after "a remarkable run in China, grossing over $13 million".<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Movies/06/08/vincicode.china/index.html CNN.com - China dumps 'Da Vinci Code' - Jun 8, 2006<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> No explanation was given.
Its last screening was made on 9 June 2006.

===Faroe Islands===
The biggest cinema in the Faroe Islands, Havnar Bio, decided to boycott the film, effectively blocking it from the other smaller cinemas, who rely on second-hand films from this source, because it seems to be blasphemous in their point of view.<ref>[http://www.playfuls.com/news_000971_Da_Vinci_Code_Movie_Not_To_Be_Screened_On_Faroe_Islands_.html Playfuls.com - Play your life!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 
Havnar Bio is privately owned, and their decision is based on their own private opinion.

A private initiative by the individual Herluf Sørensen has arranged the movie to be played, despite the boycott by Havnar bio. The movie opened at the Nordic House in the Faroe Islands on the 5 June 2006.

===Philippines===

The Philippine Alliance Against Pornography (PAAP) appealed to Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to stop the showing of The Da Vinci Code in the Philippines. They branded the film as "the most pornographic and blasphemous film in history" and also requested the help of Pope Benedict XVI, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and other religious groups to stop the showing of the film.[1] In addition, they compared Dan Brown to Adolf Hitler.

However, Cecille Guidote Alvarez, Philippine Presidential Adviser on Culture and the Arts, said Malacañang will not interfere in controversy about the film and leaves the decision to the Movie and Television Classification Board's (MTRCB) rating.[2] Eventually, MTRCB decided to give The Da Vinci Code an R rating (restricted to those under 17 years of age if unaccompanied by a parent or an adult) despite PAAP's opposition for showing it.

===Thailand===
Christian groups in this mostly Buddhist country protested the film and called for it to be banned. On May 16, 2006, the Thai Censorship Committee issued a ruling that the film would be shown, but that the last 10 minutes would be cut. Also, some Thai subtitles were to be edited to change their meaning and passages from the Bible would also be quoted at the beginning and end of the film.

However, the following day, Sony Pictures appealed the ruling, saying it would pull the film if the decision to cut it was not reversed. The censorship panel then voted 6-5 that the film could be shown uncut, but that a disclaimer would precede and follow the film, saying it was a work of fiction.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/17/headlines/headlines_30004223.php "The Da Vinci Code" can be shown uncut<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.manager.co.th/IHT/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9490000064856 IHT ThaiDay - Manager Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This last-minute decision caused the premiere, opening-day showing of the movie to be delayed or cancelled in some provincial theatres as the updated film reels were shipped from Bangkok.

===Singapore===
The National Council of Churches of Singapore (NCCS) wrote to Information, Communications and the Arts Minister to register their "strongest objection" to the release of the film and requested that it be banned. The Media Development Authority, however, passed the unedited version of the movie, albeit with an NC16 rating, a restriction for children below the age of 16.<ref>http://www.todayonline.com/articles/119077.asp</ref>

===Samoa===
The film was banned outright in Samoa after church leaders watching a pre-release showing filed a complaint to film censors.<ref>http://www.nzherald.co.nz/search/story.cfm?storyid=00077629-C13F-1471-9B8883027AF1010E</ref>

===India===
There was a huge outcry in many states by the Christian minorities to ban the film from screening in India for the perceived anti-Christian message. This issue had even brought the minister responsible to view the film along with the senior Catholic representatives.
