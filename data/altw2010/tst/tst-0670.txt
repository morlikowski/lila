'''Фанґ''' (мфанґ, панґве) – група народів Центральній Африці.

== Розселення, чисельність, мова і релігія ==
Представники народів фанґ живуть у Екваторіальній Гвінеї (0,28 млн. чоловік), ще 5 тис. чоловік живуть у Конго.

Народи фанґ розмовляють окремими мовами банту. За релігією більшість фанг прибічники традиційних культів; також є протестанти, католики й послідовники афро-християнских сект. 

== Дані з історії, господарства і суспільства ==
Предки народів фанґ переселилися з басейну річки Конго на початку ХІХ століття, відтіснивши пігмеїв.

The '''Beti-Pahuin''' are a group of related peoples who inhabit the Bantu subgroup of the mutually intelligible and are thus sometimes considered to be dialects of a single tongue, called Beti.

==Group distinctions==
The Beti-Pahuin are made up of over 20 individual ethnic groups. Altogether, they inhabit a territory of forests and rolling hills that stretches from the Sanaga River in the north to Equatorial Guinea and the northern halves of Gabon to Congo to the south, and from the Atlantic Ocean to the west to the Dja River in the east. Due to a long shared history and a great deal of intermarriage between the various groups, distinguishing different peoples can often prove difficult. Nevertheless, a northern-southern distinction is sometimes drawn, or the peoples are classified along linguistic lines.

===Beti===
The first grouping, called the '''Beti''', consists of the '''Ewondo''', '''Bane''', '''Fang''', '''Mbida-Mbane''', '''Mvog-Nyenge''', and '''Eton'''. The Eton are further subdivided into the '''Eton-Beti''', '''Eton-Beloua''', and '''Beloua-Eton'''.

The Ewondo, or Yaunde, are centred on Mfoundi and Centre Province. The remainder of their territory lies in the northern portions of the South Province. Their language (or Beti dialect), also called Ewondo, is the most widely spoken of the Beti languages in Cameroon, with an estimated 577,700 speakers in 1982. It serves as a ''lingua franca'' in Yaoundé and much of the rest of Cameroon's Centre and South Provinces.

The Eton live primarily in the Sa'a and Obala. They speak the Eton language or dialect, which had 52,000 speakers in 1982.

===Fang===<!-- This section is linked from Equatorial Guinea -->
The Fang (or Fan) form the second group. Individual ethnic groups include the '''Fang''' proper, the '''Ntumu''', the '''Mvae''', and the '''Okak'''. Fang territories begin at the southern edge of Cameroon south of Congo.  The Fang are present in greatest numbers in Gabon, Equatorial Guinea (including the island of Bioko), and São Tomé and Príncipe and small numbers in the Congo.  In Equatorial Guinea the Fang have been the politically dominant group since independence, not only in Rio Muni on the mainland but also on the island of Bioko where they are a minority.  They are the most numerous of the Beti-Pahuin peoples, and their language was estimated to have had more than 858,000 speakers in 1993.

The Fang are renowned for their sculpture, which seems to have figured in the early development of cubism. [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/exhibita/stories/2006/1629386.htm] [http://www.randafricanart.com/Fang_style_comparison.html] [http://www.randafricanart.com/Fang_an_epic_journey.html]

===Bulu===<!-- This section is linked from Bulu -->
The third grouping is called the '''Bulu''' and makes up about a third of all Beti-Pahuin in Cameroon. The Bulu include the '''Bulu''' proper of Ntem and Upper Sanaga and East Province. They numbered as many as 660,000 in the late 20th century, and their language, called Bulu, is spoken by approximately 800,000 people as a second language.

===Other groups===
In addition, several other peoples are currently being assimilated or "Pahuinised" by their Beti-Pahuin neighbours. These include the '''Baka'''.

==History==
===Early population movements===

The Beti-Pahuin's exact origins are unclear. At one point, they were thought to have migrated into the territory of present-day Cameroon from the Azande area of Sudan, but the current belief is that they originated in the forests south of the Sanaga River, not far from their current territory. At some point they crossed the Sanaga and moved north until they reached the upper Kadéï River. They soon came under attack there from the Vute or Mbum people, so they fled further north to the eastern Adamawa Plateau.

The Beti-Pahuin groups would not remain there long, however. Their migration coincided with the jihad and Fulbe (Fula) conquests of Usman Dan Fodio and his lieutenant, Modibo Adama, in the early 19th century. Under pressure from Fulbe raiders, the Vute moved once more into Beti-Pahuin lands, and the Beti-Pahuin were forced to relocate once again. They moved south and west in a series of waves. The first group included the Bulu and Fang, who split somewhere near what is today the town of Ebolowa. The Bulu followed the Nyong River westward, while the Fang turned south and followed the Dja River valley into the southernmost territories of modern Cameroon and into the area of present-day Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. Then the Ntumu and Mvae (Fang subgroups) moved toward present-day Gabon. The Beti, including the Ewondo, moved south in the final wave and settled north of their Bulu and Fang relatives.

During this process, the migrants encountered other ethnic groups. The invaders were militarily superior, however, and (possibly aided by a reputation for Maka, who were living south of the Lom River but who fled south and east upon the Beti-Pahuin's arrival.

These migrations also coincided with the apex of European trade off the Cameroonian coast. The newly claimed jungle and near-coastal territories of the Beti-Pahuin allowed them to ensconce themselves into a lucrative role as middlemen; in exchange for European goods, they provided items such as slaves. After the establishment of a British naval presence in 1827 to hinder the West African slave trade, Beti-Pahuin merchants widened their operations to include such products as palm kernels and rubber (though slaves continued to be sold secretly).
