'''Charlie Hunter''' (* Rock- und Fusion-Berkeley (Kalifornien) auf, machte seinen Abschluss an der Berkeley High School und nahm Gitarrenstunden beim Gitarristen Joe Satriani.

Hunter ist bekannt für sein Spiel auf einer 8-saitigen Gitarre, die von Ralph Novak von Novax Guitars gebaut wurde. Er spielt gleichzeitig Lead-Gitarre auf den untersten 5 Saiten (gestimmt auf ADGHe) und Bass-Gitarre (gestimmt auf EAD) auf den oberen drei Saiten. Durch die Verwendung einer Hughes & Kettner Tube Rotosphere (Leslie rotary Lautsprecher-Simulator) erzeugt seine einzigartige Spielweise einen einer Hammond-Orgel ähnlichen Klang.

Hunter befürwortet eine uneingeschränkte Verbreitung seiner Live-Konzerte. Die Live-Veranstaltungen können als Aufzeichnungen über das Internet in digitaler Form von dem Internet Archiv aus San Francisco heruntergeladen werden.

Er spielte auch eine 7-saitige Gitarre in Michael Frantis politischer Hip-Hop-Gruppe The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy. Diese war 1992 eine Vorgruppe für U2s Zoo TV Tour.

Seit dem Debüt des 1993 selbsternannten Charlie Hunter Trio hat Hunter selbst 17 Alben aufgenommen. Während dieser Zeit hat er mit vielen Künstlern zusammengearbeitet wie z.B. Miles Perkins, Scott Amendola, Will Bernard, Skerik, Jay Lane, Dave Ellis, John Ellis, Mimi Fox, Peter Apfelbaum, Stefon Harris, Kurt Elling, Bobby Previte, Greg Osby, Chris Lovejoy, Leon Parker, Josh Roseman, John Santos, John Schott, D'angelo, Calder Spanier, Mos Def, Norah Jones, Adam Cruz, Phil deGruy, John Mayer and Willard Dyson.

'''Charlie Hunter''' (born May 23, 1967) is an American guitarist, composer and bandleader.

First coming to prominence in the early '90s Hunter has since become one of the leading names in solos. Critic Sean Westergaard<ref>http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:wzfyxqwsldje</ref> describes Hunter's innovative guitar technique as "mind-boggling ... he's an agile improviser with an ear for great tone, and always has excellent players alongside him in order to make great music, not to show off."

==Instruments and equipment==
Hunter plays a custom-made, eight-string Leslie rotary speaker simulator), his unique style produces a sound similar to that of a Hammond organ -- an instrument he set out to imitate.  

In 2006, Hunter removed the top guitar string and had the neck of his guitar reworked and now plays a modified 7-string on the formerly-8 string body. Hunter has mentioned that because of his small hands, he had to move out of position to make use of the 8th string and thus wasn't using it much. A change in Hunter's style away from the organ sound into a more blues and distortion based sound happened at the same time.  After removing the 8th string, Hunter retuned all of the strings up a half-step: F-Bflat-Eflat on the bass and Bflat-Eflat-Aflat-C on the guitar.
