The '''''Brockhaus Enzyklopädie''''' is a German-language encyclopedia published by Brockhaus. 

The first edition originated in the ''Conversations-Lexikon mit vorzüglicher Rücksicht auf die gegenwärtigen Zeiten'' by Renatus Gotthelf Löbel and Christian Wilhelm Franke, published in Leipzig 1796-1808.  Paralleling other 18th century encyclopedias, the scope was expanded beyond that of earlier publications, in an effort to become comprehensive.  This ''Lexikon'' included geography, history, and in part biography, as well as the more typical mythology, philosophy, natural history, and so on.

The current 21st edition contained about 300,000 entries on 24,000 pages, with about 35,000 maps, graphics and tables. It is the largest German language printed encyclopedia in the 21st century. In February 2008, Brockhaus said that they might never again publish a print edition.<ref name="NYT-16Mar08>Noam Cohen, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/weekinreview/16ncohen.html "Start Writing the Eulogies for Print Encyclopedias"], ''New York Times'', March 16, 2008</ref>

== History ==
In 1808, the rights to the publication were bought by thalers. Thirteen editions were issued during the 19th century. The articles, often very brief, were considered excellent and trustworthy, especially on German subjects, gave references to the best books, and included biographies of living men.

At first the name of the encyclopedia remained ''Konversationslexikon'' or ''Allgemeine deutsche Real-Encyklopädie für die gebildeten Stände''; only with the 13th edition did the name Brockhaus appear in the title, and the present edition is titled ''Brockhaus Enzyklopädie''.

Christian Wilhelm Franke was to finish vol. vi of the Leipzig publication by December 1808, and the already projected supplement, in 2 volumes, by 1811. Brockhaus himself edited the 2nd edition (1812-1819, 10 vols.), and, when vol. iv was published, the 3rd (1814-1819). Dr. Ludwig Ham assisted in editing the 4th and 5th editions until he left Leipzig in April 1820, when Professor F.C. Hasse took his place. Brockhaus died in 1823, and his two eldest sons, Friedrich and Heinrich, edited the 6th edition with Hasse's assistance in September 1823. Hasse edited the 7th edition. Dr. Karl August Espe edited the 8th and 9th editions.

Dr. August Kurtzel, aided by Oskar Pilz, edited the 10th edition, assisted by Heinrich Edward Brockhaus, and Heinrich Rudolf Brockhaus, the younger son, assisted in the 11th edition. Kurtzel died on April 24, 1871, and Pilz was sole editor until March 1872, when Dr. Gustav Stockmann joined, who was alone from April until joined by Dr. Karl Wippermann in October. 

On February 13, 2008, Brockhaus announced that it would switch its business, starting April 15, 2008, to the internet due to the disappointing sales figures of the 21st edition of the ''Brockhaus Enzyklopädie'', making the content of the encyclopedia available online. The company is looking to advertising internet advertising revenues to support the internet publishing.<ref></ref>
