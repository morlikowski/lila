'''Genesis''' ist das zwölfte Studioalbum der gleichnamigen Band und wurde im Oktober 1983 veröffentlicht. Mit diesem Album schaffte die Band endgültig den kommerziellen Durchbruch in Europa und den USA. Mit ''That’s All'', ''Mama'' und ''Illegal Alien'' sind drei sehr bekannte und erfolgreiche Single-Hits auf dem Album enthalten. Genesis erreichte den ersten Platz der britischen Album-Charts.

In Fankreisen ist das Album auch unter den Bezeichnungen ''Mama-Album'' (wegen des gleichnamigen Songs) oder ''Shapes-Album'' (wegen der Symbole auf dem Cover) bekannt. Neben erfolgreichen Hits enthielt das Album mit der Suite ''Home by the Sea / Second Home by the Sea'' auch einen „Longtrack“, der einige progressive Elemente und einen langen Instrumentalteil vorweist. Diese Suite ist vor allem bei Fans der Progressive Rock-Phase von Genesis in den 1970er-Jahren beliebt und war ein fester Bestandteil bei Konzerten der Band.

'''''Genesis''''' is an Genesis and is their twelfth studio album, recorded and released in 1983.  Most fans, as well as the band themselves, refer to this album as the "Mama" album.

Building on the advancements of ''Abacab'', ''Genesis'' (so named for the fact that all three band members composed every song on it together for the first time), was a further example of Genesis' evolution in the 1980s.  The album also marked the beginning of Hugh Padgham's formal production assistance after engineering ''Abacab''.

The Mama", was central to the song's atmosphere, and was responsible for further opening up songwriting possibilities within the band.  One of their most uncommercial releases, "Mama," a song about a young boy's obsession with a prostitute, became Genesis' biggest UK hit, reaching #4 upon release, although the song tanked on the US singles chart. 

Further successes "That's All" (which became the band's first US Top 10 hit), "Illegal Alien" and "Taking It All Too Hard" ensured that ''Genesis'' was well-received upon its release and it consequently reached UK # 1, while making #9 in the US and eventually selling over four million copies there alone. 

Among fans, the album has a generally favourable, yet still mixed reputation.

A SACD / DVD double disc set (including new 5.1 and Stereo mixes) was released in October 2007 in Europe and as a CD and DVD double disc set in the US and Canada a month later.

Longer versions of "Mama" and "It's Gonna Get Better" were recorded, but were not able to fit onto the album (which was released just before the dawn of the more-expansive compact disc), so the band released the longer, uncut versions of the two songs together on a 12-inch single in the UK. The full-length "Mama" features an extended ending, while the full-length "It's Gonna Get Better" contains an extra verse and a couple other performance bits. Surprisingly, the longer versions were not re-issued on the newly remastered CD/DVD edition of the album in 2007, and so, the rare 12-inch single remains a collector's item for fans.
