'''Hasil Adkins''' (pronounced "Hassle," not "Haysil") (country, rock and roll and blues musician, though he was frequently considered rockabilly and sometimes primitive jazz. He generally performed as a one-man band, playing guitar and drums at the same time and singing. Hasil was equally skilled on the harmonica and on keyboard.  

== Origin ==
Hasil was born in Boone County, West Virginia, where he lived his entire life. Although many sources list 1937 as his year of birth, Hasil's official Web site states that the year of his birth is actually unknown, citing "a missing family Bible" that lists his birth as "April 29, 193?". He was the youngest of 10 children, and was both severely depressive and hyperactive.  Growing up in a tarpaper shack on property rented from the local coal company, Hasil attended 6 days of school total and never really worked at anything other than being a musician.  He would occasionally repair various items such as cars or washing machines and turn them over for some income.  Hasil could fix just about anything he could lay his hands on.  Hasil's neighbor was Jesco White, a.k.a. the Dancin' Outlaw from Boone County -- an Elvis disciple who now openly acknowledges Hasil's influence.

== Musical career ==
Nicknamed "The Haze", Adkins claimed a repertoire of over 9,000 songs including over 7,000 original compositions, recorded scores of small, micro-label 45s, and is responsible for the birth of Norton Records, Psychobilly, and a dance called "The Hunch".

His music can be sad, humorous, and/or frantic. He was well known for shrieking certain catchphrases, such as "commodity meat", "I want your head", and "AaaaaaaaaaaaaHeeeeeeeeeeee-Wooo!!!!"

Recurring themes in Adkins' work include aliens, and Col. Harlan Sanders, the inventor of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

Some of his best known songs are "She Said," "No More Hot Dogs," "My Blue Star," "The Hunch," "Beautiful Hills," "We Got A Date,", "Chicken Walk", "Sally Weedy Waddy Woody Wally".

Adkins recorded an entire album devoted to chickens entitled ''Poultry in Motion'' also including such songs as "Chicken Run", "Chicken Hop", "Chicken Flop", "Chicken Wobble", and "Chicken On The Bone".

In addition to making many albums and CDs, Hasil Adkins also appeared in several movies and television shows with starring roles in "REST IN PIECES", "DIE YOU ZOMBIE BASTARDS", "GHOUL-A-GO-GO", "SLEAZEFEST", "LIVE & HUNCHAFIED", "DO YOU SEE ME LAUGHING" and most recently the Asia Argento film "THE HEART IS DECEITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS".
