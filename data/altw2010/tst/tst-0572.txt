השלט הרחוק הראשון בעולם הוצג על ידי חברת זנית ב-1950 נקרא Lazy Bones, ושימש לשליטה בטלוויזיה. השלט העביר פקודות בעזרת כבל.

בשנת האינפרה אדום ומונעים בעיה זו.

קיימות מספר שיטות לשידור:

1. שלט רחוק המשדר באולטרה סאונד (היה נפוץ בעבר).

2. שלט רחוק המשדר בתחום גלי הרדיו. (לדוגמה שלט של מכונית על שלט וטיסנים).

3. שלט רחוק הפועל בתחום האינפרה אדום, שהוא הנפוץ ביותר כיום. (לדוגמה, כמעט כל שלטי הטלוויזיה פועלים בתדרים אלו).

==איך השלט עובד?==
כאשר אנו לוחצים על כפתור בשלט אנו גורמים לסגירת המעגל החשמלי שמורכב מלוח הבינאריים שמקודדים על ידי הבדלים באורך האותות או הבדלים באורך הרווחים בין באותות או החלפת הסדר בין האותות לבין הרווחים. המרווחים תופסים כ-550 מילישניות או 1100 מילישניות כך שההליך של הקידוד על ידי השלט והפיענוח על ידי המכשיר המיועד נמשך כמובן שברירי שנייה. 

השלט פועל לרוב על ידי סוללות בגודל קטן (גודל של AA או AAA).

A '''remote control''' is an electronic device used for the remote operation of a machine.

The term remote control can be also referred to as "remote" or "controller" when abbreviated.  It is known by many other names as well.  Commonly, remote controls are stereo systems and radio signals. They are usually powered by small AAA or AA size batteries.

==History==
One of the earliest examples of remote control was developed in 1893 by his patent, , named ''Method of an Apparatus for Controlling Mechanism of Moving Vehicle or Vehicles''. 

In 1903, Leonardo Torres Quevedo presented the ''Telekino'' at the Paris Academy of Science, accompanied by a brief, and making an experimental demonstration. In the same year, he obtained a patent in France, Spain, Great Britain, and the United States. The ''Telekino'' consisted of a robot that executed commands transmitted by electromagnetic waves. It constituted the world's first apparatus for radio control and was a pioneer in the field of remote control. In 1906, in the presence of the king and before a great crowd, Torres successfully demonstrated the invention in the port of Bilbao, guiding a boat from the shore. Later, he would try to apply the ''Telekino'' to projectiles and torpedoes, but had to abandon the project for lack of financing.

The first remote-controlled model aeroplane flew in 1932, and the use of remote control technology for military purposes was worked intensively during the Second World War, one result of this being the German Wasserfall missile.

By the late 1930s, several radio manufacturers offered remote controls for some of their higher-end models. Most of these were connected to the set being controlled by wires, but the Philco Mystery Control (1939) was a battery-operated low-frequency radio transmitter <ref></ref>, thus making it the first wireless remote control for a consumer electronics device.

===Television Remote Controls===

The first remote intended to control a television was developed by Zenith Radio Corporation in 1950. The remote — officially called "Lazy Bones" was connected to the photoelectric cell. Unfortunately, the cells did not distinguish between light from the remote and light from other sources and the Flashmatic also required that the remote control be pointed very accurately at the receiver.<ref>{{cite web

In 1956 piezoelectric crystal that was fed by an oscillating electric current at a human hearing, though still audible to dogs. The receiver contained a microphone attached to a circuit that was tuned to the same frequency. Some problems with this method were that the receiver could be triggered accidentally by naturally occurring noises, and some people, especially young women, could hear the piercing ultrasonic signals. There was even a noted incident in which a toy xylophone changed the channels on these types of TVs since some of the overtones from the xylophone matched the remote's ultrasonic frequency.

The impetus for a more complex type of television remote control came in the late 1970s with the development of the Ceefax teletext service by the BBC. Most commercial remote controls at that time had a limited number of functions, sometimes as few as three: next channel, previous channel, and volume/off.  This type of control did not meet the needs of teletext sets where pages were identified with three-digit numbers. A remote control to select teletext pages would need buttons for each number from zero to nine, as well as other control functions, such as switching from text to picture, and the normal television controls of volume, station, brightness, colour intensity and so on. Early teletext sets used wired remote controls to select pages but the continuous use of the remote control required for teletext quickly indicated the need for a wireless device. So BBC engineers began talks with one or two television manufacturers which led to early prototypes in around 1977-78 that could control a much larger number of functions. ITT was one of the companies and later gave its name to the ITT protocol of infrared communication. <ref></ref>

===Social Effects of the Early Television Remote Control===

In the 1950’s  remotes were extra upgrades options to T.V. sets. As previously mentioned, Zenith was ready to change the lives of "lazy" people for good.<ref>http://www.zenith.com/sub_about/about_remote.html, About Zenith</ref> The initial purpose to the T.V. remote was to turn off the T.V. set from afar, and to change the channels or mute commercials. People were told that the remote could turn off the T.V. while they were still laying in their LaZBoy and thus could drift off to sleep without interruption. A common complaint was that people tripped on the cable that was attached to the first remotes. It was not until 1955 that Zenith created the “Flash-matic” or their first wireless remote. While it helped keep the flow of traffic without tripping people along the way, the “Flash-matic” was not flawless. It frustrated people when the sun would hit the T.V. set, thus changing the channel.

The remote gave viewers an opportunity to “arm” themselves. Viewers no longer watched a show because they did not want to get up to turn the channel. <ref>http://inventors.about.com/od/rstartinventions/a/remote_control.htm, The History of the Television Remote Control</ref>

Audiences were “armed” with the ability to change their minds about what they were watching. It allowed audiences, for the first time, to interact with their T.V.. The remote’s technology and buzz started something the first of its kind for the everyday T.V. viewer: the Joystick.<ref>Rushkoff, Douglas: "Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative", page 25. Living in the Information Age, 2005.</ref> The Joystick allowed people to interact with their T.V., liberating the kinds of interaction they had with their television. Pong- the game in which people first used joysticks- was a basic game that was based on ping-pong. This new technology gave the average T.V. owner the ability to manipulate his or her own pixel on the T.V. screen for the first time.<ref>Kent, Steven L: "the Ultimate history of Video Games: From Pong to Pokemon--the Story behind the Craze That Touched Our Lives and Changed the World, page 27, 2001</ref>

The invention of the remote control has led to several different changes in television programming.  One thing that the remote control led to was the creation of split screen credits.  According to James Gleick, an NBC research team discovered that when the credits started rolling after a program, 25% of its viewers would change the channel before it was over.  Because of this, the NBC 2000 unit invented the “squeeze and tease” which squeezed the credits onto one third of the screen while the final minutes of the broadcast aired simultaneously.<ref>Gleick, James: "Prest-O! Change-O!", page 147. Living in the Information Age, 2005.</ref>

The remote control also led to an adjustment in commercial airings.  Networks began to feel that they could not afford to have commercials between programs because it would detract viewers from staying tuned in on their channel. Programmers decided to place commercials in the middle of programs in order to transition into the next show directly.<ref>Gleick, James: "Prest-O! Change-O!", page 148. Living in the Information Age, 2005.</ref>

With networks keeping in mind that people were equipped with remotes, thirty-second advertisement spots were cut down into segments of eight seconds or less. MTV was made up of this high-speed and broken cutting style, which aired music videos that were around three-minutes and each shot no more than two or three seconds. But MTV felt that even these three-minute segments were too long, so they created an animated series called ''Beavis and Butthead'', to keep their viewer’s attention. <ref>Gleick, James: "Prest-O! Change-O!", page 149. Living in the Information Age, 2005.</ref> In the show, they would show segments of music videos and then switch back to the characters and offer dialogue and action while the music video played in the background. <ref>http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/b/htmlb/beavisandbu.htm, Museum of Broadcast Communications: Beavis and Butthead.</ref> ''Beavis and Butthead'' was purposefully stagnant, with slow dialogue and depending on reaction shots, but animation takes the most management and the pacing is everything. The last fraction of a second of sound track overlaid with the first fraction of a second of the visual track for the next scene.<ref>Gleick, James: "Prest-O! Change-O!", page 150. Living in the Information Age, 2005.</ref>

===Other Remote Controls===

In the 1980s Apple, started a company named CL 9. The purpose of this company was to create a remote control which could operate multiple electronic devices. The CORE unit as it was named (Controller Of Remote Equipment) was introduced in the fall of 1987. The advantage to this remote controller was that it could “learn” remote signals from other different devices. It also had the ability to perform specific or multiple functions at various times with its built in clock. It was also the first remote control which could be linked to a computer and loaded with updated software code as needed. The CORE unit never made a huge impact of the market. It was much too cumbersome for the average user to program, but it received rave reviews from those who could figure out how to program it. These obstacles eventually lead to the demise of CL 9, but one of its employees continued the business under the name Celadon. This was one of the first computer controlled learning remote controls on the market. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celadon.com/Profile/Profile.html|title=Celadon Remote Control Systems

By the early 2000s, the number of consumer electronic devices in most homes greatly increased, along with the number of remotes to control those devices. According to the TV and audio amplifier. Several of these remotes may need to be used sequentially, but, as there are no accepted interface guidelines, the process is increasingly cumbersome. Many specialists, including Jakob Nielsen <ref></ref>, a renowned usability specialist and Robert Adler, <!-- http://www.membrana.ru/articles/simply/2004/07/07/220900.html it's in Russian --> the inventor of the modern remote, note how confusing, unwieldy and frustrating the multiplying remotes have become.

==Technique==

thumb|250px|The emission spectrum of a typical sound system remote control is in the near infrared.

thumb|250px|The modulation of the IR diode varies by button.

Most control remotes for electronic appliances use a near diode to emit a beam of light that reaches the device. A 940 nm wavelength LED is typical. This infrared light is invisible to the human eye but carries signals that are detected by the appliance, as well as by the sensor of a digital camera.

With a single channel (single-function, one-button) remote control the presence of a carrier signal can be used to trigger a function. For multi-channel (normal multi-function) remote controls more sophisticated procedures are necessary: one consists of modulating the carrier with signals of different frequency. After the demodulation of the received signal, the appropriate frequency filters are applied to separate the respective signals. Nowadays digital procedures are more commonly used.  One can often hear the signals being modulated on the infrared carrier by operating a remote control in very close proximity to an AM radio not tuned to a station.

Some remotes use radio frequency signals.

==Usage==
===Industry===
Remote control is used for controlling substations, pump storage power stations and HVDC-plants. For these systems often PLC-systems working in the longwave range are used.
