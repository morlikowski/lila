'''Mekhilta''' or  '''Mekilta''' (Scriptural comments and explanations of the Law which it contains are based on fixed rules of Scriptural exegesis ("middot"; comp. Talmudical Hermeneutics). The halakic midrashim are in general called "middot," in contrast to the "halakot," or formulated laws; and an interpreter of the Midrash was termed "bar mekilan" = "a man of the rules" (Lev. R. iii.).

==First Mention==
Neither the Babylonian Talmud nor the Jerusalem Talmud mentions this work under the name "Mekhilta," nor does the word occur in any of the passages of the Talmud in which the other halakic midrashim, Sifra and Sifre, are named (Ḥag. 3a; Ḳid. 49b; Ber. 47b; etc.). It seems to be intended, however, in one passage (Yer. Ab. Zarah iv. 8), which runs as follows: "R. Josiah showed a Mekhilta from which he cited and explained a sentence." His quotation actually occurs in the Mekhilta, "Mishpaṭim" (ed. I.H. Weiss, p. 106b). It is not certain, however, whether the word "Mekhilta" here refers to the work under consideration; for it possibly alludes to a baraita collection—which might also be designated a "Mekhilta" (comp. Pes. 48a; Tem. 33a; Giṭ. 44a)—containing the sentence in question. 

On the other hand, this midrash, apparently in written form, is mentioned several times in the Talmud under the title "She'ar Sifre debe Rab" = "The Other Books of the Schoolhouse" (Yoma 74a; B. B. 124b). A geonic responsum (A. Harkavy, ''Teshubot ha-Geonim,'' p. 31, No. 66, Berlin, 1888) in which occurs a passage from the Mekhilta (ed. I.H. Weiss, p. 41a) likewise indicates that this work was known as "She'ar Sifre debe Rab." The first person to mention the Mekhilta by name was the author of the ''Halakot Gedolot'' (p. 144a, ed. Warsaw, 1874). Another geonic responsum refers to it as the "Mekhilta de-Ereẓ Yisrael" (A. Harkavy, l.c. p. 107, No. 229), probably to distinguish it from the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon, which was generally known in the Babylonian schools (D. Hoffmann, ''Zur Einleitung in die Halachischen Midraschim,'' p. 36).

==Mekhilta of R. Ishmael==<!-- This section is linked from Midrash -->

The author, or more correctly the redactor, of the Mekhilta can not be definitely ascertained. R. Akiba also wrote a Mekhilta." This R. Ishmael, however, is neither an amora by the name of Ishmael, as Z. Frankel assumed (''Introduction to Yerushalmi'', p. 105b), nor Rebbi's contemporary, Rabbi Ishmael ben Jose, as Gedaliah ibn Yaḥya thought (''Shalshelet ha-Ḳabbalah,'' p. 24a, Zolkiev, 1804). He is, on the contrary, identical with R. Ishmael ben Elisha, R. Akiba's contemporary, as is shown by the passage of Maimonides quoted above. 

The present Mekhilta cannot, however, be the one composed by R. Ishmael, as is proved by the references in it to R. Ishmael's pupils and to other later Hoffmann, l.c. p. 73). 

A later editor, intending to compile a Law (Friedmann, l.c. p. 72; Hoffmann, l.c. p. 37). He even omitted passages from the portion which he took, but, by way of compensation, he incorporated much material from the other halakic midrashim, Sifra, R. Shimon bar Yochai's Mekilta, and the Sifre to Deuteronomy. Since the last two works were from a different source, he generally designated them by the introductory phrase, "dabar aḥer" = "another explanation," placing them after the sections taken from R. Ishmael's midrash. But the redactor based his work on the midrash of R. Ishmael's school, and the sentences of R. Ishmael and his pupils constitute the larger part of his Mekhilta.  Similarly, most of the anonymous maxims in the work were derived from the same source, so that it also was known as the "Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael."  The redactor must have been a pupil of Rebbi, since the latter is frequently mentioned (comp. Abraham ibn Daud in ''Sefer HaKabbalah'' in A. Neubauer, ''M. J. C.'', p.57, Oxford, 1887, who likewise ascribes it to a pupil of Rebbi).

He cannot, however, have been R. Hoshaiah, as A. Epstein assumes (''Beiträge zur Jüdischen Alterthumskunde,'' p.55, Vienna, 1887), as might be inferred from Abraham ibn Daud's reference, for Hoshaiah is mentioned in the Mekhilta (ed. Weiss, p.60b).  Abba Arika (Rab) therefore probably redacted the work, as Menahem ibn Zerah says in the preface to ''Zedah la-Derek'' (p.14b). Rab, however, did not do this in Babylonia, as I.H. Weiss assumes (''Einleitung in die Mechilta'', p.19), but in Palestine, taking it after its compilation to Babylonia, so that it was called "Mekhilta de-Eretz Yisrael".)

==Quotations in the Talmud==
Baraitot from the Mekhilta are introduced in the Babylonian Talmud by the phrases "Tana debe R. Yishmael" = "It was taught in the school of R. Ishmael," and in the Jerusalem Talmud  and the haggadic midrashim by "Teni R. Yishmael" = "R. Ishmael taught".  Yet there are many baraitot in the Talmud which contain comments on Book of Exodus, and which are introduced by the phrase    "Tana debe R. Yishmael," but which are not included in the Mekhilta under discussion.  These must have been included in  R. Ishmael's original Mekhilta, and the fact that they are omitted in this midrash is evidence that its redactor excluded many of the passages from R. Ishmael's work (comp. D. Hoffman, l.c. p.42).

== Structure ==
The Mekhilta begins with Ex. xii, this being the first leagal section found in Exodus.  That this is the beginning of the Mekhilta is shown by the ''Aruk'' s.v. טמא, and by the ''Seder Tannaim v'Amoraim'' (ed. S.D. Luzzatto, p.12, Prague 1839).  In like manner R. Nissim proves in his ''Mafteach'' (to Shab. 106b) that the conclusion of the Mekhilta which he knew corresponded with that of the Mekhilta now extant.  In printed editions the Mekhilta is divided into nine "massektot," each of which is further subdivided into "parshiyyot".  The nine massektot are as follows:

# "Massekta de-Pesha", covering the pericope "Bo" (quoted as "Bo"), Ex. xii.1–xiii.16, and containing an introduction, "petikta," and 18 sections.
# "Massekta de-Vayehi Beshallah," (quoted as "Besh."), ib.,  xiii.17–xiv.31, containing an introduction and 6 sections.
# "Massekta de-Shirah," (quoted as "Shir"), ib.,  xv.1–21, containing 10 sections.
# "Massekta de-Vayassah," (quoted as "Vay."), ib.,  xv.22–xvii.7, containing 6 sections.
# "Massekta de-Amalek", consisting of two parts:
## the part dealing with Amalek (quoted as "Am."), ib.,  xvii.8–16, containing 2 sections.
## the beginning of the pericope "Yitro" (quoted as "Yitro"), ib.,  xviii.1–27, containing 2 sections.
#"Massekta de-Bahodesh," (quoted as "Bah."), ib.,  xix.1–20, 26, containing 11 sections.
#"Massekta de-Nezikin," ib.,  xxi.1–xxii.23.  (see next)
#"Massekta de-Kaspa,"  ib.,  xxii.24–xxiii.19; these last two messektot, which belong to the pericope "Mishpatim" contain 20 sections consecutively numbered, and are quoted as "Mish." 
# "Massekta de-Shabbeta", containing 2 sections:
## covering the pericope "Ki Tissa" (quoted as "Ki"), ib.,  xxxi.12–17
## covering the pericope "Vayakhel" (quoted as "Vayak"), ib.,  xxxv.1–3

Die '''Mechilta''' (aram. מכילתא) ist ein halachischer hebr. ''Sefer Schemot''). Als Redaktor wird Rabbi Jischmael ben Elischa angegeben.
Die Mechilta zählt zu den Hauptwerken des halachischen Midrasch. In Wirklichkeit aber enthält sie mehr aggadische als halachische Bestandteile.

Das Wort ''Mechilta'' („Auslegungsnorm“) kommt aus dem Aramäischen und bedeutet soviel wie das hebräische ''Midda'' (מדה „Maß“, „Norm“).

Die Mechilta beginnt mit dem 12. Kapitel des Exodus und reicht bis zum Schluss der Hauptgesetze des Exodus (23,19; Nachtrag zu 31,12–17; 34,1–3); sie ist in 9 Abschnitte mit 79 Kapiteln gegliedert.

Daneben gibt es noch die Mechilta des Rabbi Simon ben Jochaj, später auch "Mechiltin Akiba" genannt (selten: mekhilta de sanija). Sie wurde von Nachmanides und überhaupt im Mittelalter oft zitiert (bis ins 16. Jhdt.), aber es gab keine geschlossene Buchform von ihr, und sie galt deshalb als verloren (kritische Ausgabe später entdeckter Geniza-Fragmente herausgegeben durch E. Z. Melamed, Jerusalem 1955, basierend auf Vorarbeiten von J. N. Epstein).
