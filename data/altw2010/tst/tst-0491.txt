'''内华达级战列舰'''是美国建造的一种战列舰。

内华达级战列舰采用了当时颇具争议的被称为“'''All or Nothing Armor Scheme'''”的装甲防护设计（称为“重点防护”），因为美国海军认为战列舰传统防护体系的中等厚度装甲无法防御无畏型战列舰不断加大口径的主炮穿甲弹。这是美国海军战列舰防护设计上的重大革新。其主要设计特点是，战舰的非重要部位减少或没有装甲防护，而重要部位（主炮塔、轮机舱、指挥塔等要害部位）则得到最大限度的装甲防护。其设计思想被其他各国海军所借鉴。安装10门14英寸口径主炮，双联装和三联装主炮炮塔各两座，采用艏艉对称的布置形式。
同级舰两艘，首舰内华达号(BB36)俄克拉荷马号(BB37)。

偷袭珍珠港，俄克拉荷马号至少承受了5条鱼雷的打击，致使该舰倾覆沉没。而内华达号是港中唯一得以开动的战列舰，企图驶出港口，在日军第二波进攻中成为主要目标，为避免在港口出口沉没抢滩搁浅。其后在西海岸进行现代化改装，改建上层建筑，撤去全部旧式副炮，改装高平双用炮。战争中内华达号往来于太平洋和欧洲战区之间，参加了诺曼底战役、硫磺岛战役和冲绳岛战役。战争结束后，内华达号1946年参与比基尼岛原子弹的试验。1948年7月作为靶船被击沉。

The '''''Nevada'' class battleships''' were the ''Colorado'' class would be the last to carry twin turrets, armed with dual-mounted 16" guns), as well as introducing the so-called "all or nothing" armor scheme, in which protection of vital areas was optimized against heavy caliber guns, leaving other parts of the ship essentially unprotected.

==Design==
The ''Nevada'' class was part of the ''Pennsylvania'', ''New Mexico'', ''Tennessee'' and ''Colorado'' classes.

===Armor Suite===
The armor suite was designed by a confluence of design choices rather than an overall scheme.  As early as the all or nothing” where heavy armor would cover what was vital and no armor anywhere else at all. Gunnery tests against the target ship USS ''San Marcos'' (ex ) confirmed the need for a better armor suite. <ref>[http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/battleships/us_dr.htm#nev-cl World Battleships List: US Dreadnought Battleships<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Turret faces were thickened to 18”.  This jump in armor protection should not be under estimated, as both sides of the Battle of Jutland would find out as turret roofs were pierced over and over.<ref>Friedman, Norman:U.S. Battleships an illustrated design history ISBN 0-87021-715-1 P107, P111</ref>

===Armament=== 
The 14” naval gun was carried over from the  however triple turrets were introduced for the lower fore and aft pair positions removing the amidships turret that the General Board found “disgusting”.<ref>Friedman, Norman:U.S. Battleships an illustrated design history ISBN 0-87021-715-1 P111</ref>  Problems with heating of the amidships magazine by high pressure steam lines and lack of clear fire arcs were deemed unacceptable.  By using a 3,2,2,3 turret scheme all the main guns could be moved out to the ends of the ship for better arcs of fire and away from machinery spaces.  This move would allow armor to be much heavier than the preceding class New York class battleship.  While the primary armament was a success the same would not be said of the secondary armament.  The fore and aft most positions were found to be so wet as to cause the positions to be removed and plated over, the 5"/51 having to be moved to the main deck and 01 deck.

===Engineering===
These were also the Navy's first to have oil as their primary fuel and the last to use twin-screw propulsion (all subsequent battleships would use four screws).  The Nevada marked the switch to the use of oil from coal as a fuel.  Oil boasted greater thermal efficiency, allowing greater range per ton of fuel carried.  The switch from coal also allowed the use of smaller boilers conserving weight and space on the Nevada class battleships.<ref>Friedman, Norman: U.S. Battleships, an illustrated design ISBN 0-87021-715-1 P105</ref> ''Oklahoma'' represented the final use of reciprocating machinery.  ''Oklahoma''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Vertical Triple Expansion (VTE) engine equipment made her clankier, less reliable and more vibration-prone than her sister, making her a ship the Navy wished to re-engine.
