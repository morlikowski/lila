==Story==

The story is set in the "Dark Ages", a term referring to the time since Vandels appeared and started attacking humans. Beet is a boy who dreams of joining the "Zenon Warriors", a group of "Vandel Busters" who are considered to be the strongest on the continent. When the group comes to protect his village from the Vandel, Beltorze, Beet tries to join them but is rejected.

When Beltorze appears, the Zenon Warriors seem to have the upper hand until Beet cheers them on, causing the Vandel to notice his presence. Beltorze attacks Beet so the Zenon Warriors to drop formation to help him. Beltorze uses that moment to attack again, which mortally wounds all of them. Hidden in the smoke, the Zenon Warriors decide to rescue Beet’s life by putting their life force into their “Saiga” and giving them to Beet. When Beet complains and asks them why they are doing this, it is revealed that Zenon is Beet’s brother. The now weaponless Zenon Warriors then emerge from the smoke and continue to attack Beltorze. When Beet regains consciousness, both Beltorze and the Zenon Warriors are gone. Guilt ridden and sad, he cries and vows to destroy all the Vandels and end the Dark Ages. He then goes on a three-year training expedition.

His childhood friend, Poala, who Beet keeps impressing that she is going to marry Beet, later joins Beet and they form the “Beet Warriors”. As the story continues more is learned about the fight between the Zenon Warriors and Beltorze and the fantasy world of Beet is expanded on.

The manga series has been on hiatus since September 2006.

 è uno shonen manga scritto da Riku Sanjo e illustrato da Koji Inada già autori del famoso manga Dai - La grande avventura. Di stampo fantasy come "Dai", "Beet" ha riscosso un forte successo in Giappone, tanto che ne sono usciti fuori una serie a cartoni animati e numerosi videogiochi. 

== Trama ==

La storia, come gia enunciato, si svolge in un mondo fantasy, durante l'Era delle Tenebre. i Vandel (il cui nome deriva dall'unione di "vampire" e "devil"), perfidi demoni, fanno proliferare in continuazione la Terra di mostri. Per cambiare la situazione è nata un'apposita professione, ovvero i Vandel Buster, si dice che la loro origine sia quella dei cacciatori di taglie. Spesso questi cacciatori vengono chiamati soltanto Buster. Ognuno di loro ha una diversa tecnica di combattimento e si guadagnano da vivere uccidendo Vandel e Mostri (creati dai Vandel) in cambio di damaro. I Buster hanno fondato una grande e organizzata corporazione. Il protagonista della nostra storia è Beet, un umano che per seguire le orme della Squadra di Zenon (nota squadra di buster), con a capo quello che scoprira' poi essere suo fratelo, diventa un Vandel Buster ed insieme alla sua sorella adottiva Poala, anche lei divenuta Buster, intraprende un lungo viaggio per debellare il mondo dai Vandel. 

L'equipaggiamento è composto da una buster jacket (che si puo' ritirare in ogni House non appena raggiunto il decimo livello), un branding o "marchiatura", (simbolo impresso sul petto del Buster al momento della stipulazione del contratto), un'ander jucket, armi da mano particolarmente care al Buster, e, soprattutto una Saiga (l'arma estrema che solo pochi Buster sanno usare, nei momenti più cruciali).
