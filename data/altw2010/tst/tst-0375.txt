'''Duca''', dal latino ''dux'' (dal verbo ''ducere'', condurre, da cui anche le parole duce e doge), è un titolo di origine militare, poi designante un potere politico ed, infine, titolo nobiliare che è compreso tra quello di marchese e quello di granduca.

Le insegne del titolo sono la corona cimata da 8 fioroni d'oro dei quali cinque visibili (uso italiano), l'elmo d'oro arabescato, posto di fronte, semiaperto, e il manto di velluto porpora.

Il termine ''dux'' indicava nell'province, passò a designare i capi delle truppe di una provincia.

Verso la metà del VII secolo vennero a concentrarsi nelle mani dei ''duces'' oltre ai poteri militari anche quelli giudiziari e civili.
Venivano ora investiti della carica, oltre che dall'Impero Bizantino, anche dai vari Regni latino-germanici. Famosi erano i duchi Longobardi.
Con l'affievolirsi del potere centrale il titolo di duca fu dato a principi che, di fatto, erano sovrani nei loro possedimenti (vedi per esempio: il ducato di Spoleto ed il ducato di Benevento).

Il granduca è un titolo nobiliare che indica un duca con dignità superiore al Duca e al  principe.

Il titolo di ''duca'' in Sicilia e nell'Italia meridionale era inferiore al titolo di ''principe'', mentre nell'Italia del nord il titolo ''ducale'' era superiore a quello ''principesco''.
Nel Regno d'Italia entrambi titoli furono collocati sullo stesso livello, cioè avevano la stessa importanza. 

Mentre per i titoli sovrani cioè che rientrano nel ruolo principesco si ha la seguente gerarchia: ''granduca'', ''duca'', ''principe'', ''marchese'', ''conte''.

== Diritto ==
La Repubblica Italiana non riconosce i titoli nobiliari e, con l'entrata in vigore della Costituzione italiana nel 1948, ha abrogato la regolamentazione della Consulta araldica, e pertanto il titolo di duca, come gli altri titoli nobiliari, non ha effetti civili. Va detto che la situazione attuale, sotto il profilo giuridico, trova sistemazione e regolamentazione, dopo l'entrata in vigore della Costituzione italiana, nella esistenza di un'associazione privata, il "Corpo della Nobiltà Italiana" che rivendica una continuità ideale con la Consulta araldica.

A '''duke''' is a noble person, historically of highest rank below the Latin ''Roman authors covering them to refer to their war leaders. 

In the Germanic monarchies.  Dukes were the rulers of the provinces and the superiors of the counts in the cities and later, in the feudal monarchies, the highest-ranking peers of the king. There were, however, variants of these meanings and there were even sovereign princes employing ducal titles. 

In the peerage in France, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy. 

A woman who holds in her own right the title to such duchy or dukedom, or is the wife of a duke, is normally styled '''duchess'''. However, Queen Elizabeth II is known as Duke of Normandy in the Channel Islands and Duke of Lancaster in Lancashire.

== History ==
=== Roman Empire ===

Originally, ''dux'' was a title given to a leader of a single military expedition or army, who held no power other than that which he exercised over his soldiers. The designation, first applied to barbarian tribal leaders, became a formal Roman title in the provinces; this Roman rank was below the similar ''Artorius Dux Bellorum''<ref>[http://cygnata.sandwich.net/writings/arthur.html Artorius Dux Bellorum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> rather than translate the title to ''duke''.

=== Middle Ages ===
During the Middle Ages following the collapse of Roman power in Western Europe, the title was still employed in the Germanic kingdoms, most often to the rulers of the old Roman provinces. 

==== Visigoths ====
The Visigoths retained the Roman divisions of their kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula and it seems that dukes ruled over these areas. They were the highest magnates in the land and, along with the bishops, elected the king, usually from their own file. They were the military commanders and in this capacity often acted independently of the king, most notably in the last days of the kingdom.

The army was structured decimally with the highest unit, the thiufa, probably corresponding to about one thousand people from each ''civitas'', city district. The cities were commanded by the counts, who were in turn responsible to the dukes, who called up the ''thiufae'' when need be.

==== Lombards ====
When the Lombards entered Italy, the Latin chroniclers called their war leaders ''duces'' in the old fashion. These leaders eventually became the provincial rulers, each with a recognized seat of government. Though nominally loyal to the king, the concept of kingship was new to the Lombards and the dukes were highly independent, especially in central and southern Italy, where the Duke of Spoleto and the Duke of Benevento were ''de facto'' sovereigns. In 575, when Cleph died, a period known as the Rule of the Dukes, in which the dukes governed without a king, commenced. It lasted only a decade before the disunited magnates, in order to defend the kingdom from external attacks, elected a new king and even diminished their own duchies to provide him with a handsome royal demesne. 

The Lombard kings were usually drawn from the dukes when the title was not hereditary. The dukes tried to make their own offices hereditary. Beneath them in the internal structure were the counts and gastalds, a uniquely Lombard title initially referring to judicial functions, similar to a count's, in provincial regions.

==== Franks ====
The Franks employed dukes as the governors of Roman provinces, though they also led military expeditions far away from their duchies. The dukes were the highest ranking officials in the realm, were more typically Franks than the counts (who were often Gallo-Romans), and formed the class from which the kings' generals were drawn in times of war. The dukes gathered every May with the king to converse on policy for the upcoming year, the so-called Mayfield. 

In Burgundy and Provence, the titles of patrician and prefect were commonly employed in preference to duke, probably for historical reasons relating to the greater Romanization of those provinces. The titles, however, were basically equivalent. 

In late ''dux et princeps Francorum'': "duke and prince of the Franks." In this title, "duke" implied supreme military control of the entire nation (''Francorum'', the Franks) and it was thus used until the end of the Carolingian dynasty in France in 987.

==== England ====
===== Anglo-Saxon times =====

The highest political division beneath that of kingdom among the Danish ''eorl'' (later earl) over time, the first ealdor people were referred to as ''duces'' in the chronicles. Thus, in Anglo-Saxon England, where the Roman political divisions were largely abandoned, the grade of duke was retained as supreme territorial magnate after the king.

===== Late medieval times =====
The Black Prince was created Duke of Cornwall in 1337. He was the first proper Duke to be created by a King of England. To celebrate this event six new Earls were created. In the Patent creating the new Earl of Salisbury, on 16 March 1337, the King refers also to this higher Honour as: ''"willing more securely to establish the Royal sceptre as well as by the addition of new honours as by the restoration of old ones, and to augment the number of nobles by whose counsels our realm may be directed in doubtful, and by whose suffrages be supported in adverse circumstances, have advanced our most dear first begotten Edward (whom in the prerogative of honour as is meet, we have caused to have precedence of others) to be Duke of Cornwall, over which awhile ago Dukes for a long time successively sided as chief rulers..."''

=== The Modern Age ===
In the 19th century, the sovereign dukes of Parma and Nassau, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen and Saxe-Altenburg in Germany survived Napoleon's reorganization.

Since the unification of Italy in grand duke, a higher title, just below King.    

In the United Kingdom, the inherited position of a duke along with its dignities, privileges, and rights is a dukedom. However, the title of ''duke'' has never been associated with independent rule in the British Isles: they hold dukedoms, not duchies (but see Duchy of Cornwall and Duchy of Lancaster). Dukes in the United Kingdom are addressed as 'Your Grace' and referred to as 'His Grace'. Currently, there are twenty-seven dukedoms in the Peerage of England, Peerage of Scotland, Peerage of Great Britain, Peerage of Ireland and Peerage of the United Kingdom, held by twenty-four different people (see List of Dukes in order of precedence).

== Equivalents in other European languages ==

== Royal dukes ==
Various royal houses traditionally awarded (mainly) dukedoms to the sons and in some cases, the daughters, of their respective Sovereigns; others include at least one dukedom in a wider list of similarly granted titles, nominal dukedoms without any actual authority, often even without an estate. Such titles are still conferred on royal princes or princesses in the current European monarchies of Belgium, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

Other historical cases occurred for example in Denmark, Finland (as Sweden, in personal union) and France, Portugal and some former colonial possessions such as Brazil and Haiti.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, ducal titles which have been given within the royal family include Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence, Duke of York, Duke of Gloucester, Duke of Bedford, Duke of Cumberland, Duke of Cambridge, Duke of Rothesay, Duke of Albany, Duke of Ross, Duke of Edinburgh, Duke of Kent, Duke of Sussex, and Duke of Connaught and Strathearn.

=== Belgium ===
In Belgium, the title of Duke of Brabant (historically the most prestigious in the Low Countries, and containing the federal capital Brussels), if still vacant, has been awarded preferentially to the eldest son and heir presumptive of the King, other male dynasts receiving various lower historical titles (much older than Belgium, and in principle never fallen to the Belgian crown), such as Count of Flanders (king Leopold III's so-titled brother held the title when he became the realm's temporary head of state as Prince-regent) and Prince of Liège (a secularised version of the historical Prince-bishopric; e.g. the present king Albert II until he succeeded his older brother Baudouin I)

=== Denmark ===
Denmark's kings gave appanages in their twin-duchies of Schleswig-Holstein (now three-fourths of them is part of Germany, but then the Holstein half of it was part of HRE in personal union with Denmark proper) to younger sons and/or their male-line descendants, with a specific though not sovereign title of Duke, e.g. Duke of Gottorp, Duke of Sonderburg, Duke of Augustenborg, Duke of Franzhagen, Duke of Beck, Duke of Glucksburg and Duke of Norburg.

=== Iberian peninsula ===
When the Caliphate of Cordoba and its taifa-remnants, transformed the territory of former Suevic and Visigothic realms into Catholic feudal principalities, none of these war lords was exactly styled Duke, a few (as itself) started as King. 

==== Portugal ====

==== Spain ====

Spanish HRH the Duchess of Badajoz (Infanta Maria del Pilar), HRH the Duchess of Soria (Infanta Margarita) (although she inherited the title of Duchess of Hernani from her cousin and is second holder of that title), HRH the Duchess of Lugo (Infanta Elena) and HRH the Duchess of Palma de Mallorca (Infanta Cristina).

In Spain many dukes hold the court rank of ''Grande'', i.e. Grandee of the realm, which had precedence over all other feudatories.
