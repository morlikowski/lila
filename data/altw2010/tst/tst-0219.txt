'''''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''''' is a 2005 novel of the same name, and is the fourth film in the popular ''Harry Potter film series''.

Directed by Mike Newell, the film concerns Harry Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hogwarts has been selected to hold the recently returning wizard competition known as the Triwizard Tournament. Though Harry does not apply, the Goblet of Fire mysteriously selects him as a second representative of Hogwarts in the tournament.

Three days after its release, the film had grossed over US$102 million at the 11th highest-grossing film of all time. The DVD went on to become the fastest selling DVD of all time. It is currently the third-highest grossing ''Harry Potter'' film, behind  ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' and ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''.

The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Memoirs of a Geisha''.

This was also the first ''Harry Potter'' film to receive a "12a" in the UK and  "PG-13" rating in the US or its international equivalents (for sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images), the preceding films having been rated PG or its international equivalents.

== Plot ==

Harry Potter, The Burrow before departing with the Weasley family and Hermione for the Quidditch World Cup. After the introduction to the game, there is a temporal jump to that evening, when the camp is attacked by Death Eaters, who disperse when the Dark Mark is shot into the air by an unknown man.

Harry, Ron and Hermione arrive at Hogwarts, where they find that the school will be hosting the Dumbledore reveals the Goblet of Fire, a magical cup into which potential champions must drop a piece of parchment with their name on it. The goblet acts as an impartial judge to select candidates and reveals its results by shooting the relevant pieces of parchment into the air: Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. The goblet then unexpectedly announces a fourth champion, Harry, although he did not enter his name and is in any case under the age limit set by the Defence against the Dark Arts professor, Alastor Moody, to keep an eye on Harry.

In the first Triwizard task, the four champions each battle a summoning charm to bring his broom into the arena, but the dragon breaks free of its chains and chases Harry through the Hogwarts grounds. Harry retrieves the egg, which is said to contain a clue about the second task, though only a horrible screeching emerges when he opens his egg. Cedric Diggory, the other Hogwarts champion, advises Harry to open the egg underwater. Harry does so in the prefects' bathroom and hears the clue clearly; it informs him that the merpeople will take something of Harry's and that he must retrieve it from the lake in the Hogwarts grounds.

In the second Triwizard task, each champion must find and save someone close to them who is now chained underwater.  Harry swallows Gillyweed which allows him to breath underwater, then begins searching for the merpeople village.  While following he mermaid, he sees Fleur attacked by Grindylows.  This forces her to withdraw from the task.  When Harry arrives at the merpeoples' village, he sees Ron, Hermione, Cho Chang, and Gabrielle Delacour catatonic and chained to a rock with thousands of merpeople guarding them.  Harry cuts Ron free, hesitates, and then moves to cut free Gabrielle realizing that Fleur will not be able to save her sister.  When he does, the merpeople threaten him with their spears with one mermaid poking her spear into Harry's throat.  He is saved when Viktor, in the shape of a half-man/half-shark swims by to break free Hermione.  This scatters the merpeople.  Harry frees Gabrielle and begins swimming to the surface, pulling Ron and Gabrielle with him. On the way, Harry is viciously attacked by a herd of Grindylows.  He pushes Ron and Gabrielle upwards, draws his wand and scatters the Grindylows.  He then propels himself to the surface using a spell, but still finishes outside the task's one hour time limit.  Despite this, he is awarded second place in the trial because he was delayed by his decision to risk himself to free Gabrielle.  

A traditional part of the Triwizard tournament is the Yule Ball; Harry is especially concerned since, as one of the champions, he is expected to open the dance. Cho turns him down, as Cedric Diggory has already asked her, and Hermione declines, though Harry does not find out until the Yule ball that it is Krum himself who has invited her. Eventually, Harry asks Parvati Patil, who accepts; her sister Padma partners Ron. Although Hermione greatly enjoys the ball, Harry and Ron do not; Ron, who is particularly jealous of Krum, accuses Hermione of "fraternising with the enemy," leading to a serious row between the two characters.

For the third task, the Triwizard cup is placed inside a large maze whose magical hedges are capable of attacking the champions as they attempt to reach it: the first champion to touch the cup will be declared the winner. Harry and Cedric reach the cup together and decide to claim a draw, both touching the cup at the same time. The cup turns out to be a Snape, and McGonagall burst in the room and stun Moody; he begins to change shape as they watch and quickly transforms into Barty Crouch Junior, who has been impersonating Moody all year in order to ensure that Harry was entered into the Triwizard Tournament as part of Voldemort's plan to regenerate himself using Harry. The school year ends as the foreign schools depart after Dumbledore exhorts them to stand together against Voldemort.

== Differences from the book ==
With the ''Goblet of Fire'' novel almost twice the length of ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', the writers and producers reduced certain scenes and concepts that made the transition from page to screen. Director Mike Newell described the problem as one of "compressing [a] huge book into the compass of a movie."<ref name=btm1></ref> This was achieved by "putting aside" all the components of the novel which did not directly relate to Harry and his journey.<ref name=btm1/> Even producer David Heyman admitted missing many of the scenes which were removed.<ref name="gof-red-carpet-video"></ref> In particular, the game play at the the following film.<ref name="gof-red-carpet-video"/>

As in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', most of the classes shown in the book were removed, only the single lesson where Alastor Moody demonstrates the the Burrow on the morning of the Quidditch World Cup. The arrival of Mr. Weasley in Privet Drive was also cut.<ref name="digitalspy"></ref> This makes ''Goblet of Fire'' the first and, to date, only film in the series in which the Dursleys do not appear. Other scenes are shortened and amalgamated to include only the most essential plot details; the three Death Eater trials Harry witnesses in the Pensieve are merged into one short sequence, and all of Sirius Black's lines are condensed into a single fireside conversation.<ref name=digitalspy/> While in the book, Barty Crouch Jr is portrayed in the trial scene as perhaps being innocent, or dead, in the film he is portrayed as being unremorseful and remarkably more vicious. The attack on the World Cup campground is depicted as a general terror attack against the wizards and witches in the film, whereas in the book the attack is confined to a small group of Muggles (although the book does describe damage of wizard property), and the graveyard scene is much shorter and confined than the scene in the novel. The scene involving Fred and George attempting to cheat their way into the tournament with an aging potion is changed so that Hermione's concerned warnings become smart-aleck scoffs, and Fred and George begin fighting with each other, rather than laughing along with everyone else, when they grow beards as a result. Many other sequences such as the Yule Ball and the romantic hate-love tension between Hermione and Ron were stretched out longer than they had been in the novel.

In addition to large slices of the school year, many characters, such as Winky and Dobby, the house-elves.<ref name=digitalspy/> In particular, the Skeeter subplot from the novel is all but eliminated, particularly Hermione's discovery of Skeeter's ability to change form and her later revenge on Skeeter (which sets up a subplot in the book, but not film, version of ''Order of the Phoenix''). In the movie, both Beauxbatons and Durmstrang appear to be single-sex schools.  All of the Beauxbatons visitors to Hogwarts are girls, while all the Durmstrang students are boys.  In the book, both schools are co-educational and send both boys and girls to visit Hogwarts. Viktor Krum's lines, infatuation with Hermione and scenes with Hermione are extremely limited, as well as mentions of Fleur's veela-lineage and their parts are considerably smaller. (Consequently, Ron's abruptly asking Fleur to the ball is not a result of her accidentally using her veela enchantment on him while attempting to enchant someone else, but rather him childishly losing his head at the sight of her "walking".) The Yule Ball argument between Ron and Hermione was shorter and less intense, and ended with Hermione in tears, which was not how it ended in the book. The arrival of the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students at Hogwarts is also treated with much more pomp and circumstance in the film than in the book, with both visiting groups performing drill team-like exercises, and their arrival is also shown to be overall more friendly than in the book (with references to Fleur being disgruntled during Dumbledore's greeting address, for example, being omitted).

While the three tasks of the Triwizard tournament generally remained true to the original novel, certain adaptations were included, and the details stating that the tournament is not deadly (at least prior to Voldemort's trap) are removed for dramatic effect. The first task, whilst contained entirely within the stadium in the original book, is extended into an extensive chase scene through the Hogwarts buildings and grounds. The second task was almost entirely faithful to the novel, although the Grindylow attack was moved to the end of the sequence as the effects of the Gillyweed wears off. In addition, the fact that the prisoners in the second task were never in any danger is removed. Because Dobby is not present in the film, Neville instead gives Harry the Gillyweed, as was Barty Crouch Junior's original plan in the novel. The merpeople are depicted as being less friendly than they are in the book. For the third task, the scene giving the champions advance warning of the maze was removed, as were all of Harry's preparations for it. In the film, the maze itself is devoid of the magical creatures and enchantments that were present in the book; instead, Dumbledore warns the contestants "people change in the maze. Find the cup if you will, but be careful not to lose yourself". Apparently, in the film version, the only thing alive in the maze, besides the four contestants, are the bushes that the maze is made of, which attempt to grab the contestants several times. Krum, visibly under the Imperius Curse, still attempts to attack Cedric (although with the Killing Curse rather than the Cruciatus Curse and Cedric retaliates with a disarming charm that fails to disarm Krum but knocks him unconscious). In addition, the sphinx scene was removed. Another change was that in the book, the maze was built on the Quidditch Pitch. In the film however, it was built in the valley next to Hogwarts. It was also at least three times bigger than described in the book. In the book, Harry encounters several creatures such as a Boggart and giant spider; although these are not in the film, a game included on the DVD release of the film simulates the third task maze and includes these creatures.

The ending of the film is markedly different from the book, which has Cornelius Fudge refusing to believe Harry or Dumbledore regarding the Dark Lord's return and Dumbledore beginning to gather his forces (setting up the events of ''Order of the Phoenix''). The film omits this (along with Harry's hospitalisation) and jumps to Dumbledore's eulogy for Cedric, the farewells for the visiting students, and adds a film-specific exchange between Hermione and Harry about the fact "everything has changed."

===Critical reception===
The film was received very positively by critics, garnering an 89% "Cream of the Crop" rating at Prisoner of Azkaban received, they both are currently the most favourably reviewed Harry Potter films on the site. Likewise on Metacritic.com, the film has again the same as the Prisoner of Azkaban, with both films receiving an 81 out of 100, which indicates "universal acclaim", and they are again both the most favourably reviewed Harry Potter films on the site. The ''Variety'' described as delivering a "dimensional and nuanced performance".<ref name="variety"></ref> New cast members were also praised: Brendan Gleeson's portrayal of Mad-Eye Moody was described as "colourful";<ref name="variety"/> Miranda Richardson's scenes as Rita Skeeter were described as "wonderful";<ref name="nydailynews"/> and Ralph Fiennes's portrayal of Lord Voldemort was described as "sublime villainy".<ref name=nyt> (Requires membership)</ref>

The maturity of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, among others, impressed most critics. While the major characters were portrayed as children in the previous films, "they have subtly transitioned into teenagers (in ''Goblet of Fire'')" according to one ''USA Today'' reviewer. Harry has also physically matured since ''Prisoner of Azkaban''. In the scene in the prefects' bathroom, Daniel Radcliffe's character is shown with significant axillary hair and muscle growth. 

Negative criticism included the film's pace which ''The Arizona Republic'' described as being "far too episodic",<ref></ref> while CNN.com described the film as "clunky and disjointed".<ref name="cnn"></ref> Another criticism was that the many supporting characters did not get enough screen time.<ref name="cnn" /><ref name="variety" /> Some fans criticised the film for changing and leaving out too much of the source material, particularly those parts that developed character,<ref></ref> and those parts of the story that set-up events that occur later in the series.<ref></ref>

'''Harry Potter und der Feuerkelch''' ist die Verfilmung des gleichnamigen Romans der englischen Autorin Joanne K. Rowling aus dem Jahr 2005 unter der Regie von Mike Newell. Die Weltpremiere war am 6. November 2005 in London. In Deutschland und Österreich startete er am 16. November 2005. Der Film spielte weltweit ca. 890 Mio.

== Handlung ==
Der vierte Teil steht ganz im Zeichen internationaler Wettbewerbe. Die Weltmeisterschaft im Quidditch steht an, und in Hogwarts werden zwei ausländische Schulen zum Trimagischen Turnier erwartet.

Alle warten begierig auf die Wahl der Kandidaten – von jeder Schule einer –, die gegeneinander antreten werden, doch zur Verwunderung aller wird Harry, der eigentlich viel zu jung ist, vom Feuerkelch als vierter Teilnehmer bestimmt.

Nun muss sich Harry mit Drachen und Unterwasserwesen auseinandersetzen und sich durch ein riesiges Labyrinth kämpfen. Er kommt einem Komplott des bösen Magiers Voldemort auf die Spur, der wieder einmal versucht, zu alter Stärke zu gelangen.

== Kritiken ==

Trotz der umfangreichen Kürzung, die insbesondere die Geschehnisse um die Quidditch-Weltmeisterschaft betreffen, wurde aus dem zugehörigen Buch ein verständlicher Film gemacht. Der Film sollte laut Regisseur kein Kinder- oder Märchenfilm werden, sondern ein Thriller, wofür das Buch auch bestens geeignet sei. In dem Film wird das gefühlsmäßige Dilemma zwischen Harry und Ron, der ihm die Teilnahme am Trimagischen Turnier neidet, und zwischen den Jungs und Mädchen im Vorfeld des Weihnachtsballs verdeutlicht.

Auch wenn, wie oben bereits erwähnt, der Anfang stark gekürzt wurde und die beiden Hauselfen Dobby und Winky gänzlich wegfielen, ließen es sich Drehbuchautor Steve Kloves und Regisseur Mike Newell nicht nehmen, einige amüsante Szenen hinzuzufügen. So ist der Tanzkurs in der Vorbereitung des Weihnachtsballs eine komplett neue Erfindung, deren Komik aber gerade durch die Wiedererkennung klassischer Verhaltensmuster zwischen pubertierenden Jungs und Mädchen funktioniert.

* ''„‚Harry Potter und der Feuerkelch‘ ist eben nicht nur ein Gruselfilm, sondern erzählt auch eine andere Geschichte: die der leidenden, pubertierenden Teenager. Die seltenen Momente, die die Beziehung der Protagonisten untereinander behandeln, sind liebevoll und zum Brüllen komisch. Tanzstunden sind für Jungen eine Qual, und dann noch mit der alten Lehrerin – schlimmer geht’s nicht. Die erste Liebe ist unbeholfen, aufregend und irgendwie lächerlich – Regisseur Newell versteht es, diesen Zustand umzusetzen. Treue Potter-Film-Fans haben im Übrigen große Freude an den körperlichen Veränderungen der Hauptdarsteller – die breiten Kreuze, die Muskeln und der beginnende Bartwuchs sind deutlich sichtbar. Immerhin hatten Daniel Radcliffe und Co. seit dem ersten Film fünf Jahre Zeit, zu wachsen.“'' – Stern <ref>[http://www.stern.de/unterhaltung/film/:Harry-Potter-Feuerkelch-F%FCrchtet-Zauberkinder/549638.html Stern: ''Fürchtet euch, ihr Zauberkinder'']</ref>
