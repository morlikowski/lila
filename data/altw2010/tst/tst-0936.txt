Behind the scenes, the show was known for its unusually cohesive and unified cast.

==Storylines and format==

The '''first season''' introduces the six main characters: Rachel Green, Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Joey Tribbiani, Chandler Bing and Ross Geller. Rachel, who left her fiance at the altar on her wedding day, has come to New York and ends up living with Monica. It establishes early on in the season that Ross has been infatuated with Rachel since the two characters attended high school. Several episodes revolve around his attempts to tell her how he feels. Meanwhile, Ross's estranged lesbian wife Carol is pregnant with his baby. This puts him and Carol's lesbian life partner, Susan (played by Janice (played by Maggie Wheeler) is introduced as a girlfriend Chandler breaks up with in an early episode but frequently returns to through the ensuing ten seasons.

The '''second season''' features more serialized storylines; it begins when Rachel discovers that Ross is dating Julie (played by Lauren Tom), someone he knew from grad school. Julie returns for several episodes early in the season. Rachel's attempts to tell Ross she likes him mirror his own failed attempts in the first season, though the characters eventually begin a relationship that lasts into the following season. Joey, a struggling actor in the first season, gets a part in a fictionalized version of the soap opera ''Days of Our Lives'' but loses the part soon after when he angers the writers by saying in an interview that he writes many of his own lines. Tom Selleck begins a recurring guest role as Dr. Richard Burke. Richard, a friend of Monica and Ross' parents who is recently divorced and with grown children, is 21 years older than Monica but despite this they date for the second half of the season. In the season finale, they end the relationship when they realize that he does not want any more children and she does. The second season also served to deepen Chandler and Joey's friendship. This becomes especially apparent in the episodes in which Joey temporarily moves out and a creepy guy named Eddie (Adam Goldberg) moves in. 

'''Season three''' took on a significantly greater serialized format.<ref></ref> Rachel begins working at Bloomingdales and Ross becomes jealous of her coworker, Mark. Ross and Rachel break up after Ross sleeps with the hot girl from the copy shop, Chloe. His insistence that he and Rachel were "on a break" becomes a running gag through the remaining seasons. The two show significant animosity towards each other through the second half of the season, though the Pete Becker, a millionaire who has a crush on her.  (played by Jon Favreau)  At first, she only sees him as a friend, but eventually, the two begin to date.  Preparing for what she thinks is a marriage proposal, Pete confides in her that he wants to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion.  After seeing him get beat up badly in two matches, she tells him he has to give it up.  Since he won't, she breaks up with him.

During the '''fourth season''', actress Lisa Kudrow became pregnant. This was written into the show by having Phoebe become a surrogate mother to the children of her brother and his wife (played by English woman called Emily (played by Helen Baxendale) and the finale, featuring the wedding of the characters, was filmed on location in London. Chandler and Monica sleep together when, after a wedding guest mistakes Monica for Ross' mother, Monica seeks comfort in the arms of a friend. Rachel, depressed by the impending wedding enough to chase away a potential boyfriend in Joshua, attends the wedding at the last minute, intending to tell Ross that she still loves him, but decides not to.  Things are thrown into chaos when Ross replaces Emily's name with Rachel's while saying his vows.

The '''fifth season''' follows Monica and Chandler keeping their new relationship a secret from their friends, while Ross' marriage to Emily ends before it even started, following their wedding (Baxendale's pregnancy prevented her from appearing on-screen in all but two episodes<ref></ref>). Phoebe starts a relationship with Gary (Las Vegas, they decide to get married. On a cliffhanger, Ross and Rachel drunkenly stumble out of the wedding chapel. It received 1999 for Outstanding Comedy Series

'''Season seven''' largely concerns various wedding-related antics by Monica and Chandler. Joey's television series is cancelled but he is offered his old job back on ''Days of Our Lives''. Phoebe's apartment is fixed but due to the way the apartment has been rebuilt, Rachel stays with Joey. The two-part season finale follows Monica and Chandler's wedding, with guest stars that include Kathleen Turner as Chandler's transvestite father. The closing moments of the season reveal that Rachel is pregnant.'''

The '''eighth season''''s first episodes follow a "Who's the father?" format, with the father revealed to be Ross in episode two and Rachel telling him in episode three. Joey begins to develop romantic feelings for roommate Rachel and when Joey's feelings are revealed things become awkward for the two. Eventually their friendship returns to its status quo but in the finale, following Rachel's giving birth to a daughter, she accepts an accidental Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2002. The first in that category for the series. 

The '''ninth season''' follows Ross and Rachel living together with baby Emma after she and Joey clear up the misdirected proposal. She soon moves back in with Joey after a fight with Ross. Monica and Chandler, inspired by Ross and Rachel, decide to conceive a child of their own. They seek medical advice after several episodes of trying for a baby, and discover that both of them are physically unable to conceive. Paul Rudd appears in the recurring role of Mike Hannigan, a new boyfriend for Phoebe. Hank Azaria returns as David "the scientist guy", a character originated in the first season, and Phoebe must choose between the two in a touching finale, deciding to choose Mike. The finale is set in Barbados, where the group goes to hear Ross give a keynote speech at a Paleontologist conference. Aisha Tyler appears as the series' first recurring black character.<ref></ref> Tyler plays Charlie, Joey's intelligent girlfriend.

The finale ends with Joey and Rachel kissing.

The '''tenth season''' closes up several storylines; Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross' feelings about them being together.  However, consummating the relationship becomes disastrous, and they decide to remain friends.  Charlie decides to return to Benjamin Hobart (Greg Kinnear), her old flame, and from whom Ross was trying to obtain a research grant.  Monica and Chandler decide to adopt a child, and meet Erica, a birth mother from Ohio (played by Anna Faris). Erica gives birth to twins in the series finale. Phoebe and Mike get married towards the end of the season and Rachel takes a job based in Paris. Ross declares his love for her and they resume their relationship (not making any mistakes this time) in the season finale, while Monica and Chandler move out of their apartment into the suburbs. Joey is upset that everything is changing. Rachel still gets on the plane even with Ross' confessions, but later appears at his apartment door admitting she loves him too. In the series finale, at the end, a tearful Rachel says 'Shall we go get some coffee?' to which Chandler sarcastically responds, 'Sure. Where?' (the last words spoken on the show).

==Production==
''Friends'' was created in 1993 by David Crane and Dream On''. ''Friends'' was aimed at young adults who, during the early 1990s, were identified by their café culture, dating scene and modern independence.<ref name="sa">{{cite news|title='Friends' say final goodbye.

Originally to be named ''Across the Hall'', ''Six of One'', ''Insomnia Café'', or ''Friends Like Us'',<ref></ref> ''Friends'' was produced by U.S., and was first broadcast on that network. 'Friends' debuted on NBC Thursday night line-up. Kauffman and Crane note only one moment they would take back - the use of the line "I'm wearing two belts," in two different episodes and seasons.<ref name="sa" /> The final episode aired on M*A*S*H'', ''Broadway musical, 1776. The opening scene was shot at about 4:00 a.m. while it was particularly cold for a Burbank morning.<ref></ref>

After the series finale in 2004, the spin-off show ''Joey'' was created. Many fans criticized NBC's decision to give the character his own show, and ratings decreased significantly between the first and second season.<ref></ref> Forty-six episodes were filmed, but only 38 episodes aired in the U.S. The show was canceled on May 15, 2006. The entire series has been released and is available for purchase in a DVD Boxset.

==Cultural impact==

''Friends'' has made a notable contribution to some areas of popular culture - in particular fashion. The series has been noted for its impact on everyday fashion and hairstyles. Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed "The Rachel" and copied around the world.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20040429/ai_n12540375 'The Rachel' remains a cut above the rest] by Jae-Ha Kim, ''Chicago Sun-Times'', April 29 2004. Retrieved June 15 2006</ref>

Joey Tribbiani's catchphrase "How ''you'' doin'?" has become a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends.<ref></ref> The show also popularized the idea of the "laminated list", a list of celebrities that a person's partner will permit them to sleep with if they were to ever meet them. In "The One with Frank Jr." the characters exchange "lists" verbally, while Ross creates a physical list and laminates it, making his choices permanent. The concept of the laminated list has been adopted by the Hollywood Stock Exchange website.<ref></ref>

The phrase "Ross and Rachel" has appeared as a joke in ''Scrubs'': the janitor describes J.D.'s relationship with Elliot as "not exactly Ross and Rachel." Friends has been referenced again in the Scrubs episode, "One Tree Hill'' (Lucas' and Lindsay's wedding), a character references Ross saying the wrong name at the altar when he was marrying Emily. In one episode of the British show ''Skins'', a English from Friends, and uses many of the catchphrases (such as "How you doin'" and "We were on a break") as a recurring joke.

One of the principal settings of the series, the park in the city) and the 'Riverdale Perk' in Toronto. In 2006 Iranian businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a "Central Perk" franchise, registering the name in 32 countries. The décor of his coffee houses are inspired by that in ''Friends''. James Michael Tyler, who plays Gunther, the Central Perk waiter in love with Rachel, attended the grand opening of the flagship Dubai café and is the spokesman for the company.<ref></ref>

The name of every ''Friends'' episode, with the exceptions of the very first and last episodes (titled 'Pilot' and 'The Last One' respectively), starts with 'The One...', e.g. 'The One with Ross' Inappropriate Song', though the Pilot is sometimes called 'The One where Monica gets a Roommate', or 'The One Where It All Began'. In continuing with this tradition, a boxed set containing all ten seasons on DVD was called "The One With All Ten Seasons". This tradition is based on the way people, when unable to remember the actual title of an episode of a TV show, will describe it as "it's the one with..." and then state the main storyline of the episode. 

A ''Parody'' of Friends was created in Britain called ''Chums'' and was aired on SM-TV. It features 3 characters named Ant, Dec and Cat Deely.Cat Deely can be seen as a parody of Rachel's actions. The episodes include short episodes, also beginning with 'The One...'. Most of the episodes feature pretend shows like Pokefight, based on ''Pokemon''. Also Nickelodeon's 'Snick' used to make short episodes called 'Buds' with the Snick cast. They would act like the friends cast but with different, pointless plots.

Over the show's 10-year run, it mainly won Emmy Awards over other awards, such as Golden Globes and SAG Awards. It won 6 Emmys out of 63 nominations.
