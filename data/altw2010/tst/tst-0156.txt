'''Lee-Enfield No 5''' on brittiläinen 1940-luvulla kehitetty pulttilukkoinen sotilaskivääri.

== Historia== 
Brittijoukkojen kokemukset viidakkosodankäynnistä toisen maailmansodan aikana Burmassa, Papua-Uudessa Guineassa ja tyynenmeren saarilla osoittivat, että käytössä olleet Lee-Enfield kiväärit olivat viidakossa liikkumiseen liian pitkiä ja painavia. Tämä johti uuden No. 5 Mk I -version kehittämiseen; se oli 127 mm lyhyempi ja 0,85 kg kevyempi versio No4 MkI - kivääristä. Lyhennetty piippu vaati liekinsammuttimen käyttöönoton ja uudenmallisen pistimen. Kiväärin etutukkia ja kädensijaa lyhennettiin<ref>http://enfieldrifles.profusehost.net/ri12a.htm</ref> ja tukkiin lisättiin kuminen perälevy aseen lisääntyneen rekyylin vuoksi<ref>http://enfieldrifles.profusehost.net/ri12.htm</ref>. Lisäksi perässä oleva hihnalenkki siirrettiin tukin kylkeen. Aseen koneisto oli sama kuin Lee-Enfield No.4 kiväärissä, mutta sekä aseen runkoa, että piippua kevennettiin kevennysleikkauksilla<ref>http://enfieldrifles.profusehost.net/ri12a.htm</ref>.   

Asetta valmistettiin vuosina 1944 - 1947 yli 251&nbsp;136 kappaletta<ref>http://www.nrapublications.org/tar/JungleCarbine.asp</ref>.

'''Jungle Carbine''' was an informal term used for the '''Rifle No. 5 Mk I''', which was a derivative of the British Lee Enfield No. 4 Mk I, designed especially for fighting in the Far East and Burma and other terrain where the length and weight of the standard rifle made it unsuitable.  Production began in March 1944, and finished in October 1947.

The No. 5 was about 100 mm shorter and nearly a kilogram lighter than the No. 4 from which it was derived. A number of "lightening cuts" were made to the receiver body and the barrel, the bolt knob drilled out, woodwork cut down to reduce weight and had other new features like a flash suppressor and a rubber buttpad to help absorb the increased recoil. However, as the buttpad had a smaller surface area than the standard Lee-Enfield buttplate, it actually concentrated the force of recoil into a smaller area of the shooter's shoulder.

The term "Jungle Carbine" was colloquial and never officially applied by the British Armed Forces, but the Rifle No. 5 Mk I was supposedly referred to as the "Jungle Carbine" by British and Commonwealth troops during WWII and the Malayan Emergency.     

Due to the large conical flash suppressor, the No 5 Mk I could only mount the No. 5 blade bayonet, which was also designed to serve as a combat knife if needed.

== Post-war non-military conversions ==

Though they did not invent the name, the designation "Jungle Carbine" was popularised by the Santa Fe Arms Corporation in the mid to late 1950s. Santa Fe imported huge numbers of SMLE Mk III* and Lee-Enfield No. 4 rifles and converted them to civilian versions of the No. 5 Mk I for the hunting and recreational shooting markets in the US. Prospective buyers must be very sure they can tell the difference between a real No. 5 and a conversion. The easiest way to do this is to look for the markings on the left hand side of the receiver; a genuine No. 5 will have "Rifle No 5 Mk I" electrostencilled there, while a post-war conversion will generally have either no markings or markings from manufacturers who did not make the No. 5 Mk I (for example, Savage or Long Branch).

Companies such as the Gibbs Rifle Company in the U.S. have sold completely re-built Enfields of all descriptions, but most notably their copies of "jungle carbines" (made from original No. 1 and No. 4 rifles) and the "Bulldog" rifles (also fashioned from original No. 1 and No. 4 rifles). As long as a vendor is not trying to pass one of these rifles off as a genuine No. 5, there shouldn't be any confusion over their origin and type, but not every gun owner or gun dealer is a surplus military firearms expert and mistakes (both accidental and intentional) do occur.
The deliberate, permanent modification of military surplus firearms (loosely defined in the US as any ex-military firearm that is eligible for possession on a 03 FFL C&R license) is not only actively discouraged, but a source of constant despair to the military surplus firearms collecting community, especially when it causes as much confusion as it has with these civilian conversions of Enfields to  No. 5 Mk I configurations.
