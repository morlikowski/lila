== History ==
thumb|left|Gallatin County Courthouse
The county was formed on Franklin and Shelby counties. Later, parts of the county were pared off to create three additional counties: Owen in 1819, Trimble in 1836 and Carroll in 1838. Today Gallatin is one tenth of its original size.

The Confederate forces reportedly were in control of Gallatin and several other Kentucky counties. The report went on to state that the Confederates forces were rapidly recruiting volunteers in the area.

After the end of the American Civil War, the Warsaw was the scene of one of the worst steamboat accidents in history. Two passenger steamers, the America and the United States, collided. The United States carried a cargo of barrels of kerosene, which caught fire, and soon both boats were in flames. The death toll reached 162.

As the twentieth century progressed, the river trade began to decline, and the steamboat era ended. Gallatin County is traversed by I-71, U.S. 42, and U.S. 127 highways. Construction on the Markland Locks and Dam began in 1956 and was completed in 1964. In 1967 a hydroelectric power plant was built at the dam and provided jobs, but in the 1980s more than 50 percent of the population was employed outside the county.[http://www.rootsweb.com/~kygalla2/history.htm]
