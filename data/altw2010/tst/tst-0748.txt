A '''sanctuary lamp''', '''altar lamp''', or '''eternal flame''' is a light that shines before the altar of sanctuaries in many denominations of Jewish and Christian places of worship.<ref>[http://xrysostom.blogspot.com/2006/01/sanctuary-lamps.html Ask the Pastor: Sanctuary Lamps]</ref>  Prescribed in [http://bibleresources.bible.com/passagesearchresults.php?passage1=Exodus+27%3A20-22&version1=9 Exodus 27:20-22] of the Hebrew Bible, this icon has taken on different meanings in each of the religions that have adopted it. The passage, which refers to prescriptions for the Temple in Jerusalem, states:

In Judaism, the sanctuary lamp is known by its Hebrew name, '''ner tamid''' (נר תמיד), which is usually translated as "eternal flame" or "eternal light."  Hanging or standing in front of the ark in every Jewish menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem as well as the continuously burning fire on the altar of burnt offerings in front of the Temple.<ref></ref> It also symbolizes God's eternal presence, and is therefore never extinguished. They are also intended to draw parallels between God and fire, or light, which is emphasized throughout the book of Exodus in the Torah.

In a Reform-Jewish congregation, it is often used to symbolize the light released from the shards of the receptacles that God used to create light and goodness.  

These lights are never allowed to dim or go out, and in the case of electric problems, often alternate emergency energy sources are used to prevent it from diminishing.  

Though once fueled by oil, most today are electric lights. The ner tamid at Temple Sinai in Worcester, MA is solar powered, symbolizing that synagogue's commitment to reducing dependencies on non-renewable resources.

==In Christian tradition==
