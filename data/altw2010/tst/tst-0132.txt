'''Lincoln City''' is a city in Lincoln County, Oregon, United States. It is named after the county. The population was 7,437 at the 2000 census.

== History ==
Lincoln City was incorporated on unincorporated communities of Cutler City and Nelscott. These were adjacent communities along U.S. Route 101, which serves as Lincoln City's main street. The name "Lincoln City" was chosen from contest entries submitted by local school children. The contest was held when it was determined that using one of the five communities' names would be too controversial.<ref name="LCCVB">{{cite web
