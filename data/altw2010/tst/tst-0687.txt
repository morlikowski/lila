'''''Megalosaurus''''' (meaning "Great Lizard", from Greek, ''μεγαλο-/megalo-'' meaning 'big', 'tall' or 'great' and ''σαυρος/sauros'' meaning 'lizard') is a Period (Bathonian) of Europe (Southern England, France, Portugal). 

==Discovery==

''Megalosaurus'' was the first Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England in 1676. The fragment was sent to Robert Plot, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford and first curator of the Ashmolean Museum, who published a description in his ''Natural History of Oxfordshire'' in 1677. He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the femur of a large animal and he recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species; he considered it to be the thigh bone of a giant. The bone has since been lost but the illustration is detailed enough to identify it clearly as the femur of a ''Megalosaurus''.<ref name=WAS97></ref>

The Cornwell bone was described again by Richard Brookes in 1763. He named it ''Scrotum humanum'', while describing its similar appearance to a pair of human testicles. The label was not considered to be a "name" for the animal in question at the time, and was not used in subsequent literature. Technically, the name was published after the advent of binomial nomenclature, and although this name theoretically had priority over ''Megalosaurus'', the rules of the ICZN state that if a name falls into disuse for 50 years after publication, it is no longer in competition for priority. Therefore, the name ''Scrotum humanum'' is a ''nomen oblitum'', or "forgotten name".<ref name="halstead1970">Halstead, L.B. (1970). "''Scrotum humanum'' Brookes 1763 - the first named dinosaur." ''Journal of Insignificant Research'', '''5''': 14-15.</ref>

More discoveries were made, starting in 1815, again at the Christ Church. He did not know to what animal the bones belonged but, in 1818, after the French comparative anatomist Georges Cuvier visited Buckland in Oxford and realised that the bones belonged to a giant lizard-like creature. Buckland then published descriptions of the bones in ''Transactions of the Geological Society'', in 1824 (Physician James Parkinson had described them in an article in 1822).

By 1824, Buckland had a piece of a lower jaw with teeth, some Ferdinand von Ritgen gave this dinosaur a complete binomial, ''Megalosaurus conybeari'', which was not used by later authors and is now considered a ''nomen oblitum''. A year later, in 1827, Gideon Mantell included ''Megalosaurus'' in his geological survey of southeastern England, and assigned the species its current binomial name, ''Megalosaurus bucklandii''.<ref name="mantell1827">Mantell, G. (1827). "Illustrations of the geology of Sussex: a general view of the geological relations of the southeastern part of England, with figures and descriptions of the fossils of Tilgate Forest."</ref> It would not be until 1842 that Richard Owen coined the term 'dinosaur'.

In 1997, a famous group of fossilised footprints (ichnites) was found in a limestone quarry at Ardley, 20 km Northeast of Oxford, England. They were thought to have been made by ''Megalosaurus'' and possibly also some left by ''Cetiosaurus''. There are replicas of some of these footprints, set across the lawn of Oxford University Museum of Natural History.

==Description==
Since those first finds, many other ''Megalosaurus'' bones have been recovered but still no complete skeleton has been found. Therefore, the details of Megalosaurus's physical appearance cannot be certain.

===Early reconstructions===

In 1852, papers can still cause confusion. For further confusion, the most reproduced anatomy diagram of a ''Megalosaurus''' skeleton was produced before any vertebrae had been recovered. While drawing it, Friedrich von Huene of the University of Tübingen, Germany, instead used the backbones of ''Altispinax'', a mysterious big theropod known from high-spined dorsal vertebrae and at times classified as a spinosaur. Hence, many later drawings, based on his original, show ''Megalosaurus'' with a deep spinal ridge or even a small sail, like that of ''Spinosaurus''.

O '''megalossauro''' (''Megalosaurus bucklandi'', do latim "lagarto grande") foi um dinossauro carnívoro e bípede que viveu durante o período Jurássico, media de 8 a 9 metros de comprimento e pesava em torno de duas toneladas. Uma característica pouco comum nesse dinossauro é o pescoço muito curto e muito forte, adaptado para sustentar sua enorme cabeça.

O megalossauro viveu na região que é hoje a Europa. Em meados de 1676 foi encontrado na Inglaterra o primeiro osso fossilizado de dinossauro, entretanto na época ninguém tinha idéia de que se tratava de um animal pré-histórico, consideraram então o osso como sendo de um homem gigante. Mais tarde, em 1815, William Buckland descobriria fósseis na mesma região, mas agora o conhecimento já estava maduro suficiente para entender que tais ossos pertenceram a um grande animal pré-histórico, batizado de ''Megalosaurus''. Sobre o osso de 1676 nunca mais houve notícias, mas tudo indica que se tratava do fêmur de um megalossauro adulto, sendo assim o megalossauro foi o primeiro dinossauro a ser descoberto, além de ter sido o primeiro dinossauro descrito científicamente, no ano de 1824 pelo seu descobridor William Buckland.
