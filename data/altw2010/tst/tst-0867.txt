On the 6th of March in 2008, The European Commission launched an in-depth investigation of OMV's unsolicited bid to take over MOL. As commented by European Commissioner Neeile Kroes, the "proposed acquisition may raise competition concerns in a number of markets".

==Operations==

The company is a key player in the upstream business with over 70&nbsp;years experience in Hungary and 15&nbsp;years in the international arena. The Society of Petroleum Engineers approved 2P (proved plus probable) reserves were 340.6&nbsp;MMboe and MOL's hydrocarbon production was 90.4&nbsp;Mboe/day in 2007.

MOL operates three highly complex refineries (336,000&nbsp;Bbl/day refining capacity) with outstanding product yields and with retail and wholesale activities supported by an extensive crude and product pipeline system. Its refineries at Százhalombatta, Hungary and Bratislava, Slovakia, are among the most profitable in Europe, thanks to residuals processing technologies, which allow fuel oil to be almost entirely eliminated from the product mix, meaning more profitable gasoline and diesel fuel can be produced.MOL's filling stations amounted to 1000 at the end of 2007.
 
MOL's petrochemical division is one of the largest polymer producer in Central Europe, operated in full integration with MOL's Refining & Marketing division. Its products are sold in more than 40&nbsp;countries.
