'''Андре Вейл''' () е френски учен, един от най-значимите математици на 20 век. Вейл е един от петимата основатели и неформални лидери на известната математическа група, която издава трудове под колективния псевдоним „Никола Бурбаки“.

През 1928 г. завършва алгебрично алгебрико-геометрични подходи за решението на задачи от областта на теория на числата.

От 1958 г. е професор в Института за перспективни изследвания (Institute of Advanced Studies) в Американското математическо общество, както и приза Wolf заедно със съветския математик Андрей Колмогоров.<ref>"Выдающиеся математики", А. И. Бородин, А. С. Бугай, "Радянська школа", Киев, 1987</ref>

Андре Вейл е брат на френската писателка и философ Симон Вейл.

:André Weil ''should not be confused with two other mathematicians with similar names:
*Hermann Weyl (1885-1955), ''who made substantial contributions to theoretical physics and number theory. In 1944, he helped Weil obtain a Guggenheim fellowship.
*conjecture partly due to Weil and who, like Weil, has done important work in elliptic curves;

'''André Weil''' (May 6, 1906 - August 6, 1998) (<ref>In English, "Weil" is  ''vay'', while "Weyl" is  ''vial'' and "Wiles" is  ''why-ulz''. However, in Russian the names Weil and Weyl are pronounced in the same way (as  ''vail''). </small></ref>) was one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, renowned for the breadth and quality of his research output, its influence on future work, and the elegance of his exposition. He is especially known for his foundational work in number theory and algebraic geometry. He was a founding member and the ''de facto'' early leader of the influential Bourbaki group. The philosopher Simone Weil was his sister.

==Life==
Born in Alsatian doctorate in 1928. While in Germany, he befriended Carl Ludwig Siegel. He spent two academic years at Aligarh Muslim University from 1930. Sanskrit literature was a life-long interest. After one year in Marseilles, he taught six years in Strasbourg. He married Eveline in 1937.

Weil was in Finland when World War II broke out; he had been traveling in Scandinavia since April 1939. Eveline returned to France without him. The following anecdote is taken from his autobiography: after having been arrested under suspicion of espionage in Finland, when the USSR attacked on 30 November 1939, he was saved from being shot only by the intervention of Rolf Nevanlinna. This is the version that Nevanlinna propagated after the war. However, such a story is a bit too good to be true. In 1992, the Finnish mathematician Osmo Pekonen went to the archives to check the facts. Based on the documents, he established that Weil was not really going to be shot, even if he was under arrest, and that Nevanlinna probably didn't do - and didn't need to do - anything to save him. Pekonen published a paper<ref>Osmo Pekonen: ''L'affaire Weil à Helsinki en 1939'', Gazette des mathématiciens 52 (avril 1992), pp. 13—20. With an afterword by André Weil.</ref> on this with an afterword by André Weil himself. Nevanlinna's motivation for concocting such a story of himself as the rescuer of a famous Jewish mathematician probably was the fact that he had been a Nazi sympathizer during the war. The story also appears in Nevanlinna's autobiography, published in Finnish, but the dates don't match with real events at all. It is true, however, that Nevanlinna housed Weil in the summer of 1939 at his summer residence Korkee at Lohja in Finland - and offered Hitler's Mein Kampf as bedside reading. Weil signed 'Bourbaki' in Nevanlinna's guestbook.                                 

Weil returned to France via Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was detained at Cherbourg. After the fall of France, he met up with his family in Marseilles, where he arrived by sea. He then went to Clermont-Ferrand, where he managed to join Eveline, who had been in German-occupied France.

In January 1941, Weil and his family sailed from Marseilles to New York. He spent the war in the United States, where he was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and Guggenheim Foundation. For two years, he unhappily taught undergraduate mathematics at Lehigh University. He taught at the Universidade de São Paulo, 1945-47, where he worked with Oscar Zariski. He taught at the University of Chicago from 1947 to 1958, before spending the remainder of his career at the Institute for Advanced Study. In 1979, he shared the second Wolf Prize in Mathematics.

==Work==

He made substantial contributions in many areas, the most important being his discovery of profound connections between algebraic geometry and number theory. This began in his doctoral work leading to the Mordell-Weil theorem (1928, and shortly applied in Siegel's theorem on integral points). Mordell's theorem had an ''ad hoc'' proof; Weil began the separation of the infinite descent argument into two types of structural approach, by means of height functions for sizing rational points, and by means of Galois cohomology, which was not to be clearly named as that for two more decades. Both aspects have steadily developed into substantial theories. 

Among his major accomplishments were the 1940 proof, while in prison, of the Riemann hypothesis for local zeta-functions, and his subsequent laying of proper foundations for algebraic geometry to support that result (from 1942 to 1946, most intensively). By modern standards his claim to have a proof had a very easy ride, but wartime conditions were one factor, and the fact that the German experts made little or no comment another. The so-called Weil conjectures were hugely influential from around 1950; they were later proved by Bernard Dwork, Alexander Grothendieck, Michael Artin, and Pierre Deligne, who completed the most difficult step in 1973. 

He had introduced the adele ring in the late 1930s, following Claude Chevalley's lead with the ideles, and given a proof of the Riemann-Roch theorem with them (a version appeared in his ''Basic Number Theory'' in 1967). His 'matrix divisor' (vector bundle ''avant le jour'') Riemann-Roch theorem from 1938 was a very early anticipation of later ideas such as moduli spaces of bundles. The Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers proved resistant for many years. Eventually the adelic approach became basic in automorphic representation theory. He picked up another credited ''Weil conjecture'', around 1970, which later under pressure from Serge Lang became known as the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture based on the presentation of the basic ideas at the 1955 Nikkō conference. His attitude towards conjectures struck many in the field as oblique; he wrote that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Shimura-Taniyama case, the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late 1960s.

Other significant results were on Pontryagin duality and differential geometry. He introduced the concept of uniform space in general topology. His work on sheaf theory hardly appears in his published papers, but correspondence with Henri Cartan in the late 1940s, and reprinted in his collected papers, proved most influential.
