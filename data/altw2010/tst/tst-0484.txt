'''COSATU''' ('''C'''ongress '''O'''f '''S'''outh '''A'''frican '''T'''rade '''U'''nions [en syndicats et fédérations de travailleurs d'Afrique du Sud. Il est affillié à la Confédération syndicale internationale.
Au début, il ne représentait qu'un demi-million de travailleurs venant de 33 unions, mais il a eu une forte croissance pour atteindre 1.8 millions de travailleurs.
Le COSATU a joué un role majeur dans la lutte contre l'apartheid, organisant une série de grèves tres efficaces à travers le pays.
Un ouvrage d'autorité fut publié par ce mouvement : ''Striking Back''.
Ce mouvement émanait du peuple et avait une réelle base démocratique. 

Les année 90, marquées par la fin de l'apartheid, furent également témoin du ralentissement du mouvement.
L'ANC, parti dominant (et de plus en plus fort), n'a rien fait non plus pour le soutenir car il représentait un rival puissant.
L'ANC, contrairement au COSATU, n'émane pas des foules et ne possède pas autant de ramification lui donnant une structure démocratique forte.

The '''Congress of South African Trade Unions''' (COSATU) is a trade union federation in South Africa. It was founded in 1985 and is the biggest of the country’s three main trade union federations, with 21 affiliated trade unions, altogether organising 1.8 million workers.

==Establishment==
COSATU was established in 1985 following unity talks between competing unions and federations. At its launch it represented less than half a million workers organised in 33 unions, but saw rapid growth in its early years. Elijah Barayi was the organisation’s first president and served until 1991.  Other key leaders included Jay Naidoo and Cyril Ramaphosa.  COSATU played a leading role in the struggle against apartheid, organising a range of highly effective wage strikes and also general strikes and mobilising support in factories and towns across the country.  The most authoritative account of its early years is a book called Striking Back, written by a former COSATU leader Jeremy Baskin and covering the period from 1985 until the release of Nelson Mandela in 1990.

==Government==
COSATU is part of an alliance with the ANC and the South African Communist Party, often called the tripartite alliance. COSATU’s role in the alliance has been the subject of debate, since the organisation has been critical of some of the ANC government's policies. While some affiliates have argued for greater independence from the ruling political party, others have argued that the arrangement gives COSATU a political influence beneficial to its members.

==Labour and HIV/AIDS==

South Africa has one of the largest incidence of HIV/AIDS in the world, with a 2005 estimate of 5.5 million people living with HIV — 12.4% of the population.<ref>{{cite web

COSATU passed a resolution in 1998 to campaign for treatment. “It was clear to the labour movement at that time that its lowest paid members were dying because they couldn’t afford medicines,” says Theodora Steel, Campaigns Coordinator at COSATU. “We saw TAC as a natural ally
in a campaign for treatment. We passed a formal resolution at our congress to assist and build TAC.<ref>{{cite web

Notwithstanding the formal alliance of COSATU with the ruling ANC party, it has been at odds with the government, calling for the roll-out of comprehensive public access to antiretroviral drugs.<ref>{{cite web
