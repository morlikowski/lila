'''Robert Shiller''' (født Irrational Exuberance'' (2000) ble en New York Times-bestselger, som advarte om at aksjemarkedet sent på 1990-tallet hadde blitt en aksjemarkedsboble som kunne lede til en kraftig nedgang.

Shiller mottok sin B.A. fra University of Michigan i 1967 og hans Ph.D. fra MIT i 1972. Fra 1982 har han undervist ved Yale og holdt tidligere en fakultetsposisjon ved Wharton School ved University of Pennsylvania og University of Minnesota.

He has written on economic topics that range from behavioral finance to real estate to risk management, and has been co-organizer of NBER workshops on behavioral finance with Richard Thaler since 1991. His book ''Macro Markets'' won the first annual Paul A. Samuelson Award of TIAA-CREF. He currently publishes a syndicated column. 

In 1981 Shiller published an article in the ''efficient markets model, which at that time was the dominant view in the economics profession. Shiller argued that in a rational stock market, investors would base stock prices on the expected receipt of future dividends, discounted to a present value. He examined the performance of the U.S. stock market since the 1920s, and considered the kinds of expectations of future dividends and discount rates that could justify the wide range of variation experienced in the stock market. Shiller concluded that the volatility of the stock market was greater than could plausibly be explained by any rational view of the future.   

The behavioral finance school gained new credibility following the October 1987 stock market crash. Shiller's work included survey research that asked investors and stock traders what motivated them to make trades; the results further bolstered his hypothesis that these decisions are often driven by emotion instead of rational calculation. Much of this survey data has been gathered continuously since 1989, and is available at Yale's [http://icf.som.yale.edu/confidence.index/ Investor Behavior Project].

Shiller's most recent book is ''The New Financial Order: Risk in the 21st Century'' (2003).

'''Robert James "Bob" Shiller''' (born 1946) is an American economist, academic, and best-selling author. He has been a research associate of the Irrational Exuberance'' (2000) --- a bubble in March 2000 (the very height of the market top) which could lead to a sharp decline. 

He also had the foresight and sanity to note in 2005 on CNBC's "How to Profit from the Real Estate Boom" two hour special that housing price rises could not outstrip inflation in the long term because, except for land restricted sites, house prices would tend toward building costs plus normal economic profit.   Meanwhile, co-panelist, David Lereah, continued to cheerlead.  In February, Lereah had put out his book "Are You Missing the Real Estate boom" signaling the market top for housing prices.  While Shiller repeated his precise timing again for another market bubble, because the general level of nationwide residential real estate prices do not reveal themselves until after a lag of about one year, people did not believe Shiller had called another top until late 2006 and early 2007.

Shiller received his Paul A. Samuelson Award. He currently publishes a syndicated column.
