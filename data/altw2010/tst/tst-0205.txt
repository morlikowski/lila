The '''sittellas''' are a family, '''Neosittidae''', of small migrate other than for local movements.

The sittellas are small woodland birds with thin pointed down-curved bills, which they use to extricate insects from bark. Nests are open cups in forked branches. 

They were formerly classified in two separate genera with the Black Sittella in ''Daphoenositta'' and the Varied and Papuan Sittellas in ''Neositta''. The two genera are now usually merged with ''Daphoenositta'' having priority.
==Evolution and taxonomy==
The true evolutionary affinities of the sittellas have long been clouded by their close resemblance to the Northern Hemisphere Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA-DNA hybridization studies.<ref>Sibley C & J Ahlquist (1982) "The Relationships of the Australo-Papuan Sittellas ''Daphoenositta'' as indicated by DNA-DNA hybridization". ''Emu'' '''82''' (3): 173 - 176 </ref> These researchers placed the sittellas in a monotypic tribe within the superfamily Corvidae. Today they are afforded their own family in a clade close to the berrypeckers and longbills (Melanocharitidae) and the whistlers (Pachycephalidae).<ref name = "HBW/>

The sittellas contain a single genus, ''Daphoenositta'', which contains two species. The two species were once considered to be two genera, but when the two were lumped the genus name of the less well known Black Sittella was adopted (due to priority), while the family retained the family name based on the junior synonym (''Neositta''). The most common species, the Varied Sittella, was once thought to represent several separate species, including five species in Australia, but in spite of considerable variation in plumage there are extensive zones of hybridization where the forms overlap (including an area of Queensland where all five Australian species exist),<ref>Ford, J (1980) "Hybridization between contiguous subspecies of the Varied Sittella in Queensland". ''Emu'' '''80''' (1): 1-12 </ref> and are now thought to be a single species with eleven subspecies. The Black Sittella has three recognized subspecies.

==Morphology==

The two species of sittella are small flight, which may explain their inability to colonize suitable habitat on islands like bill is dagger shaped in the case of the Black Sittella and slightly upturned in the Varied Sittella. The plumage of the Black Sittella is mostly black with a red face; that of the Varied Sittella is more complex, with the numerous subspecies having many variations on the theme. The sexes of some subspecies have entirely black heads, other white, and others dark crowns and paler throats. The backs of most subspecies are grey with darker wings, and the undersides are generally streaked or white. All sittellas exhibit some sexual dimorphism in plumage. 
===Vocalizations===
The calls of sittellas are generally simple and uncomplicated. Apparently the family has no need for long distance territorial calls, and the majority of calls are simple contact calls utilized to retain flock cohesion.<ref name = "HBW/> The most commonly heard call is the ''chip'' contact call, although there also exists a rallying call (to call together the group), as well as begging calls issued by incubating females.

==Habitat and behaviour==
The sittellas are social and generally restless birds of scrub, forests and woodlands. In Australia they generally avoid only the dense rainforest, whereas in New Guinea this is the only habitat they inhabit, avoiding only lowland forest. They generally live at low densities, between 0.1 to 0.6 birds per hectare, and are territories against other groups. Within the groups, mutual preening is common, and in the evening the groups roost communally as well. Birds traveling to the evening roosts do so at slightly different times, timing their arrival at 30-60 second intervals, presumably so as not to attract the attention of potential predators. Roost sites are usually high in trees on slightly inclined dead branches. All the birds in the group roost next to each other, touching, and facing the same direction.<ref>Noske, R. (1985) " Huddle-roosting behaviour of the Varied Sittella ''Daphoenositta chrysoptera'' in relation to social status". ''Emu'' '''85''' (3): 188 - 194 </ref>  Amongst Australian birds Varied Sittellas are usually the first to arrive at roost sites in the evening and the last to leave in the morning, although they are not necessarily the first to sleep or last to wake. At the roost site the position occupied along the branch is generally not random; instead males generally adopt positions at the edges of the group whilst young birds tend to be found in the centre. 
===Diet and foraging===
The principal component of the diet of sittellas are insects and other arthropods.<ref name = "HBW/> In one study in new South Wales adult beetles were the most common component of the Varied Sittella's diet, around 36%; particularly favoured were weevils, ladybirds, leaf beetles Chrysomelidae) and click beetles (Elateridae). A further quarter of the diet was composed of spiders and true bugs. Also taken were beetle and moth larvae, grasshoppers, termites, wasps and bees. Ants were taken relatively infrequently compared to other Australasian birds in similar niches. The proportion of any one item in the diet apparently varies geographically and seasonally, for example another study found that beetle larvae composed 87% of the diet. The diet of the Black Sittella has, like other aspects of its biology, been little studied, although the stomach contents of one that were examined contained caterpillars and spiders. 

Sittellas forage on horizontal branches and the trunks of trees. Their foraging techniques has been described as hopping rapidly along the length of a horizontal branch, pausing briefly to peer for prey, occasionally hanging underneath the branch but usually on top of it. Most of the time is spent on branches rather than on the trunks. Birds on the trunks may travel upwards or downwards. Within the forest sittellas usually forage in the canopy. There are sexual differences in foraging, with males and females choosing to forage in slightly different microhabitats within the tree.<ref name = "HBW/> Prey items are usually gleaned directly from the bark, although in a few instances sittellas will sally from the branch in order to snatch aerial prey. Having obtained prey sittellas will use their feet to hold it while they eat it, in a similar manner to parrots, and will also use their feet in order to hold back strips of bark in order to pry underneath it.  There have even been isolated reports of tool use in some populations of sittellas.<ref>Green, C. (1972) [http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&file_id=MU972178.pdf "Use of tools by Orange-winged Sittella".] ''Emu'' '''72''' (4): 185-186 </ref> Sticks were used to pry boring beetle larvae out of cavities, in a similar fashion to that of tool using Woodpecker Finches of the Galapagos.

'''Tulinakkelit''' (''Daphoenositta'') on suku pienenkokoisissa varpuslinnuissa. Niitä löytyy luonnonvaraisina ainoastaan puukiipijöiltä, mutta niillä on lyhyempi pyrstö. Ne eivät ole lintuja, joilla on terävä alaspäin kaartuva nokka, jolla se pystyy kaivamaan hyönteisiä puun kuoren alta. Pesä on kuppimainen ja puussa tai pensaassa. 

Tulinakkeleihin on ennen kuulunut kaksi sukua: ''Daphoenositta'' ja ''Neositta''. ''Neositta''-sukuun kuului australiannakkeli ja papuannakkeli. ''Daphoenositta''-sukuun kuului ainoastaan tulinakkeli. Nykyään suvut on yhdistetty yhdeksi suvuksi ''Daphoenositta''.<ref></ref>
