'''Greenbrier''' is a city in Faulkner County, Little Rock&ndash;North Little Rock&ndash;Conway Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 3,042 at the 2000 census.

== History ==

Greenbrier is a town that developed from saw briers into a bustling city. Many people who have moved to the city of Greenbrier and lived only in a developed area may not be aware of the infamous saw briers. Saw briers are green and prickly when touched. The early pioneers found them to be a nuisance while clearing the land for homes and farms. To reach down and grab a hand full of saw briers would stop a working regimen immediately. It is a good thing for the city that much of this land was homesteaded by pioneers who were tough, hard working, strong willed people. Greenbrier is located 12 miles north of Conway on Highway 65. It is presently a fast growing little city because of its unique location, but it hasn't always been that way. At one time Greenbrier was just a vast countryside.

From the 1500s to around the 1800s the area was just wilderness and territorial land that was home for many Indians. The Quapaw and later the Cherokee Indians, along with famous people like Jim Bowie and Jesse James, were basically all that lived here. Of corse, Jim Bowie and Jesse James were just passing through on their way to the area of Oklahoma and Texas. The real settlers were people like the Wiley brothers that settled near East Fork Cadron, which is about eight miles east of Greenbrier today. They came along around 1818. in 1837, Jonathan Hardin settled near the Wiley settlement. Also, in the early 1800s the Casharago's settled north of Greenbrier in the present community of Republican.
