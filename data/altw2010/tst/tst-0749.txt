'''Operation Trident''' and its follow up '''Operation Python''' were naval attacks launched on minesweeper, which were sunk. Another Pakistani destroyer, PNS ''Shajehan'', was badly damaged. No vessels were lost on the Indian side. The operation was the first battle since independence for the two nations which saw naval ships being sunk.

Following months of civil unrest in neighboring pre emptive air strikes against India. 

===Hitting Karachi===
OSA class Missile boats, escorted by two Anti-submarine patrol vessels. Nearing the Karachi port, they detected Pakistani presence and launched missiles, hitting PNS ''Muhafiz'' and PNS ''Khyber'', which both sank. PNS Shajahan was also severely damaged. The missile boats then hit the fuel storage tanks at Karachi harbour, setting them ablaze.

The success of this operation prompted another attack on Pakistan coast named '''Operation Python''' on the night of December 8 1971. In rough seas a small strike group, consisting of missile boat ''Vinash'' and two multipurpose frigates, approached Karachi. In the ensuing battle, the Indian ships sank the Panamian vessel ''Gulf Star'', while the Pakistan Navy's ''Dacca'' and the British ship SS ''Harmattan'' were badly damaged. The Pakistani fuel reserves for the sector were destroyed. The flames could be seen from 60 miles away. The Pakistan Navy's main ships were destroyed or forced to remain in port. The operations also set the oil storage tanks of Karachi on fire.[http://www.nwc.navy.mil/press/Review/2002/spring/art4-sp2.htm] Shipping traffic to and from Karachi - Pakistan's only major port at that time - ceased. Pakistan attempted to counter the Indian missile boat threat by carrying out bombing raids over Okha harbour – the forward base of the missile boats. The strikes were ineffective as the Indian missile boats had been moved elsewhere anticipating such a move. The Operation was so successful and kept the Pakistan Navy on alert, which raised a false alarm of another missile attack on December 6. PAF planes flew to attack the supposed Indian ship and damaged the vessel before it was identified as one of their own ships. PNS Zulfiqar suffered casualties and damage as a result of this friendly fire.

The result was a crippling economic blow to Pakistan and was one of the factors that prompted Pakistan's surrender to India in a little over 10 days.

Operation Trident was the first time ship launched missiles were used in the region, and saw the first sinking of naval vessels in the region since independence for the two nations. As a result of this operation India celebrates Navy Day on December 4.

'''L'operation Trident''' est une attaque navale lancée par la guerre indo-pakistanaise de 1971. C'est depuis l'indépendance tant de l'Inde que du Pakistan, la première bataille à l'occasion de laquelle des bâtiments de guerre sont coulés. 

==La bataille==
Après des mois de troubles dans le Pakistan de l'est, devenu depuis le Bangladesh, et à la suite de l'opération Chengiz Khan, lancée préventivement contre elle par l'aviation pakistanaise, l'Inde décide d'intervenir militairement le .

Karachi abrite le quartier général de la marine pakistanaise et la majeure partie de ses navires mouillent dans son port. Karachi est aussi le centre du trafic maritime commercial pakistanais et son blocus peut avoir des conséquences économiques désastreuses pour le pays. Très conscient de cette réalité, l'état-major pakistanais a puissamment défendu le port contre des attaques navales ou aériennes éventuelles.

Le 4 décembre, la marine indienne déclenche l'opération Trident contre le port. Trois vedettes lance-missiles de classe Osa, escortées par deux patrouilleurs anti sous-marins attaquent et coulent les navires pakistanais PNS ''Muhafiz'' et PNS ''Khyber'' et endommagent sérieusement le PNS ''Shajahan''. Les vedettes lancent ensuite des missiles contre les installations pétrolières du port qui sont incendiés.
