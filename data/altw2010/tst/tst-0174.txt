The '''Greater Romania Party''' (, PRM) is a Romanian political party, led by Corneliu Vadim Tudor. The party is sometimes referred to in English as the '''Great Romania Party'''.  

It promotes strongly nationalist policies and is seen as the most right-wing of the major Romanian parties. The party's philosophy has often been characterized as xenophobic, anti-ethnic Hungarian, anti-Roma, homophobic, Antisemitic, and irredentist. PRM's rhetoric has also focused extensively on Romania's pervasive problem of high level corruption, a top concern of many average Romanians and an issue that has gained votes for the PRM, even from those who do not wholly agree with the party's strongly nationalistic ideology. 

It briefly participated in government from 1993 to 1995 (in Front National Party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen similarly drew the second largest number of votes and was elevated, but defeated, in the presidential run-off against Jacques Chirac. 

Although Tudor clearly remained the central figure in the PRM, in March 2005 he briefly stepped down from the party presidency in favour of People's Party, which has since merged with the New Generation – Christian Democratic Party.

As of January 2007, with Romania's accession to the E.U., it was reported that România Mare's five National Front and Austrian Freedom Party, giving them sufficient numbers to form an official bloc, called Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty.<ref></ref>

==History and ideology==
The party was founded in ethnic Romanians into a single country; it was briefly achieved between the two World Wars, and is now a rallying cry for Romanian nationalists. Due to internal conditions under Communism after World War II, the expression's use was forbidden in publications until 1990, after the 1989 Romanian Revolution.) 

thumb|right|250px|Greater RomaniaBoth the ideology and the main political focus of the Greater Romania Party are reflected in frequently strongly nationalistic articles written by Tudor. For example, in his magazine there is a permanent column called simply ''Unguri'' ("Hungarians"), in which he fights alleged anti-Romanian conspiracies of the ethnic Hungarian party.  

In 2003, Tudor said he would no longer engage in discourse against philo-Semite". In subsequent months he and some of his supporters traveled to Prime Minister Antisemitic.  Throughout this period, PRM publications continued to include articles that denied the Holocaust in Romania and took deliberately antagonistic positions toward Romanian Roma, ethnic Hungarians, and other minority groups.

Le '''parti de la grande Roumanie''' (en roumain, qui prône le national-communisme et est dirigé par Corneliu Vadim Tudor. 

150px|left|PRMOfficiellement, ce parti se dit être de "centre-gauche" et "chrétien-démocrate". Ainsi son programme économique et social est de type social-démocrate (économie de marché encadrée par l'Etat, protection des couches populaires pauvres, défense des intêrets des artisans et petits commerçants) et la doctrine du parti met aussi l'accent sur des valeures morales traditionelles (la défense de la patrie, la famille, le respect pour la religion et les croyances populaires). En 2004, il tente de rejoindre le Parti populaire européen, mais il se heurte à un refus. Dans la presse, on l'associe parfois à l'extrême-droite roumaine (le parti "Noua Dreapta"-"la Nouvelle Droite"), à cause de la promotion de l'idéee d'une "Grande Roumanie" qui réunirait tous les téritoires peuplés par des roumains, dans les pays voisins (Ukraine, Moldavie, Serbie).
