This is a '''list of movie studios''' that produce pornographic (or "adult") films. In addition to more straightforward sado-masochism (S&M), bondage and discipline (BDSM), anal sex, bukkake, or group sex, for example. There is a wide range of film quality, ranging from amateur films to those with professional, high end production values. 

As with the mainstream purchased or rented online, at "brick and mortar" retail outlets, or through downloads and streaming videos are also becoming more popular with the availability of increased internet access speeds.
 
The list is divided into two sections&mdash;studios producing primarily heterosexual&nbsp;("straight") and lesbian pornography; and those primarily producing homosexual&nbsp;("bisexual&nbsp;("bi") pornography.

==Heterosexual and lesbian ==
'''Heterosexual pornography''' by definition is any Lesbian pornography''' depicts female same-sex activity. Current, widespread definitions in adult films place lesbian porn in the same category as heterosexual porn.
