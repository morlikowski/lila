'''Hastings''' er ein by i East Sussex, søraust i England. Han har rundt 84&nbsp;000 innbyggjarar (2000). Hastings er kjend som ein badeby og  slaget ved Hastings i 1066, då Wilhelm Erobraren og normannarane tok over styret av England. Slaget stod eigentleg ved byen Battle i nærleiken. Hasting var ein av Cinque Ports, fem viktige hamnar i mellomalderen, men blei seinare mindre viktig etter. Hovudindustrien har sidan den tid og fram til no vore fiske.

==Historie==
240px|mini|Kystlina i Hastings.
Wilhelm Erobraren brukte byen som base då han steig i land i England. Då slaget ved Hastings var vunne bydge han ei borg her som ein kan sjå på Bayeuxteppet. Den noverande borga i Hastings er truleg bygd på den opphavlege grunnmuren.

I mellomalderen blei Hastings kalla den viktigaste av ''Cinque Ports'', dei fem hamnebyane. 

På 1200-talet blei store delar av byen teken av sjøen. Han blei overfalt og brunnen av franskmenn i 1339 og 1377, og gjekk deretter inn i ei nedgangstid. Det at Hastings mangla ei naturleg hamn gjorde ikkje stoda betre. Det blei lagt mange planar om å byggja ei hamn for byen, og i 1897 byrja ein eit prosjekt der ein stor «hamnearm» blei laga i sement. Pengemangel førte til at prosjektet aldri blei fullført, og under andre verdskrigen blei store delar av byggverket sprengd for å hindra tyske styrker i å bruka det til å invadera England.

Utviklinga av det engelske jarnbanenettet og badeturisme gjorde likevel at byen vaks på 1800-talet.

'''Hastings''' is a town on the coast of  Borough of the same name. Within the Borough is the satellite town of St Leonards-on-Sea; it includes three originally separate settlements, as well as the inevitable growth of the town through the building of new estates.

In historical terms, Hastings can claim fame through its connection with the Norman conquest of England; and also because it became one of the medieval Cinque Ports. Hastings was, for centuries, an important fishing port; although much reduced, it has the largest beach-based fishing fleet in England. As with many other such places, the town became a watering place in the 1760s, and then, with the coming of the railway, a seaside resort.

The attraction of Hastings as a tourist destination continues; although the numbers of hotels has decreased, it caters for wider tastes, being home to internationally-based cultural and sporting events, such as chess and running. It has set out to become "a modern European town" and seeks to attract commercial business in the many industrial sites round the borough.<ref>[http://www.hastings.gov.uk/business/competitive_hastings.aspx Hastings Borough Council:’’Competitive Hastings’]</ref>

==Etymology==
There are differing views as to the etymology of the name ''Hastings''. The main suggestion appears to be that it could be from the Jutish colony here in the fifth century; Marchant<ref name="marchant"></ref> states that Hastings is the only non-Saxon settlement in Sussex.

==History==
===Early history===
There is evidence of ''prehistoric'' settlements at the site of the town: flint arrowheads and Romans arrived in Britain for the first time in 55&nbsp;BC. At this time they began to exploit the iron (Wealden rocks provide a plentiful supply of the ore), and so the port was useful to them. One of the many local sites where the iron was worked at Beauport Park, to the north of the town, which employed up to one thousand men and is considered to have been the third largest in the Roman Empire.<ref></ref>

With the departure of the Romans the town suffered setbacks. The Beauport site had been abandoned; and natural and man-made attacks began. The Sussex coast has always suffered from occasional violent storms; with the additional hazard of longshore drift (the eastward movement of shingle along the coast) the coastline has been frequently changing. The original Roman port could now well be under the sea.<ref name="marchant"/>

Man-made attacks possibly included the Danish invaders who gave the town its name, with their harbour in the west of the borough. Bulverhythe, where its original site is conjectured, suggests that: ''-hythe'' or ''hithe'' means a port or small haven.<ref></ref> A royal mint in Hastings was established in AD 928 during the reign of Athelstan.<ref></ref>

===Medieval Hastings===
The start of the Norman Conquest was the Battle of Hastings, fought on 14 October 1066; although the battle itself took place eight miles to the north at Senlac Hill, and William had landed on the coast between Hastings and Eastbourne at a site now known as Norman's Bay. It is thought that the Norman encampment was on the town’s outskirts, where there was open ground; a new town was already being built in the valley to the east. That "New Burgh" was founded in 1069, and is mentioned in the Domesday Book as such. William defeated and killed Harold Godwinson, the last Saxon King of England, and destroyed his army; thus opening England to the Norman conquest. 

William caused a castle to be built at Hastings probably using the earthworks of the existing Saxon castle.

Hastings was a shown as a Rape of Hastings, one of the six administrative divisions of Sussex. As a borough, Hastings had a Elizabeth I in 1589 the bailiff was replaced by a mayor.

===Hastings and the sea===
By the end of the Saxon period, the port of Hastings had moved eastward near the present town centre in the Priory Stream valley, whose entrance was protected by the White Rock headland (since demolished). It was to be a short stay: Danish attacks and huge floods in 1011 and 1014 motivated the townspeople to relocate to the New Burgh.

In the Middle Ages Hastings became one of the Sandwich, Hythe followed, all finally being joined by Rye and Winchelsea, at one point 42 towns were directly or indirectly affiliated to the group. 

In the 13th century much of the town was washed away by the sea. During a naval campaign of 1339, and again in 1377, the town was raided and burnt by the French, and seems then to have gone into a decline. As a port, Hastings' days were finished. 

It had suffered over the years from the lack of a natural harbour, and there have been attempts to create a sheltered harbour. Attempts were made to build a stone harbour during the reign of Elizabeth I, but the foundations were destroyed by the sea in terrible storms. The last harbour project began in 1896, but this also failed when structural problems and rising costs 
exhausted all the available funds. Today a fractured sea-wall is all that remains of what might have become a magnificent harbour. In 1897 the foundation stone was laid of a large concrete structure, but there was insufficient money to complete the work and the "Harbour arm" remains uncompleted. It was partially blown up to discourage possible use by German invasion forces during World War II. The fishing boats are still stored on and launched from the beach.

Hastings was now a small fishing village, but it was soon discovered that the new taxes on luxury goods could be made profitable by smuggling, and the town was ideally located for that.<ref>[http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/ Hastings Museum ''Smuggling on the Sussex Coast'']</ref> Near the castle ruins, on the West Hill, are "St Clement's Caves", partly natural, but mainly excavated by hand by the smugglers from the soft sandstone. Their trade was to come to an end with the period following the Napoleonic Wars, for the town became one of the most fashionable resorts in Britain, brought about by the so-called properties of sea-water. Once this came about the expansion of the town took place, to the west, since there was little space left in the valley. 

It was at this time that the elegant Pelham Crescent and Wellington Square were built: other building followed. In the Crescent is the classical style church of St Mary in the Castle (its name recalling the old chapel in the castle above) now in use as an arts centre. The building of the crescent and the church necessitated further cutting away of the castle hill cliffs. Once that move away from the old town had begun, it led to the further expansion along the coast, eventually linking up with the new St Leonards.

==Governance==
Hastings returned two Members of Parliament from the 14th century to 1885 since when it has returned one. 

Hastings, it is thought, was a Saxon town before the arrival of the Normans: the Rapes or administrative districts of Sussex.   

By a Charter of Elizabeth I in 1589 the bailiff was replaced by a mayor, by which time the town's importance was dwindling. In the in 1974, that status was abolished.

Hastings Borough Council is now in the second tier of local government, below electoral wards as shown on the map,<ref>[http://www.hastings.gov.uk/wards/default.aspx Hastings Online - map of ward boundaries]</ref> they are in four areas, as below. Some explanation of the ward names is also given:

==Geography==

</div>
Hastings is situated where the Ore, from which "The Ridge", marking the effective boundary of Hastings, extends north-westwards towards Battle. Beyond Bulverhythe, the western end of Hastings is marked by low-lying land known as Glyne Gap, separating it from Bexhill-on-Sea.

The sandstone cliffs have been the subject of considerable erosion in relatively recent times: much of the Castle was lost to the sea before the present sea defences and promenade were built, and a number of cliff-top houses are in danger of disappearing around the nearby village of Fairlight.

The beach is mainly shingle, although wide areas of sand are uncovered at low tide. The town is generally built upon a series of low hills rising to  above sea level at "The Ridge" before falling back in the river valley further to the north.

The town also has a large Victorian park, Alexandra Park.

Like many coastal towns, the population of Hastings grew significantly as a result of the construction of railway links and the fashionable growth of seaside holidays during the Victorian era. In 1801 its population was a mere 3,175; by 1831 it had reached over ten thousand; by 1891 it was almost sixty thousand, and the 2001 census reported over 85,000 inhabitants.

In the 1930s the town underwent some rejuvenation. Seaside resorts were starting to go out of fashion: Hastings perhaps more than most. The town council set about a huge rebuilding project, among which the promenade was rebuilt; and an Olympic-size bathing pool was erected. The latter, regarded in its day as one of the best open-air swimming and diving complexes in Europe, closed some years ago. The area is still known by locals as "The Bathing Pool".<ref>[http://www.seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html ''Seaside History: the Bathing Pool at Hastings and St Leonards'']</ref>

==Demography==
Hastings suffers at a disadvantage insofar as growth is concerned because of its restricted situation, lying as it does with the High Weald  Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to the north. Redevelopment of the area is partly hampered by the split administration of the combined Hastings and Bexhill economic region between Hastings and Rother district councils. There is little space for further large-scale housing and employment growth. Most of the jobs within the Borough are concentrated on health, public services, retail and education. 85% of the firms (in 2005) employed fewer than 10 people; as a consequence the unemployment rate was 3.3% (''cf.'' East Sussex 1.7%); and almost one-third of the employable population had no skills at all in 2001.<ref>[http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:pGSq1AuoTgkJ:www.hastings.gov.uk/ldf/amr.pdf+Hastings+populationstatistics&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=5&gl=uk Hastings On-line]</ref>

This situation has now become the subject of parliamentary consideration,<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/35113.htm House of Commons Select Committee: Stakeholders in Hastings 2006]</ref> and regeneration of the Borough is now being considered at that level. From being the third tourist resort in the country 50 years ago, Hastings has still not been able to shake off its over-reliance on tourism. Urban regeneration was deemed essential: too many of the buildings once used as hotels are still unfit for modern use; many of them are now refugee accommodation. There is a lack of highly-skilled job opportunities, and education standards are low, although the new college may help to ameliorate that. In addition Hastings has the highest proportion of elderly people in the UK.

==Economy==
thumb|right|Two of Hastings' beach-launched fishing fleet with part of Old Town and East Cliff Railway in background
Until the development of tourism, fishing was Hastings' major industry. The beach launched fishing fleet, based at the Stade<ref></ref> remains Europe's largest and has recently won accreditation for its sustainable methods. The fleet has been based on the same beach, below the cliffs at Hastings, for at least 400, possibly 600, years. Its longevity attributed to the prolific fishing ground of Rye Bay nearby.<ref></ref>

Hastings fishing vessels are registered at Rye, and thus bear the letters "RX" ('''R'''ye,Susse'''X''').

thumb|left|Net "shops"
On the beach near the Old Town are the so-called "net shops", said to be unique to Hastings, but similar buildings can be found in Whitby &ndash; these are wooden constructions, weatherboarded and tarred, of various shapes and sizes, used for storage. The buildings were built tall and narrow to avoid payment of ground tax. They were never used for net drying; this is a popular misconception: nets were dried on the beach or on the piece of land known as the Minnis. The net huts are covered with traditional "clinker" weather-boarding and most of them measure about 25 feet in height by 8 feet square. 

During the past 150 years, many net huts have been destroyed by stormy seas, and in the 1950s some of them were demolished by the Hastings Council as part of a clearance scheme for development of the beach. About forty-five of these unique structures still survive and are regularly maintained.
