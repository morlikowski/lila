Стойността на сградата е 1,7 млрд. долара.
Зданието е облицовано със стъкло и алуминий, поддържано от 380 бетонни опори, които влизат на 80 метра в земята. Опасността от урагани и земетресения е намалена от огромен глобус-маховик, намиращ се между 87 и 91 етаж. По изчисления на инженерите сградата може да издържи на външни влияния и колебания 2500 години.

На 25 декември 2004 година, сградата е покорена от "Човека-паяк" -  Ален Робер. Височината е покорена за около 4 часа, като отначало той планира да я покори за 2 часа.

'''Taipei 101''' (; world's tallest completed skyscraper. Taipei 101 received the Emporis Skyscraper Award in 2004. It has been hailed as one of the Seven New Wonders of the World (''Newsweek'' magazine, 2006) and Seven Wonders of Engineering (Discovery Channel, 2005).<ref name="Awards">[http://www.taipei-101.com.tw/tower/event/award.asp Taipei 101 Official Website - Awards]</ref>

The building stands as an icon of Taipei and Taiwan as a whole. The building contains 101 floors above ground and 5 floors underground. Its postmodern style combines tradition and modernity in ways that appear simultaneously Asian and international. Its safety features enable it to withstand typhoons and earthquakes. A multi-level shopping mall adjoining the tower houses hundreds of fashionable stores, restaurants and clubs. Fireworks launched from Taipei 101 feature prominently in international New Year's Eve broadcasts, and the landmark appears frequently in films, television shows, print publications, anime media, games, and other elements of popular culture. 

The name of the tower reflects its location in Taipei's international business district (101 mailing code) as well as its floor count. (See also ''"Symbolism"'' below.) The number is pronounced in English simply as ''One Oh One'' and in Mandarin and other local languages by the equivalent. 

Taipei 101 is owned by the USA. The name originally planned for the building, '''Taipei World Financial Center''', was derived from the name of the owner. The original name in Chinese was literally, ''Taipei International Financial Center'' (''). 

Taipei 101 was overtaken in height on UAE, upon the completion of that building's 141st floor.<ref name="dubaimegaprojects.com">  </ref> The title of "world's tallest building" still rests with Taipei 101, though, as international architectural standards define a "building" as a structure capable of being fully occupied. The Burj Dubai is on course to claim the title once its construction is finished, expected in September 2009.

Taipei 101 has 101 stories above ground and five underground. Upon its completion Taipei 101 claimed the official records for:
* ''Ground to highest architectural structure (spire):'' . Previously held by the Petronas Towers .
* ''Ground to roof:'' . Formerly held by the Sears Tower .
* ''Ground to highest occupied floor:'' . Formerly held by the Sears Tower .
* ''Fastest ascending elevator speed:''  (60.6 km/h, 37.7 mi/h). 
* ''Largest countdown clock:'' On display every New Year's Eve.

The record for greatest height from ground to pinnacle remained with the Sears Tower in Chicago (USA): .

thumb|left|180px| Taipei 101 endures a [[typhoon]]The UAE, overtook Taipei 101 in height upon completion of its 141st floor on July 7, 2007. The Burj Dubai is expected to hold a number of world records by the time it opens in mid-2009. Taipei 101 retains its official title until the Burj Dubai is completed, however, as the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat does not officially recognize a structure as a "building" for record purposes until it is functional--that is, until it is completed and can be occupied.

Various sources, including the building's owners,<ref name="Awards"/> give the height of Taipei 101 as , roof height and top floor height as  and . This lower figure is derived by measuring from the top of a  platform at the base. CTBUH standards, though, include the height of the platform in calculating the overall height, as it represents part of the man-made structure and is above the level of the surrounding pavement.<ref>http://www.ctbuh.org/Default.aspx?tabid=93 CTBUH - current criteria for determining the World's Tallest Buildings</ref><ref>[http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:wygMH1RAhgAJ:www.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-10-08-taiwan_x.htm+taipei+101+height+dispute&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=5 USAToday - Paragraph abstract: ''the council measures from the sidewalk level of the main entrance to the skyscraper's architectural top'']</ref>

===Construction===

Taipei 101 is designed to withstand the typhoon winds and earthquake tremors common in its area of the Asia-Pacific. Planners aimed for a structure that could withstand gale winds of  per second (216 km/h, 134 mi/h) and the strongest earthquakes likely to occur in a 2,500 year cycle.<ref name=brochure>Observatory brochure, Floor 89, Taipei 101. 2007-08-17.</ref>

Skyscrapers must be flexible in strong winds yet remain rigid enough to prevent large sideways movement (lateral drift). Flexibility prevents structural damage while resistance ensures comfort for the occupants and protection of glass, curtain walls and other features. Most designs achieve the necessary strength by enlarging critical structural elements such as bracing. The extraordinary height of Taipei 101 combined with the demands of its environment called for additional innovations on the part of engineers.

The design achieves both strength and flexibility for the tower through the use of high-performance steel construction. Thirty-six columns support Taipei 101, including eight "mega-columns" packed with 10,000-psi concrete.<ref name=Floor89PPM>Publicly posted material, Floor 89, Taipei 101. 2007-08-17.</ref> Every eight floors, outrigger trusses connect the columns in the building’s core to those on the exterior.

These features combine with the solidity of its foundation to make Taipei 101 one of the most stable buildings ever constructed. The foundation is reinforced by 380 piles driven  into the ground, extending as far as  into the bedrock. Each pile is  in diameter and can bear a load of  - .<ref name=Floor89PPM/> The stability of the design became evident during construction when, on March 31 2002, a 6.8-magnitude earthquake rocked Taipei. The tremor was strong enough to topple two construction cranes from the 56th floor, then the highest, and killed five people in the accident. An inspection afterwards showed no structural damage to the building and construction soon resumed.

Thornton-Tomasetti Engineers along with Evergreen Consulting Engineering designed a <ref>[http://www.taipei-101.com.tw/en/OB/about/damper.asp Taipei 101 Official Website - Observatory Servicing Facilities]</ref> steel pendulum that serves as a tuned mass damper, the cost for it is NT$132 million (US$4 million).<ref name="Tuned Mass Damper">[http://www.taipei-101.com.tw/ch/OB/about/damper.asp Tuned Mass Damper], Taipei 101 Official Website</ref> Suspended from the 92nd to the 88th floor, the pendulum sways to offset movements in the building caused by strong gusts.

===Symbolism===
left|thumb|180px| [[Ruyi figure over a Taipei 101 entrance]]Taipei 101, like all spire structures, participates in the symbolism of the  ''axis mundi'': a world center where earth and sky meet and the four compass directions join.

The height of 101 floors commemorates the renewal of time: the new century that arrived as the tower was built (100+1) and all the new years that follow (1-01). It symbolizes high ideals by going one better on 100, a traditional number of perfection. It represents the spot where the tower stands: 101 is the postal code of Taipei's international business district. The number also evokes the binary numeral system used in digital technology.<ref name=Floor89PPM/>

The main tower features a series of eight segments of eight floors each. In Chinese-speaking cultures the number eight is associated with abundance, prosperity and good fortune. In cultures that observe a seven-day week the number eight symbolizes a renewal of time (7+1). In digital technology the number eight is associated with the byte, the basic unit of information. 

The repeated segments simultaneously recall the rhythms of an Asian pagoda (a tower linking earth and sky, also evoked in the Petronas Towers), a stalk of bamboo (an icon of learning and growth), and a stack of ancient Chinese ingots or money boxes (a symbol of abundance). The four discs mounted on each face of the building where the pedestal meets the tower represent coins. The emblem placed over entrances shows three gold coins of ancient design with central holes shaped to imply the Arabic numerals ''1-0-1''.<ref name=Floor89PPM/>

Curled ''motif. The ruyi, is an ancient symbol associated with heavenly clouds. It connotes healing, protection and fulfilment. It appears in celebrations of the attainment of new career heights.<ref>http://www.fengshuibestbuy.com/ruyi1.html The symbolism of a Ru Yi Symbol</ref> Each ruyi ornament on the exterior of the Taipei 101 tower stands at least  tall. The sweeping curved roof of the adjoining mall culminates in a colossal ruyi that shades pedestrians. Though the shape of each ruyi at Taipei 101 is traditional, its metallic interpretation is plainly modern.

At night the bright yellow gleam from its pinnacle casts Taipei 101 in the role of a candle or torch upholding the ideals of liberty and welcome. From 6:00 to 10:00 each evening<ref>[http://www.taipei-101.com.tw/en/Tower/event/light.asp Taipei 101 Official Website - Lights Schedule]</ref> the tower's lights display one of seven colours in the spectrum. The colours coincide with the days of the week:

The cycle through the spectrum connects the tower with the rich symbolism of rainbows, traditionally seen as bridges linking earth to sky and earth's peoples to one another. 

A further connection with time appears in an adjoining park, where a clock draws its energy entirely from the building's wind shear. The circular shape of the clock is echoed in the shape of the park itself.
 
left|thumb|280px| ''[[Feng shui'' fountain outside Taipei 101]]Taipei 101, like many of its neighbours, shows the influence of ''ch'i'', from a building and its occupants. Flowing water placed at such a spot can remedy the situation by generating a positive inward flow of ''ch'i''. At Taipei 101 a traditional predicament has been addressed with a traditional solution--yet the result looks modern.

Taipei 101 merges ancient motifs and ideas with modern techniques and materials. As a landmark it renews the symbolism of all tall towers as cosmic centers. Its interplaying symbols convey images of optimism, abundance, and awareness of the cycles of time.

Taipei 101 is the first record-setting skyscraper to be constructed in the twenty-first century. Appropriately it exhibits a number of technologically advanced features as it provides a center for business and recreation. 

The original 2004 satellite Internet connections enabled transfer speeds up to a gigabyte per second.

The doubledeck elevators built by Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems Corporation (TELC) set a new record in 2004 with top ascending speeds of  per second (60.6 km/h, 37.7 mi/h). This speed is 34.7 percent faster than the previous record holders of the Yokohama Landmark Tower elevator, Yokohama, Japan, which speeds of  per second (45.0 km/h, 28.0 mi/h). Taipei 101's elevators sweep visitors from the fifth floor to the 89th-floor observatory in only 37 seconds.<ref>[http://www.taipei-101.com.tw/en/OB/about/floor.asp Taipei 101 Official Website - Observatory Floor Guide]</ref> Each elevator features an aerodynamic body, full pressurization, state-of-the art emergency braking systems, and the world's first triple-stage anti-overshooting system.

The 101st floor is home to a private club named Summit 101. No information about this club has been made public save for a reference in the observatory pamphlet. 

The observatories are located in the 91st and 89th floors. (See "Observatories" below.)

Two restaurants have opened on the 85th floor: Diamond Tony's, which offers European-style seafood and steak, and Shin Yeh 101 (欣葉), which offers Taiwanese-style cuisine. Occupying all of the 86th floor is Japanese restaurant XEX. <ref name="85F Restaurant">[http://www.taipei-101.com.tw/en/tower/restaurant/85f.asp Taipei 101 Official Website - 85F Restaurant<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The multi-story retail mall adjoining the tower is home to hundreds of fashionable stores, restaurants, clubs and other attractions. The mall's interior is modern in design even as it makes use of traditional elements. The curled ''Exterior symbolism" above) is a recurring motif inside the mall. Many features of the interior also observe ''feng shui'' traditions.

===Observatories===
Taipei 101 features an Indoor Observatory (89 F) and an Outdoor Observatory (91 F).<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2005/12/09/2003283682 Taipei Times - archives<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Both offer 360-degree views and attract visitors from around the world.
*The Indoor Observatory stands <!--382.2 m (1,254 ft) and 1.2 m (4 ft) base--> above ground and can be reached by the fastest elevator in the world (at 1010 meters per minute) from the shopping mall fifth floor - takes only 37 seconds to arrive the 89th floor. It offers visitors a comfortable indoor environment, large windows with UV protection, recorded voice tours in seven languages, informative displays and special exhibits. Here one may view the skyscraper's main damper, nicknamed "Damper Baby", and buy food, drinks and gift items.
