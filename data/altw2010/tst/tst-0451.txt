==Background==

In 1940, during Labour Party had entered into a coalition with the Conservative Party. On 10 June, 1941 Arthur Greenwood, the Labour MP and Minister without Portfolio, had announced the creation of an inter-departmental committee which would carry out a survey of Britain's social insurance and allied services. Its terms of reference were:

<blockquote>To undertake, with special reference to the inter-relation of the schemes, a survey of the existing national schemes of social insurance and allied services, including workmen's compensation, and to make recommendations.</blockquote>

Its members were civil servants from the Ministry of Health, HM Treasury, Reconstruction Secretariat, Board of Customs and Excise, Assistance Board, Department of Health for Scotland, Registry of Friendly Societies and Office of the Industrial Assurance Commissioner.

==The Report==

The Report offered three guiding principles to its recommendations:

1. Proposals for the future should not limited by "sectional interests" in learning from experience and that a "revolutionary moment in the world's history is a time for revolutions, not for patching".

2. Social insurance is only one part of a "comprehensive policy of social progress". The five giants on the road to reconstruction were Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness.

3. Policies of social security "must be achieved by co-operation between the State and the individual", with the state securing the service and contributions. The state " should not stifle incentive, opportunity, responsibility; in establishing a national minimum, it should leave room and encouragement for voluntary action by each individual to provide more than that minimum for himself and his family".

==Reaction==

Inside the Cabinet there was debate, instigated by Brendan Bracken, on 16 November 1942 over whether to publish the Report as a White Paper at that time. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Kingsley Wood, believed the Report to be "ambitious and involv[ing] an impracticable financial commitment" and therefore publication should be postponed. However the Cabinet decided on 26 November to publish it on 2 December.<ref>Correlli Barnett, ''The Audit of War'' (Pan, 2001), pp. 26-27.</ref>

'''ベヴァリッジ報告書'''（Beveridge Report）とは、ウィリアム・ベヴァリッジが示した社会保障制度拡充のための一連の報告。第二次世界大戦後のイギリスにおける社会保障制度の土台となった。

第二次世界大戦中の1941年、労働組合会議の請願を契機として省間委員会が組織され、国民健康保険制度などについての検討が行われた。その検討に基づいて1942年に示されたものがベヴァリッジ報告である。報告の中で、健康保険・失業保険・年金などを、あらゆる国民がその対象になるような統一制度のもとで整備することが示された。この報告は国民の関心を強く集め、第二次世界大戦後における福祉国家への期待を抱かせた。

第二次世界大戦末の選挙において労働党が大勝し、アトリー労働党政権が成立したことは、この構想を実現へと向かわせた。1946年に国民保険法、国民保険サーヴィス法などが制定され、いわゆる「ゆりかごから墓場まで」といわれるような福祉国家への道を歩んでいった。
