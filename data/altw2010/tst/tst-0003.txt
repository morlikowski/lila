'''長頸駝'''（小獵犬號之旅中發現。長頸駝的外觀就像沒有駝峰及有一個短象鼻的駱駝，但牠們與駱駝或長鼻目沒有親密的關係。

==歷史==
長頸駝的化石紀錄在7百萬年前的南美洲出現。估計長頸駝是從''Theosodon''或''Promacrauchenia''演化而來。南蹄目及滑距骨目是唯一兩個出沒於南美洲的有蹄動物。很多物種因北美洲物種的入侵而在爭競中被淘汰滅絕。只有餘下長頸駝及''Windhausenia''，並大型的箭齒獸屬及''Mixotoxodon''。這些最後的南美洲原住有蹄動物最終與其他來自北美洲的物種在更新世末滅絕。

==解剖==
長頸駝的特徵在於其鼻孔是在頭頂，令一些科學家相信像鯨魚般是用作呼吸管。但有一項研究發現長頸駝有非常好的運動性，可以在奔跑時改變方向。明顯從來沒有人見過長頸駝，牠們的毛皮顏色都只是估計。大部份科學家都傾向相信長頸駝生活在大草原的環境，而估計牠們的毛皮與乾草的顏色接近。

長頸駝與其近親的''Theosodon''一樣，都有完整的44顆牙齒。

==飲食及行為==
按照長頸駝的牙齒，牠們是草食性的，以其象鼻來抓樹葉或草為食物。有推測指牠們是群居的，以逃避獵食者。

'''''Macrauchenia''''' (literally "Big Neck") was a long-necked and long-limbed, three-toed trunk, though it is not closely related to either camels or proboscideans.  

==History==

''Macrauchenia'' appeared in the fossil record some 7 million years ago in South America (in the Miocene epoch). It is likely that ''Macrauchenia'' arose from either ''Theosodon'' or ''Promacrauchenia''. Notoungulata and Litopterna were two ancient orders of ungulates which only occurred in South America. Many of these species became extinct through competition with invading North American ungulates during the Great American Interchange, after the establishment of the Central American land bridge. A few survivors of this invasion were the litopterns ''Macrauchenia'' and ''Windhausenia'' and the large notungulates ''Toxodon'' and ''Mixotoxodon''. These last original South American hoofed animals died out eventually at the end of the Pleistocene, along with numerous other large animals on the American continent (such as American elephants, horses, camels, saber-toothed cats and ground sloths). As this genus was the last of the litopterns, its extinction ended that line of mammals.

==Anatomy==
One striking characteristic of ''Macrauchenia'' is that, unlike most other mammals, the openings for nostrils on its skull were atop the head, leading some early scientists to believe that, much like a whale, it used these nostrils as a form of snorkel. Soon after some more recent findings, this theory was rejected. One insight into ''Macrauchenia'''s physiology is that it apparently had unusually good mobility, being able to rapidly change direction when it ran. It is speculated that since ''Macrauchenia'' lived in an environment much like the savannas of modern-day Africa, it may have had a tawny coat to match the color of dried grass.

''Macrauchenia'' is known, like its relative, ''Theosodon'', to have had a full set of 44 teeth.

==Diet and behavior==

''Macrauchenia'' was an herbivore, likely living on leaves from trees or grasses. Scientists believe that, because of the forms of its teeth, it ate using its trunk to grasp leaves and other food.  It is also believed that it lived in herds like modern-day wildebeest or antelope, the better to escape predators.

==Predators==
When ''Macrauchenia'' first arose, it would have been preyed upon by the largest of native South American predators, terror birds such as ''Andalgalornis'', and carnivorous marsupials such as ''Thylacosmilus'' and ''Borhyaena''.  During the late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene, the Panama Isthmus formed, allowing predators of North American origin, such as the puma, the jaguar and the saber-toothed cat, ''Smilodon populator'', to emigrate into South America and replace the native forms.
