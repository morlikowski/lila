'''''The Dance''''' is a live performance by the band 1997, and later on Rumours'', ''The Dance'' renewed public interest in the band, which had by that time had fallen into relative obscurity. It was also the first Fleetwood Mac release to top the US album charts since 1982's ''Mirage''. This line-up (without Christine McVie) would later go on to record the 2003 studio album ''Say You Will''.
The concert was recorded on a soundstage in University of Southern California Marching Band who perform on the tracks "Tusk" (having played on the original studio recording) and "Don't Stop". 

Although predominantly a live greatest hits package, "The Dance" also features new material written by each of the primary songwriting members of the band (two from Buckingham) as well as popular album tracks. 

Debuting at #1 in the Billboard 200, ''The Dance'' became the 5th best-selling live album of all time in the United States, with over 5 million copies sold there.
