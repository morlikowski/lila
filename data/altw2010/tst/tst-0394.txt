The '''Principality of Reuss Junior Line''' () was a state in Lobenstein, of Ebersdorf, became princes in 1806, and its members bore the title ''Prince Reuss, Younger Line'', though they are also referred to by their branch names (e.g. Prince Reuss of Köstriz). 

The house is unusual for its system of naming and numbering the male members of the family, every one of which has been named "Heinrich" for centuries.  While most royal and noble houses give numbers only to the reigning head of the house, and that in the order of his reign,  the Reuss Junior Line used a numbering sequence for all male family members which began and ended roughly as centuries began and ended. A consequence of this naming system is that certain heads of the Reuss Younger Line have had the highest numbers attached to their name of all the European nobility.  Note also that the male children within a single nuclear family are not numbered sequentially, as all members of the larger family are part of the same numbering system.  For example, the sons of Prince Heinrich LXVII Reuss of Schleiz were, in order, Heinrich V, Heinrich VIII, Heinrich XI, Heinrich XIV, and Heinrich XVI.  

The Principality of Reuss Younger Line had an area of 827 km² and a population of 145,000 in 1905. Its capital was Augusta, the maternal grandmother of Queen Victoria. 

In the aftermath of Elder Line in 1919 as the Republic of Reuss, which was incorporated into the new state of Thuringia in 1919.
