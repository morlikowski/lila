'''Bushwacker''' est un super-vilain créé par Marvel Comics. Il est apparu pour la première fois dans ''Daredevil #249'', en 1987.

==Origine==

Carl Burbank était prêtre lorsqu'il perdit la foi, après que certains de ses paroissiens décédèrent par overdose. Il fut recruté par la CIA, fut équipé d'un bras cybernétique et devint l'agent spécial Bushwacker.

Il commença à mépriser les mutants et à les traquer, surtout ceux qui avaient des pouvoirs liés aux arts. Il rentra alors en conflit avec Wolverine et Daredevil. Wolverine, mutant lui-même, commença à traquer le chasseur, tandis que Marilyn Rogers, la femme de Burbank, demandait l'aide de Daredevil, car son mari devait aller à l'asile. Daredevil empêcha Wolverine de le tuer, mais Bushwacker réussit à s'enfuir et à continuer sa série de meurtres. Finalement, il fut vaincu par les deux héros, le visage à moitié brûlé, et emprisonné.

À sa sortie de prison, il s'associa avec Mary Typhoid pour se venger de Daredevil.

Il travailla par la suite pour Punisher. Quand sa femme le quitta, il travailla pour un trafiquant de drogue qui lui demanda de tuer le reporter Ben Urich. Mais Burbank laissa le journaliste révéler les activités illégales du caid. Il fut toutefois emprisonné. A sa sortie, il excécuta son employeur.

'''Bushwacker''' ('''Carl Burbank''') is a universe who is primarily an enemy of Daredevil, although he has had dealings with The Punisher and Wolverine.  He first appeared in ''Daredevil'' #248.

==Fictional character biography==
Originally a priest, Carl Burbank abandoned his vows following the drug-related deaths of young parishioners. He joined the C.I.A., which outfitted him with a cybernetic arm and made him an assassin under the codename Bushwacker, but ultimately he became a freelancer.

At some point, an event took place that compelled Bushwacker to begin a war against all mutants. Bushwacker began hunting and assassinating mutants, most often those mutants whose abilities Bushwacker perceived as making them especially talented in the arts. (Bushwacker also claimed that he was paid large sums of money to kill mutants, but this has yet to be verified.) Burbank's killing spree brought him into conflict with both Wolverine and Daredevil. Wolverine learned of Bushwacker's activities and began to hunt the killer himself. At the same time, Bushwacker's wife Marilyn believed her husband was insane and needed to be placed in a hospital. She sought aid from lawyer Matt Murdock (secretly the hero Daredevil). Daredevil found Wolverine fighting Bushwacker, and he would have killed him if Daredevil hadn’t stopped him. Unfortunately, this allowed Bushwacker to escape and continue his rampage. Bushwacker was ultimately tracked down and defeated by the two heroes, which left the right side of his face horribly scarred, and he was placed in police custody.<ref>''Daredevil'' #249</ref>

Later, Bushwacker joined with Typhoid Mary and other Daredevil-foes in a plan to beat up their common enemy. After the completion of the plan, Mary took Daredevil's body, and Bushwacker was left to his own activities.<ref>''Daredevil'' #259-260</ref>

Entering the Kingpin's employ, Burbank attacked the Punisher but was left for dead. It was during this time that his wife finally left him.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #12-13</ref> He reappeared in the employ of drug lord Nick Lambert who hired Bushwacker to kill reporter Deathlok II from captivity by Mecha Doom.<ref>''Deathlok'' #5</ref>

Subsequent jobs brought him into conflict with Daredevil, Nomad, the Punisher, Boomerang, and Elektra. His run-in with Nomad, in particular, was over the life of a young baby that Nomad had taken under his care. The baby was the daughter of Troy Donohue, Burbank's ex-brother-in-law, and Bushwacker hoped was that his wife would approve of the rescue and welcome him back.
===Raft/Civil War===
Imprisoned in villan holding facillity the Raft, Burbank escapes during the mass breakout engineered by Electro. Burbank is subsequently employed by the Jackal to kill the Punisher, but he is defeated once again by Daredevil. Afterward, Bushwacker creates a disturbance downtown and took a girl hostage to lure the Punisher out of hiding and kill him. The Punisher shows up as expected but Bushwacker is defeated by S.H.I.E.L.D. operative G. W. Bridge and put back in jail.

===Hood===
The Hood has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act. He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange.
