==Race== 

thumb|left|[[Michael Schumacher leads brother Ralf during the first part of the race.]]

This race created history for it was the first time two brothers finished first and second in a race.

This time Michael Schumacher was out-raced by his younger brother Ralf who had a much more powerful car for this race.

However with Michael finishing second it only strengthened his championship lead after his nearest challenger David Coulthard retired with mechanical problems.

It was a thrilling battle between the two brothers, Michael lead away at the start, but there was problems behind when Fisichella broke his suspension on the back of his team-mate, then Eddie Irvine clashed with Nick Heidfeld, both were out.

Then about 20 laps into the race Montoya crashed into the wall and Barrichello also crashed trying to avoid him, his traction control wasn't working which didn't help, this brought out the safety car briefly while the wreck was cleared.

The race was decided when Ralf Schumacher drove a series of stunning laps after Michael had pitted, so when Ralf came in he was a long way ahead.

Ralf Schumacher cruised home to take his second win of the season with his brother Michael Schumacher coming home second, history was made, it was a first podium of the season for double world champion Mika Häkkinen who benefitted from the high amount of retirements, it was still a subdued flying finn though.
