'''Enrico Fermi''', 29 Eylül 1901 Roma'da doğdu, 28 Kasım 1954 Chicago'da öldü, İtalyan fizikçi. 1938 Nobel Fizik Ödülü sahibi.

Babası polis şefi Alberto Fermidir. İlk olarak dilbilgisi okuluna kaydoldu.Onun ilk matematik ve fiziğe olan yeteneğini keşfeden ve destekleyen babasının arkadaşlarından A. Amidei olmuştur. 

1918'de Pisa Üniversitesinin bursunu kazandı. Pisa Üniversite'sinde 4 yıl kaldıktan sonra 1922'de professör Puccianti'den doktorasını aldı. 

Bir yıl sonra Leyden'e Paul Ehrenfest'le birlikte çalışmaya gitti. Aynı yıl Floransa Üniversitesi'nde matematiksel fizik dersleri vermek için İtalya'ya gitti. 

1926'da Fermi günümüzde Fermi istatistiği olarak bilinen Pauli parçaçıklarının istatistiğini keşfetti. bozomların tersine, bu parçacıklar fermion olarak bilinir. 1927'de Fermi, Roma Üniversitesi'nde teorik fizik profesörü oldu. Bu görevini, Nobel ödülünü aldıktan hemen sonra, 1938'de Mussolini'nin faşist diktatörlüğünden kaçıp Amerika'ya göç edinceye kadar sürdürdü.

Roma'daki ilk yıllarında kendini elektromanyetik problemlerin çözümüne ve bazı Joliot'un yapay radyasyonu keşfinden sonra nötron bombardımanına tutulan aşağı yukarı her elementin nükleer dönüşüme tabi olduğunu keşfetti. Bu araştırma, yavaş nötronların ve periyodik tabloda bilinen elementlerden farklı elementlerin bulunmasına yol açtı. 

Hahn ve Strassmann'ın 1939'un başlarında füzyon'u keşfinden sonra ikincil nötronların yayılma ve zincirleme reaksiyon olasılığını hesapladı. Bu çalışmalarına büyük bir istekle devam etti ve birçok deneyden sonra kontrol altındaki ilk zincirleme reaksiyonu gerçekleştirdi. Bundan sonra atom bombası yapımındaki sorunların aşılmasında önemli rol oynadı, Manhattan Projesi liderlerinden biriydi. 

II. Dünya Savaşı'ndan sonra 1954'de ölümüne kadar sürecek olan nükleer çalışmaları için Chicago Üniversitesi'nden profesörlük teklifini kabul etti. Burada yoğunluğunu yüksek enerji fiziğine verdi ve pion-nucleon etkileşimi çalışmalarına öncülük etti. Yaşamının son yıllarında Fermi kozmik ışınların kaynağını araştırmakla geçirdi. Sonunda kozmik ışınların çok büyük enerji kaynakları olduğunu gösteren bir teori geliştirdi. 

Söz konusu tertip nötronları, termik hızlarla yavaşlatan grafit blokları ile bir araya getirilmiş uranyum içerecek şekilde Chicago Üniversitesi'nin bahçesinde kurulmuştur. Nötronları soğurmak ve böylece reaksiyonun hızını kontrol etmek amacıyla, atom piline kadmiyum çubuklar yerleştirildi. Kadmiyum çubuklar yavaş yavaş çekildi ve kendi kendine devam eden zincir reaksiyon gözlendi. Ferminin bu başarısı, dünyada ilk nükleer reaktörün imali ve atom çağının başlangıcı olmuştur. Fermi 53 yaşında iken kanserden öldü. Bir yıl sonra yüzüncü element keşfedildi ve kendisinin onuruna bu element fermiyum olarak adlandırıldı. 

Ona Nobel ödülü yavaş nötronların yarattığı radyasyon ve nükleer enerji alanındaki çalışmalarından dolayı verildi. Fermi Laura Capon ile 1928'de evlendi. Giulio adında bir oğlu Nella adında bir kızı vardır. Boş zamanlarında yürümeyi, tırmanmayı ve kış sporlarını severdi. 29 kasım 1954'de Chicago'da öldü.

==Biography==
===Physics in Rome===
Enrico Fermi was born in Rome, Italy.   His father was Alberto Fermi, a Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Communications, and his mother was Ida de Gattis, an elementary school teacher. As a young boy he enjoyed learning physics and mathematics and shared his interests with his older brother, Giulio. When Giulio died unexpectedly of a throat abscess in 1915, Enrico was distraught, and immersed himself into scientific study to distract himself. According to his own account, each day he would walk in front of the hospital where Giulio died until he became inured to the pain. Later, Enrico befriended another scientifically inclined student  named Enrico Persico, and the two together engaged in scientific projects such as building gyroscopes, and measuring the magnetic field of the earth. Fermi's interest in physics was further encouraged when a friend of his father's gave him several books on physics and mathematics, which he read and assimilated.

Fermi received his undergraduate and doctoral degree from the partial differential equation for waves on a string. The examiner interviewed Fermi and concluded that his essay would have been commendable even for a doctoral degree. At the Scuola Normale Superiore, Fermi teamed up with a fellow student named Franco Rasetti with whom he used to indulge in light hearted pranks. Later, Rasetti became Fermi's close friend and collaborator.

Fermi's Ph.D advisor was Luigi Puccianti. In 1924 Fermi spent a semester in Göttingen, and then stayed for a few months in Leiden with Paul Ehrenfest.
From January 1925 to the autumn of 1926 he stayed at the Rome (the first for Orso Mario Corbino, director of the Institute of Physics). Corbino helped Fermi in selecting his team, which soon was joined by notable minds like Edoardo Amaldi, Bruno Pontecorvo, Franco Rasetti and Emilio Segrè. For the theoretical studies only, Ettore Majorana also took part in what was soon nicknamed "the Via Panisperna boys" (after the name of the road in which the Institute had its labs).
The group went on with its now famous experiments, but in 1933 Rasetti left Italy for Canada and the United States, Pontecorvo went to France and Segrè left to teach in Palermo.

During their time in Rome, Fermi and his group made important contributions to many practical and theoretical aspects of physics. Some of these include the theory of beta decay, and the discovery of slow neutrons, which was to prove pivotal for the working of nuclear reactors. His group also systematically bombarded elements with slow neutrons, and during their experiments with uranium, narrowly missed observing nuclear fission. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable, if not impossible, mostly on theoretical grounds. While people expected elements with higher atomic number to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements, nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to actually split a heavier atom into two light element fragments. However, the chemist Ida Noddack had criticised Fermi's work and had suggested that some of his experiments could have produced lighter elements. At the time, Fermi dismissed this possibility on the basis of calculations.

Fermi was well-known for his simplicity in solving problems<ref>{{cite book 
  | author = Richard Rhodes
  | title = The Making of the Atomic Bomb
  | date = 1986

His abilities as the greatest combined theoretical and applied nuclear physicist of all time were acknowledged by and influenced many physicists who worked with him, such as Hans Bethe, who spent two semesters working with Fermi in the early 1930s. From the time he was a boy, Fermi meticulously recorded his calculations in notebooks, and later used to solve many new problems that he encountered based on these earlier known problems.

When Fermi submitted his famous paper on Nature'', the journal's editor turned it down because "it contained speculations which were too remote from reality". Thus, Fermi saw the theory published in Italian and in German before it was published in English. ''Nature'' eventually did publish Fermi's report on beta decay on January 16, 1939.

==The Manhattan Project==

Fermi remained in Rome until 1938.

In 1938, Fermi won the Nobel Prize in Physics at the age of 37 for his "demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons".

After Fermi received the anti-Semitic laws promulgated by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini which threatened Laura, who was Jewish.  Also, the new laws put most of Fermi's research assistants out of work.

Soon after his arrival in New York, Fermi began working at Columbia University.

Meitner’s and Frisch’s interpretation of the work of Hahn and Strassmann crossed the Atlantic Ocean with Niels Bohr, who was to lecture at Princeton University. Isidor Isaac Rabi and Willis Lamb, two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton, heard the news and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi said he told Enrico Fermi; Fermi gave credit to Lamb. Bohr soon thereafter went from Princeton to Columbia to see Fermi. Not finding Fermi in his office, Bohr went down to the cyclotron area and found Herbert L. Anderson. Bohr grabbed him by the shoulder and said: “Young man, let me explain to you about something new and exciting in physics.”<ref> Richard Rhodes ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb'' 268 (Simon and Schuster, 1986).</ref> It was clear to a number of scientists at Columbia that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium from neutron bombardment.

Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack. The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of The George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, which fostered many more experimental demonstrations.<ref> Richard Rhodes ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb'' 267-270 (Simon and Schuster, 1986).</ref>

Fermi then went to the University of Chicago and began studies that led to the construction of the first nuclear pile Chicago Pile-1.

Fermi recalled the beginning of the project in a speech given in 1954 when he retired as President of the American Physical Society:

left|thumb|200px|Fermi's ID badge photo from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos.]]
:"I remember very vividly the first month, January, 1939, that I started working at the fission and at least the outline of its interpretation. Then, somewhat later that same month, there was a meeting in Washington where the possible importance of the newly discovered phenomenon of fission was first discussed in semi-jocular earnest as a possible source of nuclear power."

right|200px|thumb|An image from the Fermi-Szilárd "neutronic reactor" patent.
In August 1939 famous letter warning President atomic pile" of critical on football stadium at the squash court", squash being an offshoot of hard racquets<ref>http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/unisci.html</ref>. This experiment was a landmark in the quest for energy, and it was typical of Fermi's brilliance. Every step had been carefully planned, every calculation meticulously done by him. When the first self-sustained nuclear chain reaction was achieved, a coded phone call was made by one of the physicists, James Conant, chairman of the National Defense Research Committee. The conversation was in impromptu code:

:Compton: The Italian navigator has landed in the New World.
:Conant: How were the natives?
:Compton: Very friendly.

This successful initiation of a chain-reacting pile was important not only for its help in assessing the properties of fission &mdash; needed for understanding the internal workings of an atomic bomb &mdash; but also because it would serve as a pilot plant for the massive reactors which would be created in Hanford, Washington, which would then be used to produce the Nagasaki. Eventually Fermi and Szilárd's reactor work was folded into the Manhattan Project.

Fermi moved to Los Alamos in the later stages of the Manhattan Project to serve as a general consultant. He was sitting in the control room of the Hanford B Reactor when it first went critical in 1944. His broad knowledge of many fields of physics was useful in solving problems that were of an interdisciplinary nature.

He became a naturalized citizen of the United States of America in 1944.

Fermi was present as an observer of the Trinity test on July 16, 1945. Engineer Jack Aeby saw Fermi at work:

{{cquote| As the shock wave hit Base Camp, Aeby saw Enrico Fermi with a handful of torn paper. "He was dribbling it in the air. When the shock wave came it moved the confetti. He thought for a moment."

Fermi had just estimated the yield of the first nuclear explosion. It was in the ball park.<ref>[http://larrycalloway.com/historic.html?_recordnum=105 The Trinity Test: Eyewitnesses]</ref>
}}

Fermi's strips-of-paper estimate was ten kilotons of TNT; the actual yield was about 19 kilotons<ref>[http://www.lanl.gov/history/atomicbomb/pdf/Enrico%20Fermis%20Observations%20at%20Trinity,%20July%2016,%201945.pdf Enrico Fermi's Observations at Trinity] </ref><ref> Nuclear weapon yield#Milestone nuclear explosions</ref>

==Post-War work==
In Fermi's 1954 address to the APS he also said, "Well, this brings us to Pearl Harbor. That is the time when I left Columbia University, and after a few months of commuting between Chicago and New York, eventually moved to Chicago to keep up the work there, and from then on, with a few notable exceptions, the work at Columbia was concentrated on the isotope separation phase of the atomic energy project, initiated by Booth, Dunning and Urey about 1940".

Fermi was widely regarded as the only physicist of the twentieth century who excelled both theoretically and experimentally (Snow, 1981) (see [http://www-news.uchicago.edu/fermi/resources.html link] below in 'References'). The well-known historian of physics, Rutherford's atomic nucleus, and then developing Bohr's theory of the hydrogen atom. If this sounds like hyperbole, anything about Fermi is likely to sound like hyperbole". Fermi's ability and success stemmed as much from his appraisal of the art of the possible, as from his innate skill and intelligence. He disliked complicated theories, and while he had great mathematical ability, he would never use it when the job could be done much more simply. He was famous for getting quick and accurate answers to problems which would stump other people. An instance of this was seen during the first atomic bomb test in TNT, the measured result was 18.6. (Rhodes, page 674). Later on, this method of getting approximate and quick answers through back-of-the-envelope calculations became informally known as the 'Fermi method'.

Fermi's most disarming trait was his great modesty, and his ability to do any kind of work, whether creative or routine. It was this quality that made him popular and liked among people of all strata, from other Nobel Laureates to technicians. Henry DeWolf Smyth, who was Chairman of the Princeton Physics department, had once invited Fermi over to do some experiments with the Princeton cyclotron. Walking into the lab one day, Smyth saw the distinguished scientist helping a graduate student move a table, under another student's directions. Another time, a Du Pont executive made a visit to see him at Columbia. Not finding him either in his lab or his office, the executive was surprised to find the Nobel Laureate in the machine shop, cutting sheets of tin with a big pair of shears.

After the war, Fermi served for a short time on the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, a Edward Teller's model of a fusion reaction could not be assured to propagate even with this large quantity of tritium.

In his later years, Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons. He was also known to be an inspiring teacher at the University of Chicago, and was known for his attention to detail, simplicity, and careful preparation for a lecture. Later, his lecture notes, especially those for quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, and thermodynamics, were transcribed into books which are still in print.

Also in these later years he mused about a proposition which is now referred to as the "Fermi Paradox". This absurd contradiction or proposition is this: that with the billions and billions of star systems in the universe, one would think that intelligent life would have contacted our civilization by now; yet this has not happened since it takes only about 600 years for a civilization to reach potential for annihilating itself with weapons of mass destruction as it grows in knowledge exponentially.

Fermi died at age 53 of stomach cancer and was interred at Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago, Illinois. Two of his graduate students who assisted him in working on or near the nuclear pile also died of cancer. Fermi and his team knew that such work carried considerable risk but they considered the outcome so vital that they forged ahead with little regard for their own personal safety.<ref>

As Eugene Wigner wrote: "Ten days before Fermi had died he told me, 'I hope it won't take long.' He had reconciled himself perfectly to his fate".

A recent poll by ''Time'' magazine listed Fermi among the top twenty scientists of the century.

The Fermilab particle accelerator and physics lab in Batavia, Illinois, is named after him in loving memory from the physics community.
