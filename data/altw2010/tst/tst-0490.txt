'''Igor González de Galdeano Aranzabal''' (born Basque Country) is a Spanish former professional road bicycle racer and current technical secretary at UCI ProTeam Euskaltel-Euskadi. Following a promising start to his career at Vitalicio Seguros, where he finished the 1999 Vuelta a España in second place, González de Galdeano became a key rival of Lance Armstrong in the middle of his Tour de France supremacy. In the 2002 Tour de France, González de Galdeano wore the yellow jersey for seven days and in the 2003 Vuelta a España wore the gold jersey for one day. At an average speed of 55.17&nbsp;km/h, González de Galdeano also holds the record for the fastest stage win in the Vuelta a España, a feat which earned him the nickname ''Speedy González''.<ref name="cnn"></ref>

==Early racing career==
González de Galdeano turned professional in 1995 with the Basque team Euskadi<ref name="trap-friis"/> (which is now Euskaltel-Euskadi), which at the time was only in its second year of racing and suffering from financial hardship.<ref></ref> During his three seasons at Euskadi, González de Galdeano achieved two stage victories and a number of sprints and mountains classifications.<ref name="trap-friis"></ref> For the 1999 season, González de Galdeano moved on to the Spanish Vitalicio Seguros team, and it was in this season that González de Galdeano made a name for himself on the domestic racing scene. Early in the season, González de Galdeano won stage five<ref></ref> and finishing fifth in the general classification of the Tirreno-Adriatico<ref></ref> and adding three more top ten placings in regional Spanish stage races through the season.<ref name="trap-friis"/>

Yet, González de Galdeano saved his best for the Vuelta a España in September. González de Galdeano won two stages - a 6&nbsp;km prologue around time-trialling skills, González de Galdeano eventually missed out on claiming the overall victory of the race when he lost nearly four minutes to the eventual race winner Frank Vandenbroucke was able to breakaway from the peloton and claim the points in intermediate sprints.<ref name="1999 vuelta" /> Nevertheless, González de Galdeano had an excellent Vuelta and raised his profile immeasurably.

== O.N.C.E. and the Armstrong rivalry ==
Following a lacklustre 2000 season and the demise of the Vitalicio Seguros squad, González de Galdeano moved to one of the top Spanish teams in 2001.<ref></ref> O.N.C.E. had a fresh look in this 88th edition of the Tour: Festina.<ref></ref> It was in this Tour that González de Galdeano first demonstrated his excellent time-trialling skills to the world beyond Spain, placing second in both the short prologue around Vuelta, placing fourth in the first stage time-trial<ref></ref> and winning a road stage into Zaragoza, breaking clear in the final kilometre to win the fastest ever stage in the Vuelta a España at 55.176&nbsp;km/h<ref></ref> and hencing coining his nickname, ''Speedy González''.<ref name="cnn" />

In 2002, with an increasing reputation as a time-triallist who was competent in the mountains, González de Galdeano formed a small rivalry with Lance Armstrong, the 1993 World Cycling Champion and already three-time winner of the Tour.<ref name="challenger"></ref> In the US Postal Service squad by 16 seconds to be clear of the American by 7 seconds.<ref></ref> González de Galdeano was able to retain the yellow jersey of race leader for seven stages.<ref></ref> Although Armstrong did overhaul González de Galdeano and Beloki to claim his fourth Tour, O.N.C.E. improved their performance over the previous year: Beloki moved up a step on the podium to second and was clearly Armstong's principal threat, González de Galdeano once again finished fifth, and with strong riding from team mate world time trial championships in Zolder.<ref></ref>

A combination of injury and French bureaucracy prevented González de Galdeano from taking part in the UCI did not count this as a positive test so no sanction was applied. However, the French authorities took a more stringent line and prevented him for racing on French soil for six months, over the period of the Tour. Also, González de Galdeano had a good showing at the Deutschland Tour, finishing second on the fifth stage. However, on the penultimate stage, he crashed and broke his collarbone.<ref></ref> As such, the planned appeal against the French ban became academic and González de Galdeano had to wait for the Vuelta. The 2003 Vuelta proved to be González de Galdeano's last Grand Tour as a leading protagonist. González de Galdeano went into the Vuelta as O.N.C.E. team leader, however, young team mate Isidro Nozal rode well throughout, until the penultimate stage, a time trial in which he lost over two minutes to Roberto Heras, the eventual race winner.<ref></ref> González de Galdeano finished fourth overall.<ref></ref>
