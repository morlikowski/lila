La '''bataille de la Passe de Kimbalongos''' (ou Kiava Longos) ou '''bataille du Kleidion''' (de nos jours dans la province de Blagoevgrad en Bulgarie) a eu lieu le 29 juillet 1014 entre la Bulgarie et l’Empire byzantin. 

== Prélude ==

Les Byzantins et les Bulgares étaient en guerre depuis des décennies. Mais la guerre entra dans une phase décisive en Samuel I de Bulgarie entreprit d'agrandir son territoire en envahissant la Grèce byzantine. Samuel captura des terres jusqu’au sud d’Athènes.

Basile II, désireux d'arrêter cette expansion et de reconquérir les terres perdues sur les Bulgares depuis les siècles précédents, décida d'éliminer définitivement le danger bulgare. Il lance chaque année des raids contre leurs territoires. Dès 1005 il avait dégagé Thessalonique, récupéré la Grèce, et formé une alliance avec la Serbie.

== La bataille ==

La guerre atteignit son point culminant en 1014, quand Basile se trouva finalement face à l’armée bulgare tout entière, ce qu’il n’avait pu faire lors des 12 années précédentes. Samuel avait construit des fossés le long de la frontière et avait protégé plusieurs des vallées et des passages par des murs et des tours, particulièrement le passage de Kleidion sur le fleuve Struma, par lequel Basile II aurait très probablement dû passer pour atteindre le cœur de la Bulgarie. Tout en menant ses troupes vers Kleidion, Basile était fréquemment attaqué par des brigands bulgares, mais ceux-ci furent défaits par un détachement des troupes byzantines sous le commandement de Théophylacte Botaneiatès, le stratège de Thessalonique.

Au Kleidion, Basile assiégea les fortifications, sans pouvoir passer par la vallée, qui était défendue par environ 15 à  Bulgares. Le général byzantin Nicéphore Xiphias contourna alors les montagnes, prenant les Bulgares à revers. Les Bulgares abandonnèrent leurs tours pour faire face à cette nouvelle menace, et Basile put traverser la vallée en toute tranquilité. Dans la confusion qui s'ensuivit, des milliers de Bulgares furent tués ; selon le récit de l’historien byzantin Jean Skylitzès, Samuel était présent à la bataille et ne put s’échapper de justesse qu’avec l’aide du cheval de son fils.

The '''Battle of Kleidion''' (; , also '''Clidium''' and '''Bulgarian Emperor Samuil and the Byzantine Emperor Basil II in the late 10th and early 11th centuries. The result was a decisive Byzantine victory.

The battle took place in the valley between the mountains of Belasitsa and Ograzhden near the modern Bulgarian village of Klyuch. The decisive encounter occurred on 29 July with an attack in the rear by a force under the Byzantine general Nicephorus Xiphias, who had infiltrated the Bulgarian positions. The ensuing battle was a major defeat for the Bulgarians. Bulgarian soldiers were captured and blinded by order of Basil II, who was subsequently known as "Bulgar-slayer". Samuil survived the battle, but died two months later from a heart attack, reportedly brought on by the sight of his blind soldiers.

Although the engagement did not end the First Bulgarian Empire, the Battle of Kleidion reduced its ability to resist Byzantine advances and can be considered the pivotal encounter of the war with Byzantium. The heirs of Samuil could not subsequently hold off the Byzantine advance, and in 1018 the Bulgarian Empire was finally destroyed by Basil II.

==Prelude==

The origins of the conflict date back to the 7th century, when the Bulgarians under Khan Asparukh established a state along the Danube in one of the provinces of the Eastern Roman Empire. As a result, the Bulgarian state was forced to fight a series of wars with Byzantium in order to secure its continued existence.<ref>''Mutafchiev'', Book about the Bulgarians, p. 59</ref>

Over the next fifteen years, while Basil was preoccupied with revolts against his rule and the Fatimid threat in the East, Samuil retook most of the previously conquered Bulgarian lands and carried the war into enemy territory in a series of campaigns. However, his invasion of southern Macedonia. Over these and the next few years, a regular pattern emerged: the Byzantines would campaign in Bulgaria, laying siege to forts and pillaging the countryside, while the numerically inferior Bulgarians, unable to offer direct opposition, launched diversionary raids in Macedonia and Greece. Despite some successes, these did not achieve any permanent results, nor did they force Basil to abandon his campaigns in Bulgaria. A counter-attack in 1009 failed at the Battle of Kreta,<ref>''Gyuzelev'', Short History of Bulgaria, p. 71; ''Nikolov'', Centralism and Regionalism in Early Medieval Bulgaria (end of 7 to beginning of 11 century), p. 130</ref> and although the Byzantines themselves did not achieve any decisive success, their methodical war of attrition deprived the Bulgarians of their strongholds and gradually weakened their forces.<ref>''Pirivatrich'', The State of Samuil, pp. 135&ndash;136</ref> In the words of Byzantine historian John Skylitzes: "The Emperor Basil II continued to invade Bulgaria each year and destroy and devastate everything on his way. Samuil could not stop him in the open field or to engage the Emperor in a decisive battle, and suffered many defeats and began to lose his strength."<ref>''Ioannes Scylitzes'', Historia, in "Selected sources" Vol. II, pp. 65&ndash;66</ref> The culmination of the war came in 1014, when Samuil, at the head of his army, resolved to stop the Byzantine army before it could enter the Bulgarian heartland.

==Preparations for the battle==
Samuil knew that the Byzantine army would have to invade the country through a series of mountain passes, and so took precautions to bar them. The Bulgarians built ditches along the frontier and fortified many of the valleys and passes with walls and towers, especially the pass of Kleidion on the Struma River which Basil would need to pass through to reach the heart of Bulgaria. Samuil heavily fortified the northern slopes of the Belasitsa mountain to the south and east of Strumitsa Castle.<ref>''Ioannes Scylitzes'', Historia, II, p. 45</ref> The wide valley of the Strumitsa River was a convenient place for attack and it had been used by Byzantine forces for this purpose in previous years. The Bulgarians disposed a strong guard to keep the pass safe.<ref>''N. Gregoras'', ed. Bon., I, p. 379</ref><ref>''Cantacuzenus'', III, p.156</ref> In addition, the Bulgarian ruler chose Strumitsa for his defensive base&nbsp;— it was located on the road from Thessaloniki leading to Thrace to the east and Ohrid to the west.<ref>''Zlatarski'', History of Bulgaria in the Middle Ages , Vol. I, Part 2, pp. 731&ndash;732, 736</ref> The rugged terrain to the south was dotted with earthworks and walls guarded by strong Bulgarian units.<ref>''Nikolov'', Centralism and Regionalism in Early Medieval Bulgaria , pp. 179&ndash;180</ref><ref>A description of the palisade built by Samuil between Belasitsa and Ograzhden (in Bulgarian) - [http://logos.uni-plovdiv.bg/GetResource?id=161 G. Mitrev, ''The palisade of Samuil and the battle in 1014''], pp. 76&ndash;79, in: Macedonian Review (journal), in Bulgarian, 1993, issue 2</ref>

Samuil's decision to face Basil II and the bulk of his army at Kleidion was not only prompted by the constant defeats and invasions which had devastated the country, but also by concerns over his authority among the nobility, which had been fatally weakened by Basil's campaigns. In 1005 for example, the governor of the important Dyrrhachium had surrendered the town to Basil II.<ref>''Ostrogorski'', History of Byzantium , pp. 404&ndash;405</ref> To face this threat, Samuil gathered a large army to face the Byzantines, some claiming it numbered as many as 45,000 soldiers.<ref>''Nikolov'', Centralism and Regionalism in Early Medieval Bulgaria , p. 131. ''G. Nikolov'' estimates the total number of the Bulgarian army including the squads of local militia at maximum 45,000. The Byzantine historian Georgius Monachus Continuatus wrote that the Bulgarian army had 360,000 men, a greatly exaggerated number, the actual being 10 times smaller</ref> Basil II also prepared carefully, assembling a large army of his own and taking his most experienced commanders, including the governor of Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv), Nicephorus Xiphias, who had conquered the old Bulgarian capitals Pliska and Preslav from Samuil in 1001.

==The battle==
The Byzantine army marched from Constantinople through Komotini, Drama and Serres and reached the Rupel gorge on the Struma river. From there the army entered the Strumitsa valley and reached the vicinity of the village of Klyuch, where the river bent and approached Belasitsa and Ozgrazhden. There the army was stopped by a thick wooden wall, defended by Bulgarian soldiers.<ref>''Zlatarski'', History of Bulgaria in the Middle Ages, Vol. I, Part 2, p. 731</ref><ref>''Nikolov'', Centralism and Regionalism in Early Medieval Bulgaria, p. 180</ref> The Byzantines attacked the palisade immediately, but were repulsed with heavy casualties.<ref>''Ioannes Scylitzes'', Historia, II, p. 457</ref><ref>''Zonaras'', ibid., IV, p. 121</ref>

In response, Samuil sent a large army under one of the most able Bulgarian nobles, Thessalonika, but Byzantine troops under Theophylactus Botaniates, the ''defeat them outside the city walls in a bloody battle. Theophylactus captured many soldiers and a large quantity of military equipment and marched north to join Basil II at Klyuch.<ref>''Ioannes Scylitzes'', Historia, "Selected sources", Vol. II, p. 66</ref><ref>''Zlatarski'', History of Bulgaria in the Middle Ages, Vol. I, Part 2, pp. 732&ndash;734</ref>
