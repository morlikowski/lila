La '''classe Orizzonte/Horizon.

L''''Horizon Common New Generation Frigate (CNGF)''' è la sigla che identifica una nuova generazione di fregate ('''DDG''', cacciatorpediniere secondo la classificazione NATO) AAW (Anti-Air Warfare, Ruolo Anti Aereo) frutto di una collaborazione internazionale fra Regno Unito, Francia ed Italia. 

Avendo gli inglesi abbandonato il progetto per investire sul programma nazionale del nuovo cacciatorpediniere ''Type 45'', le navi sono attualmente in costruzione come programma congiunto tra Andrea Doria e il Caio Duilio, costruite rispettivamente presso i cantieri navali di Riva Trigoso e di Muggiano ed attualmente in allestimento, che rimpiazzeranno i cacciatorpediniere classe Audace andati in disarmo nel 2006. 

Le prime due unità navali, ''Forbin'' e ''Andrea Doria'' sono, altresì, denominate FOC1 e FOC2, le restanti navi sono denominate FOS.

La differenza tra le unità italiane e le francesi è nella dotazione missilistica. Le navi italiane della ''Classe Andrea Doria'' saranno dotate di missili antinave superficie/superficie del tipo Teseo Mk2/A, quelle francesi di missili Exocet. 

L'entrata in servizio nella Marina Militare è prevista all'inizio del 2008 per l'''Andrea Doria'', varata il 15 ottobre 2005, e nel 2010 per la ''Caio Duilio''.

The '''Horizon Common New Generation Frigate (CNGF)''' is a multi-national collaboration to produce a new generation of anti-air warfare Britain, France and Italy, the project is now a French/Italian effort following the withdrawal of Britain due to differing requirements. It is named '''Orizzonte''' in Italian and '''Horizon''' in French.

==History==
UK issued a joint requirement in 1992 after the failure of the NATO Frigate Replacement (NFR-90) project. The resulting CNGF program consisted of the ''Horizon'' frigate and its Principal Anti Air Missile System (PAAMS).

Problems emerged almost immediately:  the primary problem was that of differing requirements: France wanted  Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) escorts for its aircraft carriers, but only a limited range was necessary due to the self-defence capability of the ''Charles De Gaulle''. Italy too required only close range capabilities, as in its home waters of the Cavour. The Royal Navy, however, required more capable ships which could throw a large defensive "bubble" over a fleet operating in hostile areas. The compromise which largely solved this problem was the adoption of a standard radar interface which allowed France and Italy to install the EMPAR multi-function radar and the UK to install the more capable SAMPSON radar - the SAMPSON radar has a higher data rate and adaptive beam forming allows a greater multi-tracking capability, long-range detection of low-RCS targets, a lower false-alarm rate, and overall higher tracking accuracy.<ref></ref>

1995 saw the establishment of an International Joint Venture Company (IJVC) compromising the national prime contractors, DCN (France,) GEC-Marconi (UK) and Orizzonte (Italy). In the period 1995-1996 significant arguments, changing requirements and technological problems led to the slippage of the in-service-date of the frigates to around 2006.

In early 1997 a disagreement emerged as to the choice of Vertical Launch System (VLS) for the PAAMS' Tomahawk Land Attack Missile. This issue was eventually resolved when the SYLVER launcher was selected by the PAAMS development team.

The second batch of 4 ship, 2 for France and 2 Italy, will not be built for budget problems.

===UK withdrawal===
On 26 April 1999 the UK announced that it was withdrawing from the CNGF project to pursue its own national design. The ''Financial Times'' summarised the main disagreements between the partner countries; the UK wanted a large frigate which could patrol large areas such as the Atlantic, compared to France's desire for smaller aircraft carrier escorts and Italy's intention to use them in the Mediterranean; Secondly the UK wanted the ships with a wide-area defence capability, able to protect large numbers of ships rather than just protection from missiles targeted in the frigate's general direction; Finally the UK's desire to see Marconi appointed as prime contractor was accepted by France, but only in return for DCN being given the role as prime contractor for the combat management system. The UK, which wished to see a BAE-led consortium given this role, would not accept this.<ref></ref>

Summing up the changes from the original specification the UK's Chief of Defence Procurement is reported to have said "it's not common and it's not a frigate!". The resulting Type 45 destroyer is armed with the PAAMS missile system and has benefited from investment in the ''Horizon'' project.

===Franco-Italian project===
France and Italy have continued their collaboration under the ''Horizon'' project, ordering two ships each which will also deploy the PAAMS missile system. The first ship of the series, the French ''Forbin'', was launched on the 10th March 2005.
