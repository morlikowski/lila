==History==

The first settlers of Hopkins arrived in 1852<ref>[http://www.hopkinsmn.com/community/history.html City of Hopkins website], City History webpage</ref> as land around the growing Minneapolis-St. Paul area was opening up and being explored by members stationed at Fort Snelling.  However, the roots of the town begin in 1887 with the building of the Minneapolis Threshing Machine Company, later called Minneapolis-Moline, to make farm equipment . At the time, Minneapolis Moline employed most of the Hopkins residents.  In 1887, the West Minneapolis Land Company was founded and formed to build housing for the Minneapolis Moline factory workers.  

Until 1893, Hopkins was part of Hennepin County Board of Commissioners a petition signed by 41 residents, asking that a separate village be formed. Following an election, the community was then incorporated as the village of ''West Minneapolis'' with a population of 1,105.  The original village consisted of about three square miles, and it has been enlarged by annexation to its present size of about four square miles.

In 1928, the name of the village was changed to Hopkins after Harley H. Hopkins, who was among its first homesteaders and was the community's first postmaster.  Mr. Hopkins allowed the town to build the train depot on his land (now [http://www.thedepotcoffeehouse.com/ The Depot Coffee House]) with the agreement that the train station would say "Hopkins" on it. People getting off the train assumed the name of the town was Hopkins and it stuck.  On January 1, 1948, the village became a city upon adoption of what is called the council-city manager charter.
