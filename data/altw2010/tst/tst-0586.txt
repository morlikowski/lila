'''合金弹头2：超级战车001/II'''（'''Metal Slug 2: Super Vehicle 001/II'''）是SNK于1998年推出的合金弹头系列的第二代。由本作确立的很多新要素也被后续作品一直沿用，在系列的发展史上，合金弹头2有着十分重要的地位。

==故事情节==
在前次大战发生的2年之后，失踪的莫丁将军带着新的部队卷土重来。在前次大战中拯救世界的“游隼”部队成员马可·罗斯少校（前作为中尉）和塔尔玛·洛文上尉（前作为少尉）为此再度出击。而这次，他们拥有了两名新伙伴：来自“游隼”的支援部队“麻雀”的女性士官笠本英里中士和菲欧·杰尔米上士。而在战斗过程中，暗藏在莫丁背后的一个更大的敌人也渐渐浮出水面……

==新要素==
===新角色与角色选择===
游戏新增了两位新角色，玩家可以在游戏开始前自由选择使用的人物而不是像前作般1P和2P分别固定使用马可和塔尔玛。

除两位女性角色的跳跃能力比男主角略高，滞空时间稍久外，四名主人公在实际游戏过程中并没有多少能力差异。
===变异===
在第二关角色被木乃伊喷出的毒烟攻击时自己也会变成木乃伊，此时人物行动会变得迟缓并只能使用手枪和手榴弹，并且投掷手榴弹的时间也会变长。在木乃伊状态下得到强化武器都会变成加1000分的宝物。特殊道具“圣水”可以解除此状态。

在第四关会出现很多食物（加分宝物），大量获得后角色会变成胖子。此时人物的行动会变慢但攻击将得到强化，而武器也会变得非常搞笑。如近身攻击由匕首变为叉子和皮鞭；手榴弹外形变成喜剧化的黑色球形炸弹；同时主武器的子弹也会变大。特殊道具“减肥药”可解除此状态。

===新武器===
*L-Laser：激光枪，新增的枪械，发射伤害力较大的光束，加分非常快，是捞分的好武器。初始弹药200发。
*燃烧瓶：新增的副武器，掷出后落地即爆炸，产生大面积的火焰攻击。
*穿甲弹：载具的副武器，弹道呈直线，对敌方装甲单位产生更大的伤害。
===新载具===
*Camel Slug：装备12.6mm火神炮的骆驼，无装甲，副武器为角色的手榴弹，只在第一关出现。
*SlugNoid：跳跃力强但左右行动迟缓的步行机甲，两臂分别为两挺12.6mm火神炮，另外装有向下发射的127mm加农炮，若遭受攻击会先后失去两臂的机炮，第二关出现。
*Fly Slug：装备12.6mm火神炮和导弹的小型垂直起落战斗机，火神炮的射程范围只限前方45度范围，机翼上还可以让另一位玩家站立，第三关出现。

===新敌人===
*阿拉伯兵：第一关出现，投掷弯刀攻击主角。
*阿拉伯大刀兵：第一、二关出现，冲向主角用大砍刀攻击，出刀速度极快。
*木乃伊：第二关出现，有普通的喷紫色毒烟木乃伊和吐出毒物滚雷的白色木乃伊，使用散弹枪S或火焰枪F能够对其造成强力伤害。
*生化自爆人：第五关出现，用手脚在墙壁和地面爬行的生化人，出现后体色渐渐变红并自爆。
*火星人：第六关出现，章鱼般的外形相信是来自于世界大战》的发想，灰色的为一般型，发射黄色的泡泡状子弹；黑色的为精锐部队，有的会发射出速度更快的蓝色子弹。后来在SVC Chaos: SNK VS. CAPCOM和NEO GEO Battlecoliseum中此角色作为隐藏人物出场。

 is a Neo-Geo console/arcade platform created by SNK. It was released in 1998 for the MVS arcade platform and is the sequel to the popular ''''Metal Slug'' series. The game was later re-released in a slightly modified/remixed form as ''Metal Slug X''.

==Story==
General Morden, the antagonist from the first game is back once more with his army, bent on taking over the world. It is up to the Peregrine Falcon squad, who are now joined by two new characters: Eri Kasamoto and Fiolina Germi of the Sparrows Intelligence Unit, to save the day. <!--As the levels unfold, it turns out that Morden made a pact with the Devil, when he made an alliance with Martians to help facilitate his plans.-- What did the Devil have to do with all this? ~~~~--> As the levels unfold, it turns out that Morden has allied with Martians to help facilitate his plans. Eventually the tables are turned when Morden comes under attack and is betrayed by his Martian allies. An ad-hoc alliance is formed between the Peregrine Falcon squad and General Morden's army to combat the greater alien threat.

==New features==

===Vehicles and weapons===
''Metal Slug 2'' added new weapons to the player's arsenal. A single shot from the '''Laser''' is capable of killing a column of infantry, and sustained fire quickly destroyed vehicles. '''Fire Bombs''' found in the second level help to clear away mummies. '''Armor Piercing Shells''' give the Metal Slug cannon shot that only fire straight when engaging enemy vehicles.

The game also included more fighting vehicles. Though just as susceptible to enemy fire as the Metal Slug, these vehicles provided alternate modes of transportation, and advantages associated with each.
* The '''Camel Slug''' is simply a Vulcan cannon mounted onto a camel. The rider is elevated and still vulnerable to enemy fire, but has improved movement. (Using the Suicide Attack does not cause the Camel Slug to explode, unlike its sister vehicles.)
* To help fight a boss that crawls up a tower, the '''Slugnoid''' armored frame is capable of leaping to great heights. Its cannon is pointed downward, to assail the enemy below. Twin Vulcan cannons provide plenty of fire, but are stripped with each hit the Slugnoid takes.
* The '''Slug Flyer''' is a VTOL jet fighter. It fires powerful air-to-air missiles at its targets, and its Vulcan Cannon is designed to fire upon forward targets. Another player can "wing-walk", or ride on top of the plane.

===Character transformation===
''Metal Slug 2'' introduced the ability into the franchise for characters to transform into different variants during the course of the game. The first transformation is one into a mummy during the second mission of the game. Any hit from the purple tinged attacks of the mummy-variants or potions dropped by bats will trigger the transformation. This causes a drastic reduction in player movement speed and loss of any special weapon. Mummified characters hold only a pistol), which they fire at a rate of half as fast as normal, and they take time to toss a grenade. Players can not use the knife when transformed. Another hit by purple mist will cause the player, transformed as the mummy, to burn in a purple flame and die. There are antidotes hidden throughout the level and dropped by enemies that can restore the player to human form.

Also introduced in this game was the ability to become obese. This transformation is gained, logically, by the acquirement of many food items during a single game-life. Once enough food is obtained the announcer yells "Uh-oh, big!," and the character is radically transformed. Movement speed is slowed, but every weapon's attack is altered: melee attacks are changed from a knife to a fork (belt whip if sitting), grenades are changed to larger comedy-style bombs, and the current weapon is replaced with a version that has larger bullets and may have its properties altered. If a diet-powder canister is found, enough time passes without picking up any food items, or the player is killed, the player(s) will revert to their former average-girth selves.
