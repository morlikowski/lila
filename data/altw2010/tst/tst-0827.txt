On Council for National Security (CNS) overthrew his government in a bloodless coup while he was attending a UN meeting in assassinated if he returned to Thailand.

Thaksin is married to Panthongtae and two daughters, Pintongtha and Peathongtarn.

==Family background==
Thaksin's great-grandfather 丘）)was a Hakka Chinese immigrant from Meizhou, Guangdong who arrived in Siam in the 1860s and settled in Chiang Mai in 1908. His eldest son, Chiang Sae Khu, was born in Chanthaburi in 1890 and married a Thai woman, called Saeng Somna. Chiang's eldest son, Sak, adopted the Thai surname Shinawatra ("does good routinely") in 1938 because of the country's anti-Chinese movement and the rest of the family also adopted it.  

Thaksin's father, Lert, was born in Chiang Mai in 1919 and married Yindi Ramingwong. In 1968, Lert Shinawatra entered politics and became an MP for Chiang Mai and deputy leader of the now-defunct Liberal party. Lert Shinawatra quit politics in 1976.

Thaksin's great-grandfather Seng Sae Khu made his fortune through Chiang Mai's San Kamphaeng district, and opened two movie theatres, a gas station, and a car and motorcycle dealership. By the time Thaksin was born, the Shinawatra family was one of the richest and most influential families in Chiang Mai.

==Early life==
Thaksin was born in San Kamphaeng, Chiang Mai. Thaksin grew up in the village of Sankamphaeng until he was 15, after which he moved to Chiang Mai city to study at Montfort College. At 16, he helped run one of his father's cinemas.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3700199.stm BBC News, Billionaire hopes to score Liverpool deal, 18 May 2004]</ref>

==Police career==
Thaksin attended the 10th class of the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School.<ref>Bangkok Post, Thaksin's classmates close ranks behind him on his 58th birthday, 27 July 1999</ref>  He then attended the Potjaman Damapong, the daughter of a police general, in 1980.<ref>[http://www.cityu.edu.hk/searc/WP36_02_PasukBaker.pdf Pasuk Phongpaichit & Chris Baker, "The Only Good Populist is a Rich Populist: Thaksin Shinawatra and Thailand's Democracy, October 2002]</ref>

==Business career==
===Early successes and failures===
Thaksin and his wife ventured into several businesses while Thaksin was still in the police force. These included opening a silk shop, opening a movie theatre, and developing an apartment building. All of these ventures were failures, and left him over 50 million Baht in debt. He established ICSI in 1982 which leased computers to government agencies and was a modest success. However, later ventures in security systems (SOS) and public bus radio services (Bus Sound) were failures.<ref name="TranscriptInterview">[http://tri333.exteen.com/ Transcript of an interview between Thaksin Shinawatra and Cheeptham Khamwisit (Thai: ชีพธรรม คำวิเศษณ์) on the Thaiventure.com program on FM 102 radio station]</ref><ref>[http://www.thaksin.net/life.html Personal background from personal website]</ref>  In April 1986, he founded Advanced Info Service (AIS), which started off as a computer rental business.<ref>[http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:CBYv64_bKegJ:www.jobtopgun.com/profile/searchprofile%3Fid_emp%3D255+%22Advanced+Info+Service%22+%22telephone+services+using+900+MHz%22&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=1&client=firefox-a Google Cache of a JobTopGun profile of AIS's corporate milestones]</ref>

The Shinawatra Computer and Communications Group was founded in 1987 and listed in The Stock Exchange of Thailand in 1990.

In 1990, Thaksin founded Shinawatra Satellite, which has developed and operated a total of four Thaicom communications satellites.

In 1999, the Shinawatra family spent approximately 1 billion baht establishing Shinawatra University in Pathum Thani's Sam Khok district. The private university offered international programs in engineering, architecture, and business management. After the 2006 military coup, half of the junior students dropped out, fearing repercussions in the job market. As of 2007, the University had an endowment of 300 million baht.<ref>Bangkok Post, [http://pages.citebite.com/h1h9g8c2p0esa Shinawatra University, founded by ex-PM, falls on hard times], 23 July 2007</ref>

==Entry into politics==
===Political debut as Foreign Minister in the first Chuan government===
Thaksin entered politics in late 1994 through Chamlong Srimuang, who had just reclaimed the position of Palang Dharma Party (PDP) leader from Boonchu Rojanastien. In a subsequent purge of Boonchu-affiliated PDP Cabinet ministers, Thaksin was appointed Foreign Minister in December 1994, replacing Prasong Soonsiri.<ref>Asia Times, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HL22Ae01.html Grumbles, revelations of a Thai coup maker], 22 December 2006</ref>

The PDP soon withdrew from the government over the Sor Por Kor 4-01 land reform corruption scandal, causing the government of Chuan Leekpai to collapse.

===PDP leader and Deputy Prime Minister in the Banharn government===
Chamlong, strongly criticized for mishandling internal PDP politics in the last days of the Chuan-government, retired from politics and hand-picked Thaksin as new PDP leader. Thaksin ran for election for the first time for the constitutional tribunal and lost. 

Thaksin joined the government of Banharn Silpa-Archa and was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in charge of Bangkok traffic. In May 1996, Thaksin and 4 other PDP ministers quit the Banharn Cabinet (while retaining their MP seats), prompting a Cabinet reshuffle. Many have claimed that Thaksin's move was designed to help give Chamlong Srimuang a boost in the June 1996 Bangkok Governor elections, which Chamlong returned from retirement to contest.<ref>[http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/96/0524/nat12.html Thailand: Double Trouble For the PM: A parliamentary vote splits the government coalition] May 24, 1996</ref>  Chamlong lost the election - he and incumbent Governor former PDP-member Krisda Arunwongse na Ayudhya were defeated by Bhichit Rattakul, an independent.  

Chamlong's failure to buttress the PDP's failing power base in Bangkok amplified internal divisions in the PDP, particularly between Chamlong's "temple" faction and Thaksin's faction. Soon afterwards, Chamlong announced he was retiring again from politics.

Thaksin and the PDP pulled out of the Banharn-government in August 1996. In a subsequent no-confidence debate, the PDP gave evidence against the Banharn government. Soon afterwards, Banharn dissolved Parliament in September 1996.

===Fall of the PDP===

Thaksin announced that he would not run in the subsequent November 1996 elections, but would remain as leader of the PDP. Some speculated that Thaksin wanted to resign from the party leadership. The PDP suffered a fatal defeat in the elections, winning only 1 seat in Parliament. The PDP soon imploded, with most members resigning. 

Although there was much controversy about the root causes of the fall of the PDP, most agree that it was due to internal divisions in the party. Particularly divisive were conflicts between the Chamlong "temple" faction and subsequent generations of outsiders, including Thaksin.

===Deputy Prime Minister in the Chavalit government===
On 15 August 1997, Thaksin became Deputy Prime Minister in Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's government. This occurred soon after the Thai Baht was floated and devalued in 2 July 1997, sparking the Asian Financial Crisis. Thaksin held this position for only 3 months, leaving on November 14 after Chavalit resigned.

During a censure debate on 27 September 1997, Democrat Suthep Thaugsuban accused Thaksin of profiting on insider information about the government's decision to float the Baht.<ref>[http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/97/1010/nat2.html Pressure from below: Supporters of the new, improved Constitution now have to help turn words into action] October 10, 1997</ref>  However, the subsequent Democrat party led government did not investigate the accusations.

===Formation of the Thai Rak Thai Party and the 2001 elections===

Thaksin founded the Thai Rak Thai ("Thais Love Thais" - TRT) party in 1998 along with Somkid Jatusripitak, PDP ally Sudarat Keyuraphan, Purachai Piumsombun,<ref>[http://www.msutoday.msu.edu/news/index.php3?article=14Oct2004-8 MSU alumni, friends, honored for outstanding achievements: Purachai Piumsombun of Bangkok, Thailand] October 14, 2004</ref> and 19 others.  

With a populist platform often attributed to Somkid, TRT promised universal access to healthcare, a 3-year debt moratorium for farmers, and 1 million THB locally-managed development funds for all Thai villages.  

After Prime Minister Chuan dissolved parliament in November 2000, TRT won a sweeping victory in the January 2001 elections, the first election held under the Constitution of 1997. At the time, academics called the 2001 election the most open, corruption-free election in Thai history.<ref name="2001electionclean" />  Thai Rak Thai won 248 parliamentary seats (more than any other party previously) and needed only 3 more seats to form a government. Nonetheless, Thaksin opted for a broad coalition to gain total control and avoid a vote of no confidence, with the Chart Thai Party (41 seats) and the New Aspiration Party (36 seats), while absorbing the smaller Seritham Party (14 seats).<ref>Aurel Croissant and Jörn Dosch, Old Wine in New Bottlenecks?

==Prime Minister of Thailand==

As Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra initiated many distinctive policies affecting the economy, public health, education, energy, drugs and international relations. He gained two landslide re-election victories.<ref name=jam /> Thaksin's policies have been particularly effective at reducing rural poverty<ref name=autogenerated4 /> and at providing affordable health coverage to the people. Because of this, his main support base has been the rural poor.<ref name=jam />

His Cabinet was packed with academics, former student leaders, and former leaders of the Phalang Dharma party, including Prommin Lertsuridej, Chaturon Chaisang, Prapat Panyachatraksa, Surapong Suebwonglee, Somkid Jatusripitak, Surakiart Sathirathai, and Sudarat Keyuraphan. Traditional leaders of regional coalitions also became minor members of his Cabinet.

His government has been frequently challenged with allegations of dictatorship, a free press. A controversial leader, he has also been the target of numerous allegations of lèse-majesté, treason, usurping religious and royal authority, selling assets to international investors, religious desecration, and siding with the forces of darkness.<ref name=autogenerated3 /><ref name=autogenerated2 />

===Economic policies===
:''see also: Policies of the Thaksin government#Economic and health policies and Thaksinomics.''

Thaksin's government had designed its policies to appeal to the rural majority, initiating programs like village-managed microcredit development funds, low-interest agricultural loans, direct injections of cash into village development funds (the SML scheme), infrastructure development, and the One Tambon One Product (OTOP) rural small and medium enterprise development program.  

fiscal deficits in 2001 and 2002, Thaksin balanced the national budget, producing comfortable fiscal surpluses for 2003 to 2005. Despite a massive program of infrastructure investments, a balanced budget was projected for 2007.<ref>Asian Development Bank, [http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/ADO/2006/tha.asp Asian Development Outlook 2006: Thailand]</ref>  Public sector debt fell from 57% of GDP in January 2001 to 41% in September 2006.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30019150 Public debt end-Sept falls to 41.28% of GDP], 17 November 2006</ref><ref>World Bank, [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTHAILAND/Resources/Economic-Monitor/2003oct.pdf Thailand Economic Monitor, October 2003]</ref>  Foreign exchange reserves doubled from US$30 billion in 2001 to US$64 billion in 2006.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/12/25/headlines/headlines_30022396.php Black Tuesday: Did the BOT overreact?], 25 December 2006</ref>

Critics claim that Keynesian-style economic stimulus policy re-branded as something new and revolutionary. Economists from the Thailand Development Research Institute argue that other factors, such as a revival in export demand, were the primary cause behind the economy's recovery.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/30/business/business_30000503.php TDRI ECONOMISTS: Thaksinomics 'not a driver of growth'] - Wichit Chaitrong, ''The Nation'', March 30, 2006</ref> Others claimed that the policies got the rural poor "hooked on Thaksin's hand-outs."<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/05/opinion/opinion_30015415.php Forget the apologies, let the PM rebuild democracy], 5 October 2006</ref>

Thaksin helped bring part of Thailand's massive underground lottery system into the legal fold by operating a successful numbers game (Thai: หวย) run by the Government Lottery Office. Lottery sales of approx. 70 billion THB (2 billion USD) are used for social projects, including the "One District, One Scholarship" program which provided one student from a low-income family in each district with a scholarship to study overseas. Soon after Thaksin was deposed, the junta banned the lottery, claiming it was a social vice, luring the poor to become addicted to gambling, instead of working. In addition, the Supreme Court ruled that the Cabinet did not have the right to introduce the lottery without due political process. The scholarship program was also stopped.<ref>The Nation, "Ministry suspends lottery sales", 18 November 2006</ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref>[http://www.responsiblegambling.org/articles/Intoxicated_thailand_losing_billions_to_lottery_study.pdf "Intoxicated" Thailand losing billions to lottery: study] September 5, 2004</ref><ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015451 Justice permanent secretary to seek abolition of jackpot price of Govt lottery], 5 October 2006</ref>  The military junta also claimed that Thaksin's government "mischievously spent the proceeds in any way it saw fit".<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/05/03/national/national_30033268.php Lotteries move lacks understanding], 3 May 2007</ref>

The Thaksin government reduced the state's control of the media by privatizing MCOT, a large television and radio broadcaster.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/24/national/national_30019832.php Activists call for MCOT delisting], 24 November 2006</ref>

After the 2006 coup, many of Thaksin's economic policies were stopped, the OTOP program was rebranded, the Government Lottery Office's program was deemed illegal, and the government nationalized several media outlets and energy companies.

===Healthcare policies===
Thaksin initiated two key healthcare policies: subsidized universal health care and low-cost universal access to anti-retroviral HIV medication (ARVs). Thaksin's 30-baht/visit universal healthcare program won the applause of the general public, but was criticized by many doctors and officials.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  Prior to the program's introduction, a large portion of the population had no health insurance and limited access to healthcare. The program helped increase access to healthcare from 76% of the population to 96% of the population.<ref></ref>  The program also increased workloads for healthcare employees, and caused many doctors to switch to higher paying careers. It has been criticized for being underfunded. The program led some hospitals to seek alternative sources of income, leading to a boom in the medical tourism industry, with 1.3 million foreign patients earning Thailand 33 billion THB (approx. 800 million USD) in 2005.<ref>[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=201904 85 Bogus Doctors Arrested In Thailand Last Year] June 6, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.thaiwebsites.com/medical-tourism-thailand.asp First International Trade Exhibition and Conference on Medical Tourism, Spa and Wellness Industries, in Bangkok, March 20-23 2008] 2007</ref>

Post-coup Public Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla called the 30-baht program a "marketing gimmick" and claimed that the government would "very soon" stop charging patients any fees for visits to state hospitals.<ref>The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/13/national/national_30016065.php Bt30 health fee may be scrapped], 14 October 2006</ref>

During the Thaksin government, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS as well as the overall prevalence rate noticeably declined.<ref>[http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2006/2006_country_progress_report_thailand_en.pdf Follow-up to the declaration of commitment on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS)] December 2004</ref>  Although successful in expanding access to HIV medication, there have been concerns that a free trade agreement with the US could endanger Thailand's ability to produce generic HIV treatments.<ref></ref>

Thaksin allowed the estimated 2.3 million migrant workers in Thailand to register and seek health coverage under the Thai national healthcare system. They were also eligible for work permits at the end of the registration period, entitling them to full labor protection.  Democrat Party Labour Group Committee Pongsak Plengsaeng criticized the move, claiming that it would lead to unemployment amongst Thais. Pongsak also claimed that alien workers in Thailand have a higher tendency to commit crimes. Thailand's unemployment rate at the time was 1.9%.<ref>Public Relations Department, [http://thainews.prd.go.th/newsenglish/previewnews.php?news_id=254912080037 Democrat party labour group casts doubts on extension for foreign laboureres], 8 December 2006</ref><ref> The Irrawaddy, [http://www.thailabour.org/news/04072102.html Restrictions Eased for Migrant Workers in Thailand], 21 July 2004</ref><ref>[http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/companies/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&lvl2=comp&ArticleID=1518-1783_2041725 Thai jobless lowest in world], 7 December 2006</ref>

===Anti-drug policies===

Thaksin initiated several highly controversial policies to counter a boom in the Thai drug market, particularly in methamphetamine. After earlier anti-drug policies like border blocking (most methamphetamine is produced in Myanmar), public education, sports, and promoting peer pressure against drug use proved ineffective, Thaksin launched a multi-pronged suppression campaign that aimed to eradicate methamphetamine use in 3 months. The policy consisted of changing the punishment policy for drug addicts, setting provincial arrest and seizure targets, awarding government officials for achieving targets, targeting dealers, and "ruthless" implementation.

In the first three months, the Human Rights Watch reports that 2,275 people were killed.<ref></ref> The Government claimed that only around 50 of the deaths were at the hands of the police. Human rights critics say a large number were extrajudicially executed.<ref name=NYtimes2003april8>

According to the Narcotics Control Board, the policy was extremely effective in reducing drug consumption, especially in schools, at least until the 2006 coup.<ref>[http://www.mapinc.org/newscsdp/v05/n471/a09.html Thailand: Public Senses War On Drugs Futile] 20 March 2005</ref> 

King Bhumibol, in his 2003 birthday speech, supported Thaksin's anti-drugs approach, although he did request the commander of the police to categorize the deaths between those killed by police and those killed by fellow drug dealers.<ref> Royal Jubilee Network, [http://kanchanapisek.or.th/speeches/2003/1204.th.html 2003 Birthday Speech of King Bhumibol Adulyadej]</ref>  Police Commander Sant Sarutanond reopened investigations into the deaths, and again found that few of the deaths were at the hands of the police. A Bangkok university poll conducted in February 2003 revealed 92% of respondents backed Thaksin's approach.<ref></ref>   Nevertheless, his anti-drug approach was widely criticized by international community. Thaksin requested that the UN Commission on Human Rights send a special envoy to evaluate the situation, but said in an interview, "The United Nations is not my father. I am not worried about any UN visit to Thailand on this issue."<ref></ref>

A year after the 2006 coup, the military junta ordered another investigation into the anti-drug campaign. Former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakhon chaired the special investigative committee.  "The special committee will be tasked with an investigation to find out the truth about the deaths as well as to identify remedial measures for their relatives," said Justice Minister Charnchai Likhitjittha.<ref>''Bangkok Post,'' August 3, 2007. [http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=120634 "Kanit to chair extrajudicial killings probe"].</ref>

The committee found that as many as 1400 of the 2500 killed had no link to drugs. However, while giving the opinion that orders to kill came from the top, the panel failed to establish sufficient evidence to charge Thaksin directly with the murders.<ref name=economist24jan08> [http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10566797 "Thailand's drug wars.

===Corruption===
Transparency International reported that Thailand's reputation for transparency among business executives improved during the years of the Thaksin government. In 2001, Thailand's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) was 3.2 (ranked 61), whereas in 2005, the CPI was 3.8 (ranked 59).<ref>Thai Public Relations Department, "Thailand’s Image on Transparency", 26 October 2004</ref><ref>Transparency International [http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2005 TI 2005 Corruption Perceptions Index]</ref><ref>Transparency International, [http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2001 Corruption Perceptions Index 2001]</ref>
However the a study of Worldwide Governance Indicators by World Bank gave lower score on Control of Corruption during 2002-2005, Thaksin's government, compared to 1998-2000 of earlier government.<ref>[http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/pdf/c213.pdf Worldwide Governance Indicators]</ref>

===Education policies===

Thaksin implemented a major series of educational reforms during his government. Chief among those reforms was school decentralization, as mandated by the 1997 People's Constitution.<ref>[http://www.thaiembdc.org/politics/govtment/policy/54thpolicy/policy_e.html Thaksin Government 2001 Policy Statement, Section 11.1]</ref>
The policy was designed to delegated school management from the over-centralized and bureaucratized Ministry of Education to Tambon Administrative Organizations (TAOs). The plan met with massive widespread opposition from Thailand's 700,000 teachers, who would be deprived of their status as civil servants. There was also widespread fear from teachers that TAOs lack the skills and capabilities required to manage schools. In the face of massive teacher protests and several threats of school closure, Thaksin compromised and gave teachers whose schools were transferred to TAO management two years to transfer to other schools.<ref>[http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/article.php3?id_article=1009 Crisis in the ‘Land of the Smile’] International Viewpoint, Online magazine: IV376 - March 2006</ref>  

Other reforms included learning reform and related curricular decentralization, mostly through greater use of holistic education and less use of rote learning.<ref>[http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=19066 Thai News Agency, Rote learning to be eliminated from schools, says PM, 21 January 2006]</ref>

To increase access to universities for lower income people, Thaksin initiated the Student Loan Fund (SLF) and Income Contingency Loan (ICL) programs. The ICL granted loans regardless of financial status, and required recipients to start repayments when their salaries reach 16,000 Baht a month, with an interest rate equivalent to inflation from the day the loan was granted. The SLF had an eligibility limit on family income but carried interest of 1%, starting one year after graduation. The programs were merged and the income limit modified after Thaksin's government was overthrown.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/13/national/national_30018789.php New student loan scheme to have higher family-income limit], 13 November 2006</ref>

Thaksin also initiated the controversial "One District, One Dream School" project, aimed at developing the quality of schools to ensure that every district has at least one high-quality school. The project was criticized, with some claiming that the only beneficiaries were Thaksin and companies selling computers and educational equipment. Many schools also fell deeply into debt in implementing the project, receiving less than adequate financial support from the central government.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

In addition, Thaksin altered the state university entrance system. Whereas the former system relied exclusively on a series of nationally standardized exams, Thaksin pushed for a greater emphasis on senior high-school grades, claiming this would focus students on classroom learning rather than private entrance exam tutoring.

Thaksin initiated the Income Contingency Loan program to increase access to higher education. Under the program, needy students may secure a loan to support their studies from vocational to university levels. Thai banks had traditionally not given education loans. Thaksin made Thailand one of the first supporters of Nicholas Negroponte's One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project, with the Thai Ministry of Education committing to purchase 600,000 units.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/08/15/byteline/index.php?news=byteline_18342256.html The Nation, "CROSSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE: Sipa hopes for equal access for all children nationwide", 15 August 2005]</ref>  However, the military junta later cancelled the project.

===Energy policies===

In energy policy, the Thaksin government continued the power pool competition,<ref>[http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/ffd/domestic/2001/0927trump.htm Far Eastern Economic Review, "Power Politics Trump Reform", 27 September 2001]</ref> Thaksin's policies aimed to create national champions that could reliably support stronger economic growth and become important players in regional energy markets.<ref>[http://my.reset.jp/~adachihayao/040503C.htm Bangkok Post, "Raising sector efficiency `crucial': Utility's B140bn debt strains public purse"]</ref>  Thaksin also initiated a policy to encourage renewable energy and energy conservation. Many Thaksin-era energy policies were reversed following the 2006 coup.

===South Thailand insurgency===

A resurgence in violence began in 2001 in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand which all have a Muslim, ethnic Malay majority. There is much controversy about the causes of this escalation of the decades long insurgency. Attacks after 2001 concentrated on police, the military, and schools, but civilians have also been targets. Thaksin has been widely criticized for his management of the situation, in particular the storming of the Krue Se Mosque, the deaths of civilian protesters at Tak Bai in Army custody, and the unsolved kidnapping of Muslim-lawyer Somchai Neelapaijit.<ref>The New York Times, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E4DA123CF931A15754C0A9639C8B63&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fT%2fThaksin%20Shinawatra U.N. Criticizes Emergency Powers], Warren Hoge, July 22, 2005</ref>  

In October 2004, 84 Muslim human rights protesters were killed at Tak Bai when the Army broke up a peaceful protest.<ref>[http://www.ahrchk.net/ua/mainfile.php/2004/838/ At least 84 people killed in Southern Thailand] 26 October 2004</ref> The many detainees were forced at gunpoint to lie prone in Army trucks, stacked like cordwood. The trucks were delayed from moving to the detainment area for hours. Many detainees suffocated to death due to gross mishandling by the military. After the 2006 coup, the Army dropped all charges and investigations into Army misconduct related to the Tak Bai incident. Thaksin announced an escalation of military and police activity in the region.<ref>Somchai Phatharathananunth "Civil Society and Democratization" p.222 </ref> In July 2005, Thaksin enacted an Emergency Decree to manage the three troubled provinces. Several human rights organizations expressed their concerns that the decree might be used to violate civil liberties.<ref></ref>  

In March 2005, Thaksin established the National Reconciliation Commission, chaired by former Prime Minister Islamic law and making Pattani-Malay (Yawi) an official language in the region. The Thaksin administration assigned a government committee to study the report, while Muslims urged the government to act faster in implementing the proposals.<ref></ref>

===Administrative reform===
====Ministerial restructuring====
One of the most visible of Thaksin's administrative reforms was the restructuring of government department and ministries, labeled the "big bang."  It was hailed as a "historic breakthrough" and "the first major reorganization of ministries since King Chulalongkorn set up Thailand’s modern system of departmental government in 1897." Such a restructuring had been studied for years as a means of undermining the perceived rigidities and inertia of the old system, but was never implemented until the Thaksin government.<ref>Martin Painter, Managerial Reform and Political Control: the Case of Thaksin and the Thai Bureaucracy*, Department of Public and Social Administration, City University of Hong Kong, [http://www.sog-rc27.org/Paper/Scancor/Martin_Painter.doc http://www.sog-rc27.org/Paper/Scancor/Martin_Painter.doc]</ref>

The restructuring was designed to streamline the bureaucracy and focus it on performance and results. New ministries were carved out in Social and Human Security Development, Tourism and Sports, Natural Resources and Environment, Information and Communication Technology, and Culture.

====CEO-governors====
Thaksin transformed the role of provincial governors from ceremonial supervisors of ministry officials to active managers of government policy. Historically, central government ministries operated in the provinces through field offices headed by senior officials, who reported back to Bangkok. The Ministry of Interior appointed provincial governors whose role was largely ceremonial.

A key component of Thaksin's administrative reform policy, "CEO-governors" epitomized Thaksin's "transformation of the operating style of the traditional bureaucracy into a more results-oriented instrument that would be responsive." Piloted in 2001 and introduced in all provinces in October 2003, CEO-governors were put in charge of planning and coordinating provincial development and became accountable for overall provincial affairs. The "CEO governors" were assisted by "provincial CFOs" from the Ministry of Finance who reported directly to each governor. The CEO-Governors were authorized to raise funds by issuing bonds and were given an intensive training course.<ref></ref>  After the coup, the junta reverted the role of governors.

===Foreign policies===

Thaksin was fiercely attacked for tasking diplomats with supporting domestic economic programs, e.g., promoting OTOP products. Surapong Jayanama, former ambassador to Vietnam claiming that Thaksin's policies were "demeaning" and would do little to enhance Thailand's international stature.<ref></ref> 

Thaksin also initiated negotiations for several free trade agreements with China, Australia, Bahrain, India, and the US. This policy was also criticized, with claims that high-cost Thai industries could be wiped out.<ref>[http://www.ftawatch.org/ FTA Watch Group website]</ref>

Thailand joined George W. Bush's multinational coalition in the invasion of Iraq, sending a 423-strong humanitarian contingent. It withdrew its troops on 10 September 2004. Two Thai soldiers died in Iraq in an insurgent attack.

thumb|200px|right|Thaksin Shinawatra
'''Thaksin Shinawatra''' Thai: ทักษิณ ชินวัตร (født 26. juli 1949 i Sankamphaeng i Chiang Mai-provinsen), er en thailandsk politiker og den nuværende statsminister i landet og leder for populistpartiet Thai Rak Thai. Som chef for firmaet Shin Corporation, som bl.a. kontrollerer Thailands største mobiltelefonoperatør, Advanced Info Service, er han også landets rigeste person.

Thaksin er tidligere overløjtnant i det thailandske politi, med graden ''master in criminal justice'' fra Eastern Kentucky University i USA og Ph.D. fra Sam Houston State University, USA.

Partileder i det politiske partiet Palang Dharma fra 1996, og leder for Thai Rak Thais fra 1998. Han fik sin første regeringspost i 1994, da han tjente som udenrigsminister. Han blev statsminister 9. februar 2001.

== Omstridt ==
Thaksin Shinawatra er en omstridt toppolitiker i Thailand, men har længe haft stor støtte i dele af befolkningen, især i den nord-østlige del af Thailand - bedere kendt under betegnelsen/navnet Isarn, der også udgører omkring 40% af Thailands samlede befolkning. 

I 2006 blev Thaksin udsat for massiv kritik efter han solgte et telecom-selskab og tjente et milliardbeløb (73,4 mia. Thai Baht) uden at betale skat af beløbet, sideløbende med der var tydelige tegn på nepotisme, især i forbindelse med statsejet jord, der blev solgt til Thaksins kone til priser under markeds værdien.  Kritikken førte til en politisk krise for Thaksin, som blev tvunget til at udskrive nyvalg i landet for at prøve at skaffe mandat til at fortsætte som statsminister. Valget odviklede sig dog til noget af en farce,  da det i realiteten kun var Thaksins eget parti der opstillede, da valget blev boykottet af alle opotitions partierne. 

19. september 2006 gennemførte en mindre gruppe militærpersoner et statskup, samtidig med, at statsministeren var i FN.
