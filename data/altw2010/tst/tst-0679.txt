'''Crystal Gayle''' (born American country singer best known for a series of country-pop crossover hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including the Grammy Award-winning, "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue." She accumulated 18 No. 1 country hits during the 1970s and 1980s. She is also famous for her nearly floor-length hair and was voted one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world in 1983. She is the sister of singer Loretta Lynn (who is 17 years her senior) and the distant cousin of singer Patty Loveless. 

==Biography and career==
===Early years===
Crystal Gayle was born Brenda Gail Webb in Paintsville, Kentucky, USA, on January 9, 1951, the youngest daughter of Melvin "Ted" and Clara Marie (Ramey) Webb.<ref name="AMG"> [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:difwxql5ldse~T1 Crystal Gayle biography at All Music Guide] </ref> Her sister, country music legend Loretta Lynn, was raised in nearby rural Butcher Holler and had already married and left home by the time Webb was born.<ref name="AMG" /> Webb's family moved to Wabash, Indiana when she was four. 

Inspired by Lynn's success, Webb learned guitar, performed folk songs in high school and sang backing vocals in her brother's band.<ref name="AMG" /> Lynn encouraged her younger sister by bringing her out on tour for a few weeks each summer. Lynn's label, Decca, signed the young singer after she completed high school, but suggested a name change to avoid confusion with labelmate Brenda Lee. Lynn suggested the name Crystal, inspired by the Krystal hamburger chain, and Webb adopted her middle name to derive "Crystal Gayle".<ref name="AMG" />

===1970 &ndash; 1977: Country beginnings===
Gayle's debut single, ''I've Cried (The Blues Right Out of My Eyes)'', was released in 1970 peaking at No. 23 on Billboard's Country singles chart.  The song was written by Loretta Lynn and performed in a style very similar to her sister's.  Decca pushed for more records styled like Lynn's with Lynn actually writing more of her early singles. Unfortunately, this approach failed to establish Gayle in her own right even with regular appearances on Jim Ed Brown's television show ''The Country Place''.<ref name="CMT"> [http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/gayle_crystal/bio.jhtml Crystal Gayle at CMT.com] biography (retrieved January 24, 2007) </ref>  She did not return to the Country Top 40 until 1974's ''Restless'' (No. 39).  

Frustrated, she parted ways with Decca and signed with United Artists in 1974 where she teamed with producer Crystal Gayle'', was released in 1974 yielding her first Top Ten country hit, ''Wrong Road Again'' (No. 6).  By 1976, Gayle amassed the first of her 18 Number One country singles, ''I'll Get Over You'',<ref name="CMT" /> which also became her first single to reach Billboard's Hot 100 (No. 71) and Adult Contemporary chart (No. 40).  She scored two more Top 2 country hits, "You Never Miss A Real Good Thing (Till He Says Goodbye)" (No. 1) and "I'll Do It All Over Again" (No. 2), in 1977 before achieving the greatest success of her career.

===1977 &ndash; 1989: Crossover===
Believing Gayle was poised for a larger breakthrough, Reynolds encouraged her to record the jazz-flavored ballad, ''Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue''. The song became the most successful of Gayle's career spending four weeks atop the country chart.  The song became her biggest hit on the Hot 100 (No. 2), peaked at No. 4 AC and gained considerable airplay worldwide.  Gayle earned a Grammy award for ''Best Female Country Vocal Performance'' and the song also earned a Grammy as Country Song of the Year for its writer, Richard Leigh.<ref name="AMG" /> The song helped her album, ''We Must Believe in Magic'', become the first by a female country artist to be certified platinum.<ref name="CMT"> She toured worldwide, including Britain with Kenny Rogers and China with Bob Hope, where she became the first person to tape a performance on the Great Wall of China. 

After the success of ''Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue'', Gayle and her record producers leaned more toward crossover music with each new release. For the next ten years, she would have her greatest success.  Gayle was awarded "Female Vocalist of the Year" for two years by the Country Music Association Awards (1978 and 1979) and for three years by the Academy of Country Music (1976 &ndash; 1977 and 1979). 

Gayle remade a previously recorded track from her ''Crystal'' album, ''Ready For The Times To Get Better,'' as her first single after ''United Artists for Columbia Records in 1979 for her next album, ''Miss The Mississippi.'' She returned again to the Pop Top 20 with that album's first single, ''Half The Way'' (No. 15 Pop, No. 2 Country, No. 9 AC) <ref name="AMG" /> which became her last solo Top 20 Pop hit.  

Gayle started the 1980s with another No. 1 country hit, ''It's Like We Never Said Goodbye'' (No. 63 Pop, No. 17 AC). This song led a historic Top 5 on the Billboard Country Singles chart on which the Top 5 positions were all held by women:

#'''Crystal Gayle ("It's Like We Never Said Goodbye")'''
#Dottie West ("A Lesson In Leavin'")
#Debby Boone ("Are You On The Road To Lovin' Me Again")
#Emmylou Harris ("Beneath Still Waters")
#Tammy Wynette ("Two Story House" with George Jones)

Gayle's next album, ''Hollywood, Tennessee,'' was her most blatant attempt at country crossover. The album's A-side, ''Hollywood'', was pop while the album's B-side, ''Tennessee'', was country. The album's three singles all reached the Country Top 10, but only the first single, ''The Woman In Me,'' reached the Hot 100 (No. 76). Gayle's singles, however, frequently charted Top 20 on the AC chart throughout the 1980s. 

In 1982, Gayle worked on the True Love'', surprisingly excluded this duet.  It did produce three more No. 1 country hits - ''Til I Gain Control Again,'' ''Our Love Is On The Faultline'' (No. 23 AC) and ''Baby, What About You'' (No. 83 Pop, No. 9 AC). 

After Elektra Records was folded into Dallas'' television series. The song, ''Makin' Up For Lost Time (The Dallas Lovers' Song),'' reached No. 1 Country, but became Gayle's last AC chart appearance (No. 36) to date. 

Her 1986 album, ''Straight To The Heart,'' began promisingly with two more No. 1 Country singles - ''Cry'' (a remake of the Johnnie Ray classic) and the title track. These songs, however, would become the last of Gayle's 18 No. 1 Country singles. She reunited with Gary Morris in 1987 to record the album, ''What If We Fall In Love,'' which would yield another theme from a television soap opera, ''Another World'' (No. 4). Gayle guest-starred on the show as herself, a friend of the character Felicia Gallant, who was menaced by a serial killer known as the "Sin Stalker." Gayle and Morris performed the theme at the Daytime Emmy Awards and the song was used as the show's theme until March 1996. 

''Another World'' became Gayle's last Top 10 Country hit to date. As traditional Country singers such as Randy Travis and the Judds began to dominate the country airwaves in the late 1980s, the success of crossover artists like Gayle began to wane. Gayle's last charted single was 1990's ''Never Ending Song Of Love'' (No. 72).

===1990 &ndash; present: Later career===
Gayle released two more studio albums during the 1990s:  ''Ain't Gonna Worry'' (1990) produced by Allen Reynolds and ''Three Good Reasons'' (1992).  Both albums failed to chart and their singles all failed to reestablish Gayle at country radio.  Gayle subsequently recorded several specialty projects.  She released two gospel albums - ''Someday'' (1995) and ''He Is Beautiful'' (1997).  In 1999, she released the tribute album, ''Crystal Gayle Sings The Heart And Soul Of Hoagy Carmichael''.<ref> [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:difwxql5ldse~T1 Crystal Gayle at All Music Guide] </ref>.  Gayle released a children's album, ''In My Arms'', in 2000.  Her most recent studio album was the 2003 standards collection, ''All My Tomorrows''.  Gayle has since released two live albums, ''Crystal Gayle In Concert'' (2005) and ''Live! An Evening With Crystal Gayle'' (2007). 

In January 2007, Gayle became involved in the hunt for fugitive Christopher Gay.  Gay escaped from custody at an Interstate 95 welcome center near Hardeeville, South Carolina and made his way to Tennessee where he stole Gayle's tour bus.  Gay drove the bus from Old Hickory, Tennessee to the Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, parking the bus in a VIP spot next to NASCAR Nextel Cup driver Jeff Gordon. Gay was arrested the following day and the bus was returned to Gayle.<ref>Russell, Steven. "The Last Outlaw (The Ballad of Christopher Gay)". ''Maxim'' August 2007. pp. 102-8.</ref>

'''Crystal Gayle''' (* US-amerikanische Country-Sängerin, die vor allem in den 1970er und 1980er Jahren erfolgreich war. Sie stand viele Jahre im Schatten ihrer Schwester Loretta Lynn, bevor sie mit Country-Pop-Songs hohe Verkaufszahlen erreichen konnte.

== Anfänge ==
Als Crystal Gayle geboren wurde, hatte ihre fast 17 Jahre ältere Schwester Loretta Lynn bereits ihre ersten Schallplatten veröffentlicht. Crystal –&nbsp;der Name entstand aus ihrer Vorliebe für Hamburger der gleichnamigen Kette&nbsp;– begleitete ihre berühmte Schwester erstmals im Alter von 16 Jahren auf Tournee. Es folgten regelmäßige Fernsehauftritte. 1970 wurde mit dem Decca-Label ein Schallplattenvertrag abgeschlossen. Ihre erste Single war ein Cover des früheren Loretta-Lynn-Songs ''I've Cried The Blue Right Out Of My Eyes'' und erreichte einen mittleren Platz in den Country-Top-100. Erst durch einen Wechsel zum Label United Artists Records 1973 und einen radikaler Stilwandel hin zum Country-Pop konnte sie aus dem Schatten der Schwester treten.

== Karriere ==
Bei United Artists wurde Gayle vom Produzenten und Songwriter Allen Reynolds betreut, der zuvor mit Don Gibson zusammengearbeitet hatte. Unter Reynolds behutsamer Anleitung wurden leisere und sanftere Töne angeschlagen, die auch außerhalb der Country-Szene akzeptiert werden konnten, da in dieser Zeit Pop-Einflüsse die Country-Musik dominierten.

Bereits mit einer ihrer ersten Singles, mit dem von Reynolds geschriebenen ''Wrong Road Again'', gelang ihr der Einstieg in die Top-10. Der Erfolg konnte mit einem weiteren Song ihres Produzenten, ''Somebody Loves You'', wiederholt werden. 1976 gelang ihr mit ''I'll Get Over You'' der erste Nummer-1-Hit. Ihren endgültigen Durchbruch schaffte sie ein Jahr später mit ''Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue''. Der Song erreichte Platz Eins der Country-Charts, platzierte sich hoch in der Pop-Hitparade und wurde mit zwei Grammys ausgezeichnet. Ihr Album ''We Must Believe In Magic'' erreichte Platin-Status. Von der Country Music Association wurde Crystal Gayle zur „Country-Sängerin des Jahres“ gewählt.

Das Jahr 1978 war erneut sehr erfolgreich. Drei ihrer Songs schafften die Spitzenposition der Country-Charts. Wieder gab es zahlreiche Auszeichnungen, darunter den Academy of Country Music Award „Sängerin des Jahres“ und erneut einen CMA-Award. 1979 unternahm sie als erster Country-Star eine Tournee durch China. Im gleichen Jahr wechselte sie gemeinsam mit ihrem Produzenten Reynolds zum Columbia-Label. Hier konnten sie nahtlos an die alten Erfolge anknüpfen. Auch in den 1980er Jahren gab es weitere Nummer-1-Hits, darunter der mit Eddie Rabbitt im Duett gesungene ''You And I''. Ihren letzten Top-Hit hatte sie 1987 mit ''Straight To The Heart''. Nach mehreren Label-Wechseln kehrte sie 1990 kurzzeitig zu Columbia und Allen Reynolds zurück, wo sie mit ''Never Ending Song Of Love'' ihre letzte Chartposition verbuchen konnte.
