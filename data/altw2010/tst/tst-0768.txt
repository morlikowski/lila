Le '''rock sudiste''' est un genre de rock qui fut très populaire durant les années 1970.

Aux origines du rock, le Sud des États-Unis est omniprésent d'Elvis Presley à Jerry Lee Lewis en passant par Little Richard. Les années 1960 changent la donne avec la vague britannique puis la montée en puissance du folk et du rock psychédélique qui mettent en avant des villes comme New York, Los Angeles ou San Francisco. 

Originaires de Géorgie, The Allman Brothers Band qui débute avec son blues rock en 1969, tente de remonter aux racines du rock en l'agrémentant de longs solos et de duels de guitare entre Dickie Betts et Duane Allman, à la manière des jams de jazz. Ils introduisent également dans leur musique de la country et du folk et mettent au monde un nouveau genre musical : le rock sudiste.

A partir des années 1970, de nombreux groupes utilisent ces bases pour agrémenter leur rock, toujours dominé par d'omniprésentes chevauchées de guitares (avec la présence fréquente de trois guitaristes solistes par formation)  et marquer leur identité culturelle sudiste, en référence au .38 Special, Point Blank, Doc Holliday, Rebel Meets Rebel et The Outlaws (groupe américain), notamment.

ZZ Top, trio texan dont les membres sont fiers de leurs images de cow-boys du Rio Grande, a été parfois assimilé à ce mouvement musical sudiste, mais doit en être distingué tant sur un plan culturel (les influences latino-américaines propres au Texas sont omniprésentes notamment dans les premiers albums) que musical (la formule du power trio ne correspond pas vraiment aux archétypes du rock sudiste). Le leader du groupe, Billy Gibbons, avait d'ailleurs mis les choses au point en ce sens lors d'une interview à un journal français au début des années 1980.

Aujourd'hui, quelques groupes comme Rebel Pride, Blackberry Smoke ou encore Gov't Mule perpétuent le son sudiste ...

'''Southern rock''' is a subgenre of rock music. It developed in the Southern United States from rock and roll, country music, and blues, and is focused generally on electric guitar and vocals.

==1950s and 1960s &ndash; origins==
Rock music's origins lie mostly in the music of Southerners, and many stars from the first wave of 1950s rock and roll such as Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Bo Diddley and Jerry Lee Lewis hailed from the Deep South. But the British Invasion, and the rise of folk rock and psychedelic rock in the middle 1960s, shifted the focus of new rock music away from the rural south and to large cities like Liverpool, London, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco.

In the late 1960s, traditionalists such as Canadian, though drummer Arkansan) revived interest in the roots of rock. See Muscle Shoals Music.

==1970s &ndash; peak of popularity==
Attention once again turned to bands from the American South. classical music, and on the other hand drew from native elements of country and folk. The death of guitarist and leader Duane Allman in 1971 did not prevent them from gaining popularity for the next several years, until internal tensions broke them apart after 1976. Because a certain type of blues music, and essentially, rock and roll, was invented in the South,<ref name="history">{{cite video

The Allman Brothers were signed to Wet Willie from Elvin Bishop Band from Oklahoma.

Loosely associated with this first wave of Southern rock were acts like Charlie Daniels Band from Tennessee. Charlie Daniels, a big-bearded fiddler with a knack for novelty songs, gave Southern rock its self-identifying anthem with his 1975 hit, "The South's Gonna Do It", whose lyrics mentioned all of the above bands, proclaiming: "Be proud you're a rebel / 'Cause the South's gonna do it again."
A year earlier, Daniels had started the Volunteer Jam, an annual Southern rock-themed concert held in Tennessee. The Winters Brothers Band from Franklin, Tenn. was a band Charlie Daniels helped to get started with "Sang Her Love Songs", "Smokey Mountain Log Cabin Jones," and more. They still perform and hold an annual festival in Nolensville, Tennessee every year.

In the early 1970s, another wave of heavy metal, along with lyrics concerning the values, aspirations - and excesses - of Southern working-class young adults, not unlike the .38 Special, Blackfoot, Point Blank and Black Oak Arkansas also thrived in this genre.

The Allman Brothers Southern feel came more from the temperament of its music ("presidency; Carter claimed to be a fan of the Allman Brothers. Even within the Skynyrd branch of Southern rock, the appearance of Molly Hatchet on the dance-oriented show ''Solid Gold'' hinted at the wider level of popularity Southern rock had achieved.

Not all Southern rock artists fit into the above molds. The Sea Level explored jazz fusion.

==1980s and 1990s &ndash; continuing influence==
Southern rock gained popularity far beyond the American south, and influenced groups as far flung as Australia's AC/DC, whose original vocalist, Bon Scott was known to wear rebel flag belt buckles at concerts.

However, by the beginning of the 1980s, with the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd both broken, with Capricorn Records in bankruptcy, and with Jimmy Carter out of office, much of Southern rock had become thoroughly enmeshed into corporate New Wave, and glam metal, most surviving Southern rock groups were relegated to secondary or regional venues. Bands such as Better Than Ezra, Drivin N Cryin, Cowboy Mouth, Dash Rip Rock and Third Day emerged as popular Southern bands across the Southeastern United States during the 80's and 90's. One notable exception was the The Georgia Satellites who had some popularity in the mid to late 1980s. 

During the 1990s, the Allman Brothers reunified and became a strong touring and recording presence again, and the jam band scene revived interest in extended improvised music (although the scene also owed much to the Grateful Dead, a group that relied heavily on Southern music traditions). Incarnations of Lynyrd Skynyrd also made themselves heard. Hard rock groups with Southern rock touches such as Jackyl renewed some interest in Southern rock. Classic rock radio stations played some of the more familiar 1970s works, and Charlie Daniels's Volunteer Jam concerts were still going. Phil Walden resurrected Capricorn Records only to fall back into bankruptcy. One of the final Capricorn issues was a solo effort by former Wet Willie front man [http://www.jimmyhall.com Jimmy Hall] entitled Rendezvous With The Blues. With the demise of Capricorn this much sought after album fell off the shelves until a fortunate 2006 re-release with bonus tracks. 

But some rock groups from the South, such as Georgia's R.E.M., B-52's, Widespread Panic, and Black Crowes, Florida's Sister Hazel, and Mississippi's Blind Melon, incorporated Southern musical and lyrical themes without explicitly allying with any Southern rock movement.

The 90s also saw the influence of Southern rock touching metal. Early in the decade several bands from the Southern United States (particularly New Orleans with its metal scene)<ref name="allmusic-doometal">{{cite web|url=http://wm04.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=77:11956|
