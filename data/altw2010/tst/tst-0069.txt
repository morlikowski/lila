The government of South Korea is divided into three branches: executive, judicial, and legislative. The executive and legislative branches operate primarily at the national level, although various ministries in the executive branch also carry out local functions. Local governments are semi-autonomous, and contain executive and legislative bodies of their own. The judicial branch operates at both the national and local levels.

The South Korean government's structure is determined by the election was held in 1987. The CIA World Factbook describes South Korea's democracy as a "fully functioning modern democracy".<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ks.html CIA World Factbook</ref>

==History==
===Before division===

Archeological findings indicate that the Korean Peninsula was occupied by humans as early in the Lower Paleolithic period. 

Korea began with the founding of Joseon(The name Gojoseon is almost always used to prevent confusion with another Joseon dynasty founded in 14th century; the prefix Go- means 'old' or 'earlier') in 2333 BC by Dangun.<ref>[http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm Korea's History (Ko-Choson, Three Kingdoms, Parhae Kingdom, Unified Shilla, Koryo Dynasty, Colonial Period, Independence Struggle, Provisional Government of Korea, Independence Army, Republic of Korea,)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Gojoseon expanded until it controlled much of the northern Korean peninsula and parts of Manchuria. After numerous wars with the Chinese Han Dynasty, Gojoseon disintegrated, leading to the Proto-Three Kingdoms of Korea period.  

In the early centuries of the Common Era, Buyeo, the Three Kingdoms.

Introduction of Silla in 676 led to the North-South States period, in which the much of the Korean peninsula was controlled by Khitan in 926.

After the North-South Period, successor states fought for control during the Wang Geon of Goryeo. Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state and  created the Jikji in 1377, using the world's oldest movable metal printing press.<ref>[http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php URL_ID=3946&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html World's oldest printed Doc]</ref>

The Mongol invasions in the 13th century greatly weakened Goryeo. However, Goryeo continued to rule Korea as a tributary ally to the Mongols. After the fall of the Mongolian Empire (Yi Seong-gye.

General Yi declared the new name of Korea as Joseon in reference to Sejong the Great in the 14 century and the rise and influence of Confucianism.

In the latter of the 16th century, Joseon was invaded by a newly unified Japan. During the Joseon government and generals led to the destruction of much of the Korean peninsula. However, continued Korean dominance at sea led by Admiral Yi, the rise of local militias, and the intervention of Ming China put Japan under great pressure to retreat in 1598. 

Today, Admiral Yi is celebrated as one of Korea's foremost heroes and his turtle ships, used with great success against the Japanese, are considered the world's first ironclad warships, although lack of hard evidence of iron plating sparks much debate.

During the last years of the Joseon Dynasty, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the name the "Hermit Kingdom", primarily for protection against Western imperialism.

===After division===

In the aftermath of World War II,  Soviet Union and United States troops controlled the northern and southern halves of the country respectively. The two Cold War rivals established governments sympathetic to their own ideologies, leading to Korea's division into two political entities: North Korea and South Korea.

Despite the initial plan of a unified Korea in the 1943 Cairo Declaration, escalating Cold War antagonism eventually led to the establishment of two separate governments: the communist North and the capitalist South.  In the North, a former anti-Japanese guerilla and communist activist, Kim Il-sung<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/65/ki/KimIlSun.html Kim Il Sung.

On China backed demilitarized zone near the original demarcation line. No peace treaty was ever signed, and the two countries are still technically at war.<ref></ref>

In 1960, a student uprising led to the resignation of the autocratic and corrupt President military coup (the "5.16 coup d'état") against the weak and ineffectual government the next year. Park took over as president until his assassination in 1979, overseeing rapid export-led economic growth as well as severe political repression. Park is heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, although the Korean economy developed significantly during his tenure.

The years after Park's assassination were marked by, again, considerable political turmoil as the previously repressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1980, there was a seizure of power triggered nationwide protest demanding Gwangju Massacre.

The period of resistance is called the Resistance of June when all joined the national movement.  Eventually, Chun's party, the Democratic Justice Party, and its leader, Roh Tae-woo announced the June 29th Declaration, which included the direct election of the president.<ref> http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?gs=ws&gd=&cd=&q=&p=&masterno=211762&contentno=211762 Encyber Encyclopedia article on June 29th Declaration </ref>

In 1988, Seoul hosted the OECD, a testament to further economic growth. As with many of its Asian neighbors, South Korea suffered the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, but the country was able to re-emerge and continue its growth towards a major economic power after a swift recovery.<ref> http://www.korea.net/news/news/newsView.asp?serial_no=20071108002&part=104&SearchDay=&page=1 Korea.net article on East Asian Financial Crisis </ref>

==Foreign relations==

thumb|left|220px|[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General of the President of the United States, George W. Bush.]]
===United States===
The United States of America engaged in the decolonization of Korea (mainly South, Soviet Union engaged North Korea) from Japan after World War II. After 3 years of military administration by the United States, the South Korean government was established. 
Upon the onset of the Korean War, the United States sent soldiers to South Korea to defend against the invasion of North Korea and later China. Since then, the two nations have had strong economic, diplomatic and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regards to policies towards North Korea. Currently, the US Naval Forces Korea are stationed in South Korea.

===China===
Historically, Korea has had relatively close relations with China. Before the formation of South Korea, Korean independence fighters worked with Chinese soldiers during the Japanese occupation. However, after World War II, the Chinese embraced Maoism while South Korea became a representative democracy under the influence of the United States. The People's Republic of China assisted North Korea with manpower and supplies during the Korean War, and in its aftermath the diplomatic relationship between South Korea and China almost completely ceased. Relations thawed gradually, however, and South Korea and China re-established formal diplomatic relations on August 24, 1992. The two countries sought to improve bilateral relations and lifted the forty-year old trade embargo, and<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/FI11Dg03.html Asia Times - News and analysis from Korea; North and South<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> South Korean-Chinese relations have improved steadily since 1992.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

===Japan===
Although there were no formal diplomatic ties between South Korea and Japan after the Korean War, South Korea and Japan signed the Japanese occupation. During Japanese textbooks to overlook Japanese aggression during World War II, and the territorial disputes over Prime Minister President Roh Moo-hyun suspended all summit talks between South Korea and Japan.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/Korean/archive/2006-03/2006-03-17-voa12.cfm 노무현 대통령, “고이즈미 일본총리가 신사참배 중단하지 않으면 정상회담도 없을 것” (영문기사 첨부)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===North Korea===
Both North and South Korea continue to officially claim sovereignty over the entire peninsula and any outlying islands. With longstanding animosity following the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, North Korea and South Korea signed an agreement to pursue peace.<ref name="autogenerated4"></ref> On October 4, 2007, Roh Moo-Hyun and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il signed an eight-point peace agreement on issues of permanent peace, high-level talks, economic cooperation, renewal of train services, highway and air travel, and a joint Olympic cheering squad.<ref name="autogenerated4" />

Despite the Sunshine Policy and efforts at reconciliation, the progress was complicated by 1993, 1998, and again in 2006. Recently, North Korea agreed to temporarily suspend its pursuit of a nuclear weapons program for economic and diplomatic support, although some Korean and American officials criticized the North for not being fully cooperative in its temporary suspension of a nuclear weapons program.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,251618,00.html FOXNews.com - North Korea Agrees to End Nuke Program - International News | News of the World | Middle East News | Europe News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Other nations===
South Korea maintains diplomatic relations with approximately 170 countries.  The country has also been a member of the UN Secretary-General. It has also developed links with Association of Southeast Asian Nations as both a member of ''ASEAN Plus three,'' a body of observers, and the East Asia Summit (EAS).

There is an ongoing effort at negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with the European Union, the second largest importer of Korean goods.<ref>[http://www.bilaterals.org/article.php3?id_article=5202 Korea-EU FTA promoted at luncheon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> South Korea is also negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with Canada.<ref>[http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/korea-coree/index.aspx?lang=en Canada-Korea - Free Trade Agreement Negotiations<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The South Korean military consists of the Army (ROKA), the Navy (ROKN), the Air Force (ROKAF), and the Marine Corps (ROKMC), together with reserve forces.<ref> GlobalSecurity on Military of Republic of Korea http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/rok/index.html</ref> Many of these forces are concentrated near the border with North Korea, near the demilitarized zone. All South Korean males are constitutionally required to serve in the military, typically for a period of two years. However, there have been debates about shortening the length of the military services, and even dismissing the mandatory service itself. The government recently allowed some male students who were in the process of earning a university bachelor's degree and master's degree to dismiss the military requirements to allow them to further study and research their fields.

From time to time, South Korea has sent its troops overseas to assist American forces. It has participated in most major conflicts that the United States has been involved in the past 50 years.  South Korea dispatched 320,000 troops to fight alongside American, Filipino, and coalition forces after only the US and Britain.<ref>[http://www.army.mil.kr:7081/zaytun2/english/index.jsp Zaytun Division official website]</ref>

==Geography and climate==

thumb|right|220px|[[Seoraksan mountain in Gangwondo.]]

South Korea occupies the southern portion of the Korean Peninsula, which extends some 680 miles (1,100&nbsp;km) from the Asian mainland. This mountainous peninsula is flanked by the Yellow Sea to the west, and the Sea of Japan (East Sea) to the east. Its southern tip lies on the Korea Strait and the East China Sea. 

The country's total area is .<ref>The estimated area rises steadily from year to year, possibly due to land reclamation. </ref>

South Korea can be divided into four general regions: an eastern region of high mountain ranges and narrow river basins, and rolling hills; a southwestern region of mountains and valleys; and a southeastern region dominated by the broad basin of the Nakdong River. 

South Korea's terrain is mostly mountainous, most of which is not arable. Lowlands, located primarily in the west and southeast, constitute only 30% of the total land area. 

About three thousand islands, mostly small and uninhabited, lie off the western and southern coasts of South Korea. Dokdo, while Ieodo are the southernmost islands of South Korea.

In C to 1 °C (19 °F to 33 °F), and the average July temperature range is 22 °C to 29 °C (71 °F to 83 °F). Winter temperatures are higher along the southern coast and considerably lower in the mountainous interior. Rainfall is concentrated in the summer months of June through September. The southern coast is subject to late summer typhoons that bring strong winds and heavy rains. The average annual precipitation varies from  1,370 millimeters (54&nbsp;inches) in Seoul to 1,470 millimeters (58&nbsp;inches) in Busan. There are occasional typhoons that bring high winds and floods. The government is concerned of the impact of global warming on the natural disasters.

===Environment===
In the past, urban areas such as Seoul had minor problems associated with air pollution and water pollution. However, the Mayor of Seoul has been working hard to restore the flow of clean water in South Korea, by recovering the flow of Cheonggyecheon in central Seoul, for example.<ref>[http://english.seoul.go.kr/gover/initiatives/inti_02cheon.htm Seoul Metropolitan Government - "A Clean, Attractive & Global City, Seoul!"<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> South Korea is a member of numerous international environmental organizations with specific regards to Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution (MARPOL 73/78), Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, and Whaling.<ref></ref>

===Economic history===
In the 1950s South Korea was one of the poorest countries in Asia; its infrastructure and resources were severely exploited during the Japanese occupation and completely destroyed by the Korean War. However, following the military coup led by General Park Chung-hee in 1962, South Korea became for four straight decades one of the fastest-growing economies in world history, completely transforming it from a farming and fishing based economy into one of the world's most high-tech industrial powers.

Rapid expansion in light industries, which were later followed by subsequent development in heavy industries, made South Korea in 1973 the 34th wealthiest country in the world.<ref>[http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_gdp_per_cap_in_197-economy-gdp-per-capita-1973 NationMaster - NationMaster Survey<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Park's government plans for economic development greatly boosted the Korean economy. This growth is often called the "Han River being the main river that runs through the nation's capital and largest city, digital monitors, mobile phones, and semiconductors.

The South Korean model of encouraging the growth of large, internationally competitive financial services companies, business groups, and banks through easy financing and tax incentives led the South Korean economy to be dominated by family-controlled conglomerates. These companies, known as Hyundai, Samsung, LG and SK Company became global corporations.

Since the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis the corporate landscape has changed considerably as a result of massive bankruptcies and government reforms. The crisis exposed longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's economy, including high debt-to-equity ratios, massive foreign borrowing, and an undisciplined financial sector. This led to two rounds of financial and industrial restructuring; one in 1997 and another following the collapse of Daewoo in 1999.<ref>KOIS (2003), pp. 238-239.</ref> Daewoo's collapse has been recorded as one of the largest bankruptcies in world history.<ref>[http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?ResearchID=458] Paper: Economic Reform in South Korea: An Unfinished Legacy</ref> By 2003, just over one-half of the 30 largest chaebol from 1995 remained.<ref>18 out of 30, according to </ref>
