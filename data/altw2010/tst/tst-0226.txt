This short version title is a precursor to Polyphony Digital's planned ''Gran Turismo 5'' and replaces ''Gran Turismo HD Concept''.

The "spec II" version was released in North America on April 15 2008 (Blu-ray Disc) and was released on April 17 (Playstation Store). The Blu-ray Disc version will offer added value with an exclusive GT-TV video feature called "Beyond the Apex".<ref>[http://www.us.playstation.com/News/PressReleases/449 Official US Prologue Release]</ref>

It includes functioning speedometers and odometers, reflecting rear-view mirrors, wing mirrors and real time in-car lighting effects (cast shadows).

Back view is also specific with the in-car view.

Spec II update brings Drift Mode (similar to that of ''Gran Turismo HD Concept''), car tuning adjustments, and head to head two-player racing offline.<ref>[http://www.gran-turismo.com/en/gt5p/news/d2024.html "“Spec II” Update Information"]</ref>

====Autumn 2008 (planned)====
On April 4 the series creator, Kazunori Yamauchi, declared "''There are still a lot of things we have left un-done in GT5 Prologue, so by fall this year there will be another major update to the game''".<ref>[http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=186087 "Kazunori Yamauchi Interview"]</ref> 

Earlier on March 18 2008, the North American version producer, Taku Imasaki, already announced planned updates involving online community features would be available after April 17.<ref>[http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/03/17/ferrari-f2007-gt5-prologues-god-mode/comment-page-1/#comment-49522  "private races with buddies and in-game chat are all in the works… but will not be ready from day one. Will keep you posted on the progress!"]</ref> This was later confirmed by Yamauchi himself "''The major things that we're planning for the update will be to add community building features such as communication between players.''"<ref>[http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=186087 "Kazunori Yamauchi Interview"]</ref>

During a press event in London on April 4, Martin Robinson from IGN has reported in an interview with Kazunori Yamauchi that vehicle deformation (damage modelling) will be added to Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Spec II through a future update. "''Maybe by Fall'' [2008] ''we'll be able to implement it''"<ref>[http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/864/864502p1.html "Kazunori Yamauchi Q&A"]</ref><ref>[http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/864/864142p1.html "Vehicle deformation could arrive as soon as Autumn says Yamauchi."]</ref> Yamauchi mentioned.

The same day Yamauchi explained to CVG's Mike Jackson that "''in terms of quality and features of the game, and in terms of functionality, GT5 Prologue will ultimately reach an equivalent level to GT5. I think the major difference between Prologue and GT5 will be the number of cars and courses that will be included within the game, in that there will be many more''."<ref>[http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=186087 "Kazunori Yamauchi Interview"]</ref>

During an interview with IGN on July 17, 2008, when asked about the progress on the damage patch, Yamauchi answered, "''Our plans haven't changed, and we're working on it. But this is Gran Turismo, so it might be a little bit late.''" This suggests that the update could miss its Autumn release date.<ref>[http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/891/891903p1.html E3 2008: Gran Turismo Q&A]</ref>

===GT-TV===
The '''Gran Turismo TV''' feature was introduced in the free playable demo version. The VOD service was activated on October 22 2007 providing free SD trailers for three upcoming GT-TV programs,<ref>[http://www.gran-turismo.com/en/gt5p/news/d1327.html "“Gran Turismo TV” promotional videos added to Free Downloadable Demo"]</ref> Super GT ("Climax Digest"), D1 Grand Prix ("Top of the Drifting World") and Best Motoring ("Best Motoring Trailer").<ref>[http://www.gran-turismo.com/gt5p/ Gran Turismo 5 Prologue official website - TV]</ref><sup>[http://www.gran-turismo.com/en/gt5p/news/d1327.html]</sup>.

From October 22 to November 30 three GT-TV exclusive HD videos featuring game producer Kazunori Yamauchi premiered in the demo: "First Impression: Lancer Evolution X",<ref>[http://www.gran-turismo.com/en/gt5p/news/d1360.html Free Downloadable Demo - “First Impression Lancer Evolution X” program added]</ref> "Tokyo Motor Show 2007"<ref>[http://www.gran-turismo.com/en/gt5p/news/d1367.html Free Downloadable Demo – “Tokyo Motor Show 2007” program added]</ref> and "GT-R Legend Inside Story part I".<ref>[http://www.gran-turismo.com/en/gt5p/news/d1540.html New program: “THE GT-R Legend INSIDE STORY Part 1”]</ref>

The demo was removed from the Japanese PlayStation Store on November 30<ref>[http://www.gran-turismo.com/jp/gt5p/news/d1409.html "無料体験版　オンラインサービスの終了時期について"]</ref> and its online functions ended on December 6,<ref>[http://www.gran-turismo.com/jp/gt5p/news/d1409.html 無料体験版　オンラインサービスの終了時期について2007年11月05日]</ref> however all issued VOD videos were later re-released in the game's retail version through updates, except the SD trailers. "The GT-R Legend Inside Story" part 1 documentary was included in the Blu-Ray Disc though.<ref>[http://www.gran-turismo.com/jp/gt5p/news/d1518.html "『ＧＴ５プロローグ』商品概要とスケジュールのご案内"]</ref> It was later completed by parts II & III, both released through GT-TV updates.

'''Gran Turismo 5 Prologue''' on ennakkoversio tulevasta Gran Turismo 5-autopelistä ja se on viides osa suosittua Gran Turismo-pelisarjaa. Pelin on kehittänyt Polyphony Digital, joka on tehnyt myös kaikki aikaisemmat Gran Turismo-pelit. Peli on ilmestynyt yksinomaan PlayStation 3:lle. Prologue-versio on julkaistu myös sarjan aiemmista osista. Peli on ilmestynyt sekä Blu-Ray-levyllä, että ladattavana versiona.

== Pelattavuus ==
PlayStation 2:n ''Gran Turismo 4'':n autot koostuivat 4000 polygonista, mutta GT5 Prologuen autoissa käytetään peräti 200 000 polygonia. Määrää lisää merkittävästi se, että pelin uuden sisäkuvakulman vuoksi myös autojen sisustus on mallinnettu kokonaan. Tässä uudessa kuvakulmassa näkyvät mm. nopeusmittari, matkamittari, takapeili ja sivupeilit. Lisäksi autojen mallinnus osa osalta mahdollistaa sen, että erilaisia lisäosia voidaan tarjota myöhemmin päivityksillä.

Paljon kaivattu vaurionmallinnus on ensimmäistä kertaa sarjan historiassa tulossa tähän peliin. Yamauchi on vahvistanut, että vaurionmallinnus on tulossa peliin myöhemmin ladattavana lisäsisältönä, joten heti ostoversiossa siitä ei pääse nauttimaan. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että varsinaisessa ''Gran Turismo 5:ssä'' tulee olemaan vaurionmallinnus ja se on mukana luultavasti heti pelin ostoversiossa.

=== Valikot ===
Pelin alkuvalikon taustalla näkyy pelaajan sillä hetkellä käytössä oleva auto satunnaisessa maisemissa. Valikon alaosan seitsemästä ikonista Yksi vie kilpailuihin ja toinen autotalliin. TV-ikonin taakse voi ladata omia autoaiheisia videoitaan ja tästä pelisarjan luoja '''Kazunori Yamauchi''' lupasi kertoa lisää syyskuun Tokyo Game Showssa. Uusinnat-ikonin takaa löytyvät pelaajan tallennetut uusinnat.

=== Tekoäly ===
Pelin tekoälyä on paranneltu huomattavasti ja tällä kertaa kiskoilla ajavat vastustajat ovat historiaa. Vastustajat reagoivat pelaajan liikkeisiin ja saattavat esimerkiksi aggressiivisesti estää ohitusyrityksiä.
