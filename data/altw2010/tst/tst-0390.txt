'''''The Man of Steel''''' was a six-issue 1986 by DC Comics, several months after the twelve-issue limited series ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' completed. ''The Man of Steel'' was written and penciled by John Byrne and inked by Dick Giordano. 

==Overview==
The mini-series was designed to DC's universe as a whole. The pre-Crisis stories were drawn to a close in Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?".

From 2004 until 2007, this and ''DCU spanning event ''Infinite Crisis'', both this series' and the ''Birthright'' portrayals of Krypton and Superman's birth have been removed as the "official origin" in favor of a new origin story that has yet to be told.<ref>[http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/comics.php?topic=articles/continuity-postIC]</ref> A portion of the new origin appeared in ''Action Comics'' #850, which showed Kal-El being born moments before going into his ship and being sent to Earth.

''The Man of Steel'' was followed by three four-issue mini-series which retold the world of Superman, called ''The World of Krypton'' (December 1987 - March 1988), ''The World of Smallville'' (April - July 1988), and ''The World of Metropolis'' (August - November 1988), all of them written by Byrne.

==Story==

''The Man of Steel'' retells Superman’s story beginning with his origin. Each issue focuses on a different time in the early years of his career. In telling the story, Byrne drew from all available media to have depicted Superman for inspiration.

The series reboots Superman continuity for a modern audience. Previous depictions of the comic book Superman and his mythology are discarded. Some characters’ backgrounds were largely altered.

===Issue One===
The first issue chronicles the origin of Superman, from his flight from Krypton to his arrival on Earth where he is discovered by his adoptive parents, the Kents. The story fast forwards to a high school football game after which adoptive father Jonathan Kent takes the now-teenaged Clark for a ride. By this time, Clark has developed most of, if not all, his powers as Superman. Jonathan reveals to Clark the truth that he (Clark) was never their biological son and that he was found from a crashed spaceship. The revelation causes Clark to decide to use his powers for the greater good. For the next few years during his studies in university, he has been saving lives and averting disasters in secret until an experimental space shuttle forces him to expose himself to the public. He meets Lois Lane for the first time and both felt a connection to each other but before they could react to it, a mob surrounds them. Clark is unable to deal with the sudden attention. In order to preserve Clark’s secret identity, Jonathan comes up with the idea of a superhero identity. Clark adopts a costume and the name he was given in the news, Superman.

* The planet Krypton was a cold and emotionally sterile planet, an idea Byrne borrowed from the 1978 Superman.
* Kal-El was not an infant sent from Krypton to Earth; rather, his fetus was placed in a "birthing matrix" equipped with a rocket engine and Jor-El's experimental warp drive, with Kal-El gestating during the trip to Earth; once the rocket landed, Kal-El was fully "born" on Earth. This also made him "born" an American, a plot point that would be used in Armageddon 2001, a DC Comics storyline which explored possible futures, one of which featured Superman becoming President of the United States.
*Clark's abilities developed gradually in the yellow sun environment, starting with resistance to injury, then strength, x-ray vision, etc., with his ability to fly being the last to emerge. It took until his late teen years for all of his powers to develop; thus, Clark only adopted the Superman identity in adulthood, and never was Superboy.
*The Kents secretly adopted Clark and passed him off as their biological son. Prior to finding Clark, Martha Kent had a history of failed pregnancies. Friends and relatives assumed that they kept Martha’s “pregnancy” a secret in fear of losing another child. A blizzard that closed off Smallville also helped in the Kents’ alibi. In some pre-''Crisis'' depictions, the Kents surrendered baby Smallville'' all involve the same circumstances and cover-up of Clark's adoption. Although in Smallville the problems raised and the cover up of his adoption were taken in a much more serious and realistic manner. 
*Clark mentions that he has been making Metropolis his base of operations for about three years. 
*While the pre-''Crisis'' Superman's costume was invulnerable (as a result of being made from the blankets in the rocket that brought him to Earth), the post-''Crisis'' Superman's costume was made of ordinary material. But while the cape often became ripped and torn (or even completely destroyed on occasion) for dramatic effect, the rest of the costume was usually left untouched. It was later explained that the post-''Crisis'' Superman's body generated an invisible "aura" that surrounded him and contributed to his invulnerability. Objects held close to him, such as his costume, were protected from harm; his cape, meanwhile, could easily sustain damage in battle. The Superman S-shield is an original design by Clark and Jonathan.
*Byrne made some adjustments to Superman's costume. While keeping every classic element, he significantly increased the size of the S-shield so that it almost entirely covered the chest. The cape is also made larger and longer, its flowing in the air made to look more dramatic.
* At the end of the issue, Clark/Superman is about 24/25, as shown below, the rest of the story takes over four years, which ends with him at 28/29, depending on which month it ends. The advancement in pacing is because although a reboot of continuity, Superman comic books still had to keep continuity with other books that DC published, for example Batman or Justice League, thus the origin story is spread out so the regular book would not conlfict with other publications in continuity terms.

===Issue Two===
Daily Planet editor-in-chief Perry White assigns Lois Lane to get an interview with Superman. Meanwhile, Superman is all over Metropolis rescuing citizens and foiling bank robberies. After a series of failed attempts to interview Superman, Lois decides to take a gamble and plunges her car into the harbor. Superman arrives and takes her home. She finally has the scoop on Superman only to find out she was beaten to the headline by the new reporter, Clark Kent.

*Superman'' and Superman: The Animated Series).
*Lane was also given a reddish-brown head of hair instead of black with blue being used as a non local color to indicate details.
*The Mr. L in the limousine who wished to talk with Lois is none other than Lex Luthor.

===Issue Three===
<!-- Deleted image removed: left|thumb -->
Superman and Batman meet each other for the first time. Batman is on the trail of the criminal known as Magpie. He is interrupted in a lead by Superman who regards him as an outlaw. Rather than risk capture, Batman informs Superman that should the latter make any attempts to come near him, a signal will be activated that will trigger a bomb and kill a person somewhere in the city. The two are forced to work together and eventually capture Magpie. In the end, Batman reveals to Superman that the endangered person is Batman himself. Superman departs cautioning Batman against crossing any further lines. Batman admits to himself of a respect for Superman’s innate goodness and wonders if, in a different reality, they could have been friends.

*Superman's relationship with Batman, which was friendly pre-''Crisis'' became much more tentative, as each disagreed with the other's methods and attitudes. An allusion is made to their pre-''Crisis'' friendship with Batman’s pondering at the end of the story.
*Batman mentions that he had read Superman's debut in the Daily Planet news reports eight months ago.

===Issue Four===
Lois and Clark are guests at a party to be held on Luthor’s luxury liner. Upon arriving, they are entertained by Luthor in his private chamber on the ship. When Luthor insinuates his desire of Lois, the latter is offended having some knowledge of Luthor’s past. Lois refuses to be one of Luthor’s trophy wives and decides to leave the ship. She and Clark are then confronted by South American terrorists who promptly throw Clark overboard. As the terrorists are trying to cordon the hostages, Clark changes to Superman and lifts the liner ship which surprises everyone on board. This opens an opportunity for Lois to seize control and knock out the terrorists. Luthor then reveals that he allowed the terrorists to get on board just so that he could coax Superman to come and include him on his payroll. Superman refuses Luthor’s offer and is deputized by the mayor of Metropolis to arrest Luthor. A few days later, Luthor confronts Superman and warns him of a day of reckoning.

*Superman's arch-nemesis Lex Luthor was no longer a mad scientist but instead a power-hungry billionaire, "the most powerful man in Metropolis," who resented Superman's overshadowing presence.  Instead of battling Superman directly, Lex would use hired minions and staff on his payroll or manipulate others to confront Superman, while employing various methods (bribery, plausible deniability, legal trickery, etc.) to ensure that none of the incidents could be conclusively linked to him.
*Clark mentions that it has been almost eighteen months since he beat Lois on the scoop on Superman.

===Issue Five===
The story begins with Superman confronting Luthor after foiling another of the latter’s revenge schemes. However, Luthor is able to elude arrest when Superman is unable to tie the villain to his criminal act. Superman leaves but not before his body is scanned by Dr. Teng’s cloning machine. Due to Superman’s alien heritage, the machine is unable to duplicate his DNA as it can only recognize known lifeforms. At first the clone appears to be a perfect duplicate of Superman until it keels over unconscious and its body starts to crystallize. Frustrated, Luthor orders the body to be disposed of. Days later, the duplicate resurfaces thinking it is Superman and helping Metropolitans. The people, upon seeing it, flee in fear. It later meets a blind Lucy Lane, Lois’s sister, who attempted to commit suicide by jumping off a building. Superman encounters the creature and engages it in battle. The fight ends in a final blow, shattering the imperfect duplicate into a dust cloud which somehow restores Lucy’s sight.

*On the opening page of this issue, Superman is seemingly capturing Luthor, who is wearing his pre-''Crisis'' power suit.  However, the next page reveals that it is one of Luthor's pawns in the suit. Luthor claims that the suit had been stolen and that he had no knowledge of the plot to attack Superman. Unfortunately, the suit's systems have left the man inside a vegetable, unable to tell the truth of Luthor's involvement. The reader later learns that Luthor was responsible for all of the above, which Superman suspects. 
*The villain Bizarro was established as an imperfect clone of Superman, created from the superhero's DNA, rather than as a duplicate resulting from an imperfect duplicating ray. Furthermore, Bizarro is no longer an "imperfect opposite" of Superman and as such, has identical rather than opposite powers.  Though the duplicate is referred to as "bizarre" in-story, it is never explicitly named "Bizarro"; that name will not be established post-Crisis until years later, when another imperfect duplicate created by the same process runs rampant in Metropolis.
*Lois mentions that she has been dreaming of kissing Superman for three years now, indicating that he has been active in Metropolis at least that long at this point.
*The restoration of Lucy's sight is an element borrowed from Bizarro's original debut in Superboy #68, right down to the dust cloud; it is intimated that the duplicate deliberately sacrifices itself after hearing that Lucy's sight began to improve after contact with the creature.

===Issue Six===
Clark returns to Smallville after a long time away. His adoptive parents pick him up. Jonathan Kent was about to tell him something but Martha shushed him. Later that night, Clark could not sleep as he wonders what his Pa Kent was about to tell him. When he went for a midnight snack, a “ghost” of Jor-El surprises him and touches him. Superman discovers himself to be on an alien planet where he encounters his biological mother, Lara. As the hallucination wears off, he is face to face with his old flame, Lana Lang. In a flashback, it turns out that on the night that Clark learned his heritage he went to Lana and revealed the truth of his powers to her. She confesses her feelings to him. She realizes that Clark can no longer belong to her, that he belongs to the world and this fact had hurt her. She had gone through a period of depression and finally accepts the fact. The next day, Superman thinks about what she said and starts wondering about where he truly came from. He goes to the location where Jonathan hid the rocket ship he was found in only to find that the ship is gone. The hologram of Jor-El reappears and tells him to be silent and to learn. It appears that Superman is under some kind of psionic attack but the Kents arrive in time and break it off. Superman flies away, realizing that it was not a mental attack but a download of knowledge of everything about Krypton into his brain. He finally knows his true parents and where he came from and though he appreciates the knowledge he has been given, in the end, he embraces his humanity ever more.

*Superman was made the sole survivor of Krypton's destruction (vs. the earlier version having other survivors such as Supergirl, Krypto, etc. attached to him).
*Superman had no memory of his existence on Krypton, but he instead identified himself as a citizen of Earth.
*Pre-''Crisis'', Smallville.
*Clark's adoptive Terran parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent are alive and well in Clark's adulthood, and Clark visits them periodically. Pre-''Crisis'', they had died shortly after Clark's high school graduation.
*Clark is twenty-eight years old by the time the story ends.

'''Man of Steel''' (''The Man of Steel'') è una miniserie a fumetti di sei numeri pubblicati tra ottobre e dicembre 1986 con cadenza quindicinale dalla DC Comics, alcuni mesi dopo l'uscita di ''Crisi sulle Terre Infinite''.

La fumetti britannico ma attivo e residente negli Stati Uniti d'America. L'autore decise di avvalersi della collaborazione ai disegni dell'esperto Dick Giordano, che realizzò l'inchiostrazione di tutti i numeri dell'opera.

Nasce cosi la mini-serie ''Man of Steel'' (in italiano ''uomo d'acciaio'') nella quale Byrne - senza dimenticare il suo motto ''back to the basics!'' (''ritorno alle origini!'') riscrive la storia del celebre supereroe.

''Man of Steel'' è considerata un punto di riferimento della ''continuity'' di Superman e della DC Comics.

La serie è stata tradotta in Corto Maltese'' sul finire degli anni ottanta, poi riedita dalla casa editrice anni novanta prima sul mensile ''American Heroes'' e poi raccolta in un volume brossurato, omologo di quelli statunitensi.
Nel 2006 è stata ristampata in un volume edito da Oscar e nei primi due numeri della serie ''Le avventure di Superman'' edita da Planeta De Agostini.
==Trama==

=== Fuga da Krypton ===

Pianeta Krypton.
Gli abitanti del pianeta hanno raggiunto un grado di sviluppo sociale e scientifico tale da concepire i figli senza rapporti sessuali, bensì in provetta.

Kal-El, scopre che una reazione atomica dentro il nucleo del pianeta droidi servitori di rimuovere la camera di gestazione che contiente il feto di Kal-El dalla matrice.

La moglie Lara non comprende il comportamento di Jor-El. Ma oramai il tempo scarseggia, poiché il pianeta è vicino alla fine, ed il razzo con iper-guida contenente la camera di gestazione di Kal-El, viene lanciato verso la Terra, pianeta che Jor-El ha scelto per la salvezza del figlio, poiché i kryptoniani, se esposti ai raggi del suo sole giallo, sviluppano poteri inimmaginabili.

Il pianeta Krypton esplode violentemente. Prima che il razzo entri nell'iperspazio, un singolo pezzo di ''kryptonite'', le cui radiazioni sono letali per chi è originario di Krypton, si attacca alla navicella che sparisce in lampo di luce, in rotta verso la Terra.

=== L'uomo d'acciaio cresce sulla terra ===

Smallville, nel Kansas, vince praticamente da solo una partita di football americano della squadra locale, di cui è la stella.

Le ragazze e gli amici fanno il tifo per Clark, l'asso del football di Smallville, ma l' agricoltore Jonathan Kent, il padre adottivo di Clark, non sembra entusiasta.

A fine partita Jonathan Kent porta il giovane Clark in un campo di sua proprietà e gli mostra il razzo spaziale nel quale, anni addietro, lui e sua moglie ''Martha'', trovarono il piccolo Clark, praticamente un neonato.
