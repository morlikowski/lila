'''Marija Anžuvinska''' (1370 - 17. maj 1395) bila je ugarska i hrvatska kraljica od 1382 do 1395. godine.

Bila je najstarija preživjela kćer Ludovika I, kralja Ugarske i Poljske. Majka joj je bila Stjepana II. Dvije starije Marijine sestre, Elizabeta i Katarina, umrle su kao djevojčice. Ludovik je aranžirao brakove za svoje dvije preživjele kćerke, Mariju i Jadvigu, pa je Marija zaručena za Žigmunda Luksemburškog. Brakovi ipak nisu sklopljeni tokom Ludovikova života.

Kako Ludovik I nije imao muških nasljednika, očekivalo se da će nakon njegove smrti Marija, njegova najstarija kćerka i nasljednica po primogenituri, naslijediti oba njegova kraljevstva. Međutim, Poljaci su bili nezadovoljni personalnom unijom sa Ugarskom (nastalom 1370. godine za vrijeme vladavine Marijina oca), te je stoga Marijina mlađa sestra Jadviga proglašena poljskom kraljicom (tačnije, kraljem). Uprkos brojnim pokušajima, Marija nikada nije uspjela podvrgnuti Poljsku svojoj vlasti.

'''Mary of Hungary''' (c. Bosnian ''Marija Anžuvinska'') was Queen of Hungary, Croatia, Rascia, etc. from 1382 until her death in 1395. 

== Childhood ==

She was the third of four, but the eldest surviving daughter of Louis I ''the Great'' of Hungary and his second wife Elizabeth of Bosnia.

She was intended to inherit both of her father's kingdoms, Hungary and hereditary kingdom of Poland.

Her father king Louis had arranged marriages for her and her younger sister Jadwiga. Ultimately Queen Jadwiga of Poland, William married Mary's relative Joan II of Naples instead, and Jadwiga became married to Jogaila of Lithuania.

== Reign ==

Mary became Queen Elisabeth, Elizabeta Charles of Durazzo, King of Naples to become briefly the King of Hungary in 1385. Queen Elizabeth and Garai had Charles II assassinated in 1386. Charles's heir was his underage son Ladislas of Naples (d. 1414) who attempted all his life to conquer Hungary, but despite some support in the country, did not succeed.

Magnates of Lesser Poland had been deeply unsatisfied with 82) with Hungary, and despite of decreed succession order, chose the nine-year-old Jadwiga as the Queen of Poland in 1384. After a couple of years, Jadwiga was compelled to leave Hungary for Poland. Mary and her guardians never managed in governing nor obtaining Poland. 66) annexed by Poland, however was taken by Hungary, and only after several years, Poland recovered it.

===Capture and rescue===
Elisabeth and Mary were captured in 1386 by the powerful Horvat brothers, Paul Bishop of Machva and Ladislaus, but probably on the orders of Mary's smart but wicked seventeen-year-old husband and King-consort Sigismund.  

On the first anniversary of the death of Charles II, January 1387, Elizabeth was strangled before Mary's eyes. Mary bitterly accused her husband, King-consort Sigismund for arranging the kidnapping and murder of her mother Elisabeth. Mary did not want to live with Sigismund, due to the matricide of his Mother-in-Law, therefore keeping a separate household. She accused Sigismund of squandering her patrimony on ''cheap women'', and ''short-sighted politics''. She reconciled with the Horvats and granted them estates in Slavonia and Northern Bosnia.

In July 1387 Mary was rescued from captivity by troops of Bosnian faction.
