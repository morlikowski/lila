== News and recap ==
The most memorable event of the night was when Stan Berman, a New York City cabdriver, awarded Bob Hope a homemade Oscar after he had slipped through security and made his way to the stage.<ref></ref> Among the many dresses worn that night, Joan Crawford wore a spaghetti strap gown with jewels she had worn at an earlier appearance at the Oscars.<ref></ref> Shirley Jones wore a strapless gown covered by ornate fabric.<ref></ref> Shirley Knight's gown used a sheer overlay to create the illusion of two layers of fabric. <ref></ref> Debbie Reynolds's black and white gown was inspired by an envelope.<ref></ref>

== Notable quotes ==
*"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm the world's greatest gatecrasher, and I just came here to present Bob Hope with his 1938 trophy." -- Stan Berman, a Brooklyn cabdriver.
*"We'll give it to him." -- Shelley Winters, in response to Berman. She had been onstage awarding the Academy Award for Best Cinematography with Vince Edwards.
