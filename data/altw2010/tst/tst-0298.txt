'''''The World Needs A Hero''''' is an album by heavy metal roots, after the commercial rock style of their previous releases, ''Risk''.  However, it still retained a bit of the commercial feel from previous albums, as Mustaine claims the album was like "a ship lost at sea trying to return to its course".

"Return to Hangar" is a sequel to the song "Hangar 18", which was found on the ''Rust in Peace'' album. 

Mustaine also dedicated the song "When" to all the nay-sayers on Megadeth's internet message board who spoke ill of him and the band after their recent attempts at commercial success (or, a "big fuck you to all the wishy-washy fans out there".) The song's intro riff is the same as a riff found in Diamond Head, which Mustaine has said was intentional, as an homage to Diamond Head and the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal movement<ref>[http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/lyrics_world.html#When The Realms of Deth - Megadeth Lyrics - The World Needs a Hero<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. 

Edited versions of the album put a black bar over the innards of Dave Mustaine which Vic Rattlehead is seen emerging from to edit the violence.
