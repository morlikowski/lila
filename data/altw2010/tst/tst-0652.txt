'''Glenn Hoddle''' (born Hayes, English football manager and former footballer who played as a attacking midfielder for Tottenham Hotspur, AS Monaco, Chelsea and Swindon Town and at international level for England. 

In 2007 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame which cited him as the most gifted English footballer of his generation exhibiting "sublime balance and close control, unrivalled passing and vision and extraordinary shooting ability, both from open play and set pieces".<ref>[http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/pages/fame/Inductees/glennhoddle.htm Glenn Hoddle's induction into Hall of Fame in 2007] - National Football Museum Retrieved April 06 2008</ref>

He has had spells as manager of Swindon Town (earning promotion to the Chelsea (taking them to the FA Cup final), Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur (reaching a League Cup final) and most recently Wolverhampton Wanderers.  

As manager, he took England to the World Cup second round in 1998 only to lose to Argentina on penalties. Hoddle was dismissed as manager of the national team after he suggested that disabled people were being punished for sins in a previous life.

==Playing career==
===Tottenham Hotspur===
Hoddle joined the club as a schoolboy apprentice in April 1974 following the recommendation of another Tottenham legend, Norwich City in August 1975. Spurs drew 2&ndash;2. Hoddle was forced to wait until February 1976 to start a First Division match and immediately announced his arrival with a spectacular strike past Stoke City and England goalkeeper Peter Shilton.

The talented playmaker flourished under the management of Second Division in 1976&ndash;77 after 27 seasons of First Division football, a Hoddle inspired Spurs side won promotion to the top flight at the first attempt. As Tottenham's transitional phase continued, Hoddle's enigmatic and often controversial international career began in December 1976 against Wales in an Under-21 fixture. He would collect another seven caps at that level and play twice for the England 'B' team prior to scoring on his full international debut against Bulgaria in November 1979.

The 1979&ndash;80 campaign heralded the emergence of Hoddle as a top-class player, the 22-year-old midfielder scored 19 goals in 41 league appearances and was deservedly awarded the PFA Young Player of the Year award at the end of the season. Hoddle's attacking skills, utilised both in the center of midfield and on the wing, were simply breathtaking and often at odds with the ingrained British football philosophy of tireless running and a strong work ethic. His sublime balance and close control, unrivalled passing and vision and extraordinary shooting ability, both from open play and set pieces, made Hoddle the most gifted English player of his generation.        

In 1981, he starred as Spurs won the League Cup, losing 3&ndash;1 to Liverpool, and the semi-final stage of the Kuwait after a substitute appearance in a 2&ndash;0 victory over Czechoslovakia.          

Hoddle's involvement in the following three seasons was limited by a number of niggling injury problems (he started only 76 of a possible 126 league matches) but nevertheless, Hoddle proved to be the architect behind the team's 1984 UEFA Cup triumph despite missing the Final due to fitness concerns. In October 1983, he dazzled the White Hart Lane crowd with a phenomenal second-round display as Spurs won 6&ndash;2 on aggregate against a Feyenoord Rotterdam side containing the legendary Johan Cruyff. Such was the quality of his performance in both matches, the Dutch legend entered the Tottenham dressing room and offered Hoddle his shirt as a sign of respect.  

Spurs came close to further honours in the next three seasons, reaching third place in the First Division and the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup in 1984-85 and another FA Cup Final in 1987, losing 3&ndash;2 to , the only time the North London club has experienced defeat in the final of the famous knock-out competition. The unexpected loss to the Midlands side was Hoddle's last match for Spurs as newly-appointed AS Monaco manager Arsene Wenger brought him to the principality for a fee of £750,000. Between 1975 and 1987, the gifted playmaker scored 110 goals in 490 first-team matches in all competitions, only four players (Steve Perryman, Pat Jennings, Gary Mabbutt and Cyril Knowles) have made more appearances in a Spurs shirt. At international level, Hoddle won 44 caps for England during his Tottenham career, an inadequate return for such a skilful and charismatic footballer.

In 1987, Hoddle also found himself in the pop charts, with the single ''Diamond Lights'' making the UK Top 20 in a duet with Spurs and England team-mate Chris Waddle.

===AS Monaco===
Hoddle announced in 1987 that he would be leaving Tottenham Hotspur at the end of the season to pursue a career overseas where his style of play would be appreciated by continental managers and supporters. He joined AS Monaco alongside George Weah and fellow Englishman Mark Hateley and immediately inspired the club to the 1988 Ligue 1 championship, its first league title in six seasons. Hoddle was voted the Best Foreign Player in French football and would guide the team to the quarter-finals of the European Cup in the 1988&ndash;89 campaign. Arsene Wenger was the coach who brought him to Monaco and ironically Hoddle would go on to face his former manager in the heated North London Derby as manager of Tottenham Hotspur. Sadly, a severe knee injury curtailed his career at the highest level and in December 1990, the 33-year-old left the club by mutual consent having helped to improve the standing of English footballers in foreign countries. 

During his three and a half year spell in France, Hoddle represented England nine times, making his international farewell against the Soviet Union in June 1988. He returned to England and signed for Chelsea on a non-contract basis, leaving Stamford Bridge in March 1991 without playing a senior match to assume his first managerial post as player-manager of Swindon Town.

===England international career===
Though regarded as a genius with the ball at his feet, Hoddle was considered an enigmatic and unreliable player to international managers guilty of over-emphasising hard work and physical prowess instead of technical ability and attacking creativity. He was included in the 1982 and 1986 second goal in England's 2&ndash;1 defeat. Hoddle also featured prominently in the European Championship squads of 1980 and 1988, making his 53rd and final international appearance during the latter tournament.

Hoddle's talent is widely appreciated abroad; less so in England. Arsene Wenger, who worked with him at Monaco, recalled: 'His control was superb and he had perfect body balance. His skill in both feet was uncanny... I couldn't understand why he hadn't been appreciated in England. Perhaps he was a star in the wrong period, years ahead of his time.' 

Michel Platini famously attacked the English for neglecting creativity; had Hoddle been born French, he said, 'he would have won 150 caps'. As Jean-Luc Ettori, Monaco's club captain at the time, put it: 'For us Glenn was ''le bon dieu'' - he was a god. There's nothing else to say.'

==Managerial career==
===Swindon Town===
Hoddle arrived at a troubled club with The Robins badly affected by a financial scandal which had seen them stripped of promotion to the First Division at the end of the 1989&ndash;90 season, a controversy which had negatively impacted the team's league form. Hoddle prevented Swindon from slipping into the Third Division and further improvement throughout the 1991&ndash;92 season saw the Wembley, and were then promoted to the Chelsea and was succeeded at Swindon by his assistant and former Spurs team-mate John Gorman.

===Chelsea===
In June 1993, Hoddle became player-manager of Chelsea (he retired from the playing side in 1995). His assistant at Chelsea was the former Tottenham manager FA Cup final in Hoddle's first season, where they lost 4&ndash;0 to Manchester United. But United had done the double, and consolation for their failure to win the trophy came in the form of a 1994&ndash;95 and lost by a single goal to Arsenal in the final. Hoddle guided Chelsea to the 1995&ndash;96, but was unable to take them beyond 11th place in the Premiership &ndash; they had occupied this final position three times in four years. He did establish them as a force in cup competitions and made them capable of attracting top-class players &ndash; such as Ruud Gullit &ndash; to the club.<ref>{{Cite news

===England===
Hoddle's three-year reign at Chelsea came to an end in 1996 when he accepted the England manager's job. He guided England to qualification for the 1998 World Cup, securing the team's entry with a memorable 0&ndash;0 draw in Italy. However, he caused controversy by omitting faith healer Eileen Drewery as part of the England coaching staff, which led to the team being dubbed "The Hod Squad".<ref>[http://www.4thegame.com/club/wfc/news/25185/PERRY+TIPPED+TO+JOIN+THE+HOD+SQUAD.html Perry Tipped To Join The Hod Squad :<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> They reached the Second Round of the 1998 tournament, losing on penalties to Argentina in a game noted for the ignominious sending off of Euro 2000 qualifying campaign. Hoddle's time in charge of the national team was, sometime later, praised by Harry Redknapp who believed him to have been the "perfect man for the job".<ref>''Dickinson, M [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=495651&in_page_id=1779 "Pompey boss Redknapp: I'd love England job but I can't see it coming my way"], Daily Mail, 22 November 2007 (retrieved 16 December 2007)''</ref>

===Southampton===
Hoddle was back in football within a year as Southampton manager, succeeding Dave Jones, who had been suspended in order to concentrate on clearing his name in connection with child abuse charges. Although these charges were later found to be false, Jones was not re-instated and Hoddle continued to be manager. Hoddle kept the Saints in the Premier League against all odds but left acrimoniously in March 2001 to return to Tottenham as manager.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Tottenham's league record in the decade leading up to Hoddle's appointment was disappointing. Hoddle was determined to establish them as a top playing side, and during his first season he had some wonderful opportunities to succeed. Tottenham reached the League Cup final but lost 2&ndash;1 to Blackburn Rovers. The club's promising early season form dwindled away into mediocrity and they finished ninth in the Premiership, an improvement on the previous season's 11th place but hardly impressive. Spurs began the 2002&ndash;03 season in fine form and Hoddle was named Premiership Manager of the Month for August 2002 after they ended the month top of the league. Although few people expected them to stay there, 10th place in the final table was still disappointing. The pressure began to build up on Hoddle and he was sacked in September 2003 after a poor start to the season, in which the team picked up just four points from their opening six league games and lay in the Premiership drop zone. Ironically, his final game in charge was a 3&ndash;1 loss to old side Southampton.

'''Glenn Hoddle''' (* Hayes, Middlesex) ist ein englischer Fußballtrainer und ehemaliger Fußballspieler.

Hoddle begann seine Fußballerkarriere in der Jugendmannschaft der Tottenham Hotspurs. Sein Ligadebüt gab er 1975 als Siebzehnjähriger bei Tottenham. Der technisch hochbegabte Hoddle entwickelte sich schnell zur spielbestimmenden Figur im Spiel der Spurs. 1979 wurde er zwangsläufig Nationalspieler und nahm an der Fußball-Europameisterschaft 1980 in Italien teil. 1981 und 1982 gewann er den FA Cup und kam mit der Nationalmannschaft in die zweite Finalrunde der Fußball-Weltmeisterschaft 1982 in Spanien. 1984 gewann er den UEFA-Pokal. Bei der Fußball-Weltmeisterschaft 1986 in Mexiko war er neben Torjäger Gary Lineker Garant für den Einzug ins Viertelfinale.

Argentinien aus, machte jedoch bei diesem Turnier Spieler wie Michael Owen und David Beckham zu neuen Superstars.

1999 führten negative Äußerungen Hoddles über behinderte Menschen zu einem landesweiten Skandal, der schließlich zur Entlassung Hoddles als Nationaltrainer führte. Nach einer kurzen Unterbrechung seiner Laufbahn kehrte er 2000 beim FC Southampton auf die Trainerbank zurück. Als er jedoch ein Trainerangebot seines Lieblingsvereins Tottenham Hotspurs bekam, verließ er Southampton noch im gleichen Jahr. Bei den Spurs wurde er 2003 aufgrund von Erfolglosigkeit entlassen. Seit 2004 ist er Trainer bei den Wolverhampton Wanderers und hat einen Vertrag bis 2006.
