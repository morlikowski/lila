'''Kim Thayil''' (born Seattle-based grunge band Soundgarden, which he founded with Chris Cornell and Hiro Yamamoto in 1984. He was named 100<sup>th</sup> best guitarist of all time by ''Rolling Stone Magazine''.

==Early life==
Although he was born in Seattle in 1960, Thayil grew up in the Chicago suburb of Park Forest. Thayil's parents are from the south Indian state of Kerala.

Thayil met Hiro Yamamoto at Rich East High School in Park Forest. After graduation, they moved to Washington, where Thayil studied philosophy at the University of Washington. There they met Chris Cornell, a roommate, and the three formed Soundgarden in 1984.  

==Soundgarden (1984-1997)==
Soundgarden became the first of Seattle's grunge bands to sign with a major label (A&M Records).  They went on to release five albums, including three which went platinum at least once, and win two Grammys.  

Thayil became acclaimed for his guitar work, which was typically characterized by heavy riffing, and was cited among other grunge guitarists as an influence and a pioneer of the "Seattle Sound."  In 1994, Thayil commented, "I think Soundgarden is a pretty good band and I'm a fine guitarist. I'm not God, but I'm certainly not average. I feel very comfortable with the fact that not many other people can do what I do on guitar. I think my guitar is happy with the way I play it." 

While living in Seattle, he was known to associate with Rob Morgan of the Seattle band The Squirrels. He was also known to frequent The Cold Mountain Juice Company, a fresh juice company which was located in Seattle. A UPS Store now stands where The Cold Mountain Juice Company once was.

During the recording sessions for Soundgarden's final album, ''Down on the Upside'', Thayil clashed with Cornell over the vocalist's desire to shift away from Soundgarden's traditional heavy riffing. In the midst of these tensions, which increased on the subsequent tour and came to climax at a show in Hawaii (where Ben Shepherd flung his bass into the air in frustration after suffering from several technical failures), Soundgarden announced that it was disbanding in April 1997.

Originally one of Soundgarden's main songwriters, Thayil's contributions as a writer eventually dwindled to just one song on ''Down on the Upside'', "Never the Machine Forever."  While a member of Soundgarden, he wrote the following songs for the band: 

* "Hunted Down" (''Screaming Life'') ''... music''
* "Nothing to Say" (''Screaming Life'') ''... music''
* "Tears To Forget" (''Screaming Life'') ''... music (co-written)''

==After Soundgarden (1997-present)==
After the demise of Soundgarden, Thayil went on to contribute guitar to work by Presidents of the United States of America.  More recently, he contributed guitar to the track "Blood Swamp" from the 2006 Boris album Altar, for which he also wrote liner notes.

In 1999, Thayil formed a punk band, the Nirvana, at the time a member of protest activity against the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999, which was held on November 30, 1999. Originally scheduled to play at the Showbox on that same evening, police prevented the band from doing so, forcing the show to be rescheduled for the following night. This was Thayil's first live concert since the breakup of Soundgarden. The show was recorded and mixed by Soundgarden producer Jack Endino; it was released as the album ''Live from the Battle in Seattle'' in May 2000.

In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine named Thayil #100 on the list of the "100 greatest guitarists of all time".<ref>Fricke, David; Edmonds, Ben; Eliscu, Jenny;  Kemp, Rob; Kot, Greg; Levy, Joe; Moon, Tom; Puterbaugh, Parke; Randall, Mac; Sheffield, Rob (18 September 2003) "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" ''Rolling Stone''  Issue 931, pp. 46-61.

In 2004, Thayil played guitar for Probot, Dave Grohl's heavy metal side-project; he was featured  on the songs "Ice Cold Man" and "Sweet Dreams."
