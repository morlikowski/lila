'''יהדות ארמניה''' היא אחת מהקהילות היהודיות באזור הקווקז השוכנת באזור ארמניה של היום.

ישנן עדויות לישיבת יהודים באזור ארמניה כבר מהמאה ה-1 לפנה"ס והם באו לשם או בגלות בבל או עם חורבן בית ראשון וישבו שם כאשר ארמניה הייתה חלק מהאימפריה הפרסית.

מאז כיבוש ארמניה על ידי האימפריה המונגולית אין עדויות רבות לחיי יהודים בארמניה. עם זאת לפני מספר שנים נתגלה בית קברות יהודי בקרבת העיר ירוואן, בירת ארמניה. בבית הקברות  נקברו יהודים שנרצחו בטבח שעשו הסלג'וקים בתושבי הרובע היהודי בעיר במהלך המאה ה-13 ותחילת המאה ה-14.

העדויות הבאות לקיום יהודים בארמניה הם רק מהמאה ה-19 וכן מהמאה ה-20.

The '''Jews in Pagan Armenia''' were Gregor Lusavoric's coming. Armenian historians, as Moses Khorenatsi, hold that Tigranes II deported Jews from Palestine to Armenia. Tigranes invaded Syria, and probably northern Palestine as well. <ref>The Arabs in Antiquity: Their History from the Assyrians to the Umayyads - Page 347 by Jan Retsoe</ref> The Persians also deported thousands of Jewish families from Armenia, and resettled them at Isfahan.

==Armenian SSR==
After Eastern Armenia came under Russian rule in the early Ashkenazic and Mizrahi communities in Soviet republic finding more tolerance in the area than in Russia or Ukraine. After World War II, the Jewish population rose to approximately 5,000. However, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union many have left due to inadequate services and today the country's Jewish population has shrunk to 750. Despite small numbers, a high intermarriage rate, and relative isolation, a great deal of enthusiasm exists to help the community meet its needs.<ref name="arm-jews" />

==Present day==
There are many noteworthy Armenians with full or partial Jewish ancestry including World Chess Champion from 1985 to 1991, short-story writer Sergei Dovlatov, and Yelena Bonner, a human rights activist in the former Soviet Union.

There is a tiny community of Subbotnik Jews, whose ancestors converted to Judaism, and are quickly dwindling.<ref>[http://www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/090806JTA_Armenia.shtml Advocates on Behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States, and Eurasia: Small community in Armenia strives to preserve its heritage]</ref>

==Antisemitism in Armenia==
Although the contemporary relations between Israel and Armenia are normally good, some anti-Jewish sentiments are still present.

In April 1998, Igor Muradyan, a famous Armenian political analyst and economist, published an anti-semitic article in one of Armenia's leading newspapers ''Voice of Armenia''. Muradyan claimed that the history of Armenian-Jewish relations has been filled with "Aryans vs. Semites" conflict manifestations. He accused Jews of inciting ethnic conflicts, including the dispute over Nagorno-Karabagh and demonstrated concern for Armenia's safety in light of Israel's good relations with Turkey.<ref name="southcaucasus">[http://www.fsumonitor.com/stories/082599caucasus.shtml Union of Council for Soviet Jews: Antisemitism in Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia]</ref>

In that book, Jews (along with Turks) are identified as number-one enemies of Armenians and are described as "the nation-destroyer with a mission of destruction and decomposition." A section in the book entitled ''The Greatest Falsification of the 20th Century'' denies the Holocaust, claiming that it is a myth created by Zionists to discredit "Aryans": ''"The greatest falsification in human history is the myth of Holocaust.'' <...> ''no one was killed in gas chambers. There were no gas chambers."''<ref>[http://www.fsumonitor.com/stories/022002Armen.shtml Antisemitic Book Presented in Armenia; Jewish Leader Heckled].

The event was marked with public accusations that Jews were responsible for the Armenian Genocide.
