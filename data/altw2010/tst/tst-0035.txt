'''''War Front: Turning Point''''' is an PC. 

The game is set in an alternate World War II in which chancellor, Germany occupies Great Britain. Eventually, Nazi Germany is defeated, but this allows the Soviet Union to advance into Western Europe. The game features both real life and fictional "experimental" war machines and units. [http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=20248].

==Gameplay==
''War Front: Turning Point'' is a real-time strategy (RTS), that involves resource gathering and unit construction being the focus of gameplay along with unit combat. There is only one kind of resource that needs to be gathered for unit and building construction, simply entitled "Resource". Resource can be obtained however through varying means. Every faction has a collector Cargo Truck, which can be sent to gather resources from abandoned Ore Mines and Salvage Yards scattered throughout each map.<ref name="book1"></ref> Further resources can be gathered by capturing Oil Rigs and Banks with basic infantry after the ability has been researched. Resource is continuously generated rather than collected this way. Buildings for the Germans and Russians however need power in order to run and require construction of Power Plants in order to remain functional,<ref name="book1"/> similar to that of the Command and Conquer game series.

Units differ between factions, having an entirely unique selection although many being counter parts to units of other factions. Due to the game's premise of an alternate history, units include a mixture of real-life World War II weaponry such as Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter aircraft<ref></ref> and M4 Sherman<ref></ref> and T-34 tanks,<ref></ref> to real-life units that were not present during that war such as Northrop YB-49 jet bomber,<ref></ref> to entirely science fictional units like Exoskeleton mechs,<ref></ref> freeze rays<ref></ref> and shield generators,<ref></ref> while all can build a "Bridging" tank unit capable of building bridges over bodies of water.<ref></ref> Each faction can also build three heroes, individual characters with unique abilities, both passive and active to benefit the player's own units and against the foe's. The longer heroes and units remain on the battlefield, destroying units and buildings in the process, they can rank up increasing their abilities yet lose them if they are killed and re-built.<ref></ref> The player can also use aerial support such as calling in paratroopers reinforcements, scouting runs and bomb strikes.<ref name="book2"></ref>

''War Front: Turning Point'' however has an unconventional RTS feature, being the abilities to manually control pill boxes and turrets to fire upon enemies, like that of a first person shooter. The camera can also be ordered to follow other units in a third person perspective where order can still be given but the units not directly controlled like the turrets.<ref name="book2"/>

Along with the time of day changing dynamically in each game, random weather can affect effectiveness of units and interference. Storms for example can damage airplanes and radars (mini-map view) can become distorted or even temporarily knocked out.<ref name="book2"/>

==Factions==
===Allies===
Like the real World War II Western Allies, they are a coalition of the "earthquake bomb" via a Halifax bomber. The Allied experimental unit is the O.R.B. (Omni-Repulsor-Barrier), which is an APC truck with a force field generator on the back capable of protecting units within its deflector shield range from low to medium attacks.

===Germany===
The German forces are that of the real life Sonic tanks that use blasts of sonic waves rather than conventional ammunition and the Giant Zeppelin, which uses an aluminium structure and large air-to-ground cannons.

===Soviet Union===
The Soviets are less developed than the Allies and Germans, yet however use sheers numbers to overwhelm their opposition to their advantage. They have an expanded and more effective selection of infantry. Along with the general Giant Moving Turret that is slow with limited turret movement but has a long range and is very powerful and the APC Mole that can transport troops by tunnelling underground.

==Campaign==
===Premise===
''War Front: Turning Point'' is set in an alternate universe in which Britain. As a result, Germany, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union enter a technological cold war, resulting in various new advanced technologies on both sides.

===German Campaign===
The campaign opens with German invasion of Great Britain after 3 weeks where Oberstleutnant Roland Hellmann, under General Hardt takes control of London. While pushing back Allied resistance north, Hardt reveals to be working with the German Resistance, an under cover wing of the Wehrmacht under Dietrich Preiss, however Hellmann is uninterested in their means of conduct. He is then sent to rescue Elsa Adler, a female German Spy behind Soviet lines of the Eastern war front. There it is revealed that the Soviets are using weapons to cool the environment to their advantage, with Adler being pursued by Aleksei Mikhalkov of the Red Army. Upon Adler’s rescue, she reveals Soviet plans to build a range of new super weapons and conquer Germany. To prevent this, they join up entirely to Preiss’ resistance and with the help of American Colonel John Lynch, they press on to take out the current Nazi leaders in order to make peace and ally with Britain and the rest of the Western Allies in hope of suppressing further conflict with the Soviets. This operation is successful; despite Nazi attempts to even destroy Berlin in the process.

Back at Berlin, General Wells of Britain arrives to sign the peace treaty with Hardt, only to be interrupted by a surprise Soviet attack on the capital. While the Allies and Germans recover, it come apparent that the previous reports Adler obtained were fabricated by the Soviets themselves so the German Resistance would kill the Chancellor, thus bringing Germany into civil war at the Soviets benefit, having conquered all of Eastern Europe. The Soviets are held off momentarily, in order for Hellmann to locate and secure a top-secret German weapon’s base that houses plans for experiment weapons. During another push against the Soviets, Preiss however is captured and later used to lure both the Germans and Allies into a trap, yet eventually is rescued. 

As Hardt and Hellmann begin the assault on Moscow, Mikhalkov disguised as a German exoskeleton troop kidnaps Adler via false transmission. Hardt order the final strike against the Kremlin itself but stops just as the last remaining Soviets raise the white flag of surrender. Meanwhile Hellmann confronts Mikhalkov, firing on a transmission tower allowing it to destroy Mikhalkov’s suit. Instead of defeat Mikhalkov instead causes the remains to self-destruct yet Hellmann evades in time. Hardt and Lynch give their victory speeches and the final scene closes with Adler and Hellmann kissing.

==Characters==

While playing the game player will control and get to know nine characters (three for each side). Everyone of those characters plays important role in the story and has special skills that will help player in combat. Those heroes are "immortal" (If one of the heroes dies player can revive him/her at the barracks). Each of the characters has his/her own history and his/her own special abilities that they can use during combat. 

===Germany===
====Oberstleutnant Roland Hellmann====
Born 21 October 1912. Erfurt, Germany
Weapon: Triple Barreled Panzerfaust

He was probably the most controversial cadet at the Military Academy at his time, earning the best results in sports and achieving a flawless scholastic record, but also spending the most time in detention. It was obvious for everyone in the military that Hellmann would become one of the finest officers of the Wehrmacht... although with the small flaw of having a soft spot for women and good times and a tendency to show less discipline when it comes down to these two things.

Having grown up in the German country, it is not very unusual that a handsome and athletic young man like Roland developed a liking for the other sex and beer, but he was still regarded as sort of a misfit and was looked down upon by the other cadets who had different backgrounds. Since he was neither from noble nor wealthy descent and never joined the Hitlerjugend, they all thought of Hellmann as a low-born, and of lesser blood. Although, his athletic build, blonde hair and blue eyes portrayed the Nazi ideal.

Hellmann being as proud as he was, took up the challenge and did everything to prove that he is more worthy to wear the uniform than any of them. While learning everything the academy could teach him, he slowly backed away from the strict and ceremonious behavior of the typical Wehrmacht officer. He absolved the academy with outstanding honors, but felt that he still had much to learn. Being positioned under General Hardt's battalion, he knew it was the right place.

The general always kept a close eye on Hellmann, even in military school where he taught the young man at that time. He noticed that he and Hellmann are much in the same position, despite their different personalities, because they are both out of place characters among this new generation of Nazi officers. Hardt had a lot against the government but was clever enough to keep it to himself and a few selected fellow-officers only, who also preferred the pre-war Germany and its old ideals instead of the Nazi propaganda. Slowly they were forming a small resistance within the Wehrmacht, but it was Hellmann's appearance that gave Hardt the hope to make the first steps. Hardt found the new hero in him, the one the resistance and Germany needed.

Not only did Hardt become Hellmann's superior, he became his mentor as well. During the long years they spent together on the battlefield, they also became friends.

Now its up to Hardt to make his final move and start the rebellion against Nazism. Sooner or later Hellmann will have to choose sides between Germany and the Nazis.

====Dietrich Preiss====
Born June 1889. Karlsruhe, Germany. Life was not good to Preiss, even when he was a kid. He grew up in the Eichwald Institut, an orphanage infamous for its strict educational methods, where he learned a great deal of rigid discipline and endurance.

In the meantime, a dormant tendency for aggression began to awaken in him, which was yet to surface. When he was released from the orphanage years later to make his own path he had trouble finding his place in the world. History made the choice for everyone in his generation, and stacked the youth of Europe into the trenches of the bloody battlefields that became also the final resting place for most, but not for Preiss.

The war ended for him when he lost an eye during a bloody bayonet charge. Following his own ideals and knowing the true greatness of the old Germany, shortly before the outbreak of World War II he realized that the Nazis were driving the nation into a new war. Therefore he openly opposed the government. Preiss obviously underestimated the Nazis as they reacted to his outspoken criticism with harsh prosecution. He had to run for his life and go undercover, spent month hiding from the Gestapo, fleeing from city to city. To give old Germany a chance, he founded the German Resistance to fight against the Nazi terror by any means possible. Dietrich Preiss is a veteran hero of the German resistance. He is the master of the sabotage, trickery and reconnaissance operations.

====Elsa Adler====
Born May 1921. Dresden, Germany. Elsa grew up in an ordinary civilian family as the youngest, the fourth child, and the only girl after three boys. Her strict upbringing and the masculine environment didn't give much room for her to pursue any girly habits, so she grew up pretty much like her brothers to the great disappointment of her mother.

When the war broke out, her brothers were drafted into the German Wehrmacht. Just like in everything else, she wanted to do the same as they did and was dying to go and fight for the Reich, but of course this was impossible for a female in Germany. She tried to help her brothers as a patriot woman by working in factories and taking up civil service without having any real knowledge of the cause that she really served.

Her eyes were forced open by tragedies that changed her life forever. After just six months, all her brothers had been killed in action, on the front. She slowly realized what the Nazis were doing with her beloved country and to its people. Fueled by hate and anger as a lone freedom fighter, she started a lonely crusade against the Nazis.

When she eventually ran into a deadly trap set by the Gestapo, an unexpected rescuer, Dietrich Preiss, and his members of the newly forged German Resistance arrived and saved her from certain death. Realizing that all of them had a common goal, Elsa joined the Resistance and has served with them ever since. Elsa Adler is the heroine, a young, but talented spy of the German Resistance. She is quick, precise in operations, cautious and a real survivor.

'''War Front: Turning Point''' () — альтернативно-историческая Второй мировой войны. Игра была разработанна компанией Digital Reality и выпущенная в продажу компанией CDV 
Британией), Германией, и Советским Союзом с использованием супероружия.

== Сюжет ==

Действие игры происходит в параллельном мире, в котором нацистская Германия захватывает Великобританию. В результате, Германия и США вступают в технологическую холодную войну, что приводит к различным новым технологиям у обоих сторон. В конце концов, силы США и Британии выталкивают немцев из Великобритании и берут в плен канцлера (имя которого в игре не указывается), после чего Западную Европу вторгаются войска СССР, начиная новую фазу войны. Из-за большего колличества времени у всех сторон, каждая разработала различные новые формы оружия, раннее невиданные в истории.

== Фракции ==
=== Союзники ===
Самая технологическая сторона, чьи здания не требуют электрогенераторов чтобы функционировать. Их войска являются смесью британских единиц таких как танк «Матильда» и американских, таких как M26. У союзников есть преимущество в воздухе, так как бомбардировщик B-17 «Летающая крепость» и «бомбы землетрясения» с Handley Page Halifax.

Сверхоружием союзников является атомная бомба, сброшенная с Northrop YB-49ва.

=== Германия ===
Германия сосредоточена на огневой мощи своей техники, используя танк «Тигр» и Цепелин». Особые войска немцев включают в себя ракетчиков, солдатов с реактивными ранцами, а также пехоту с мехах. У немцев также есть хорошая противотанковая техника «Фердинанд». Германия может вызвать бомбардировщики Junkers Ju 390 и Horten Ho 229.

Сверхоружием Германии является баллистическую ракету «Фау-2».

=== СССР ===
Силы Союза имеют преимущество в численности. Советская пехота отличается от других, например некоторые солдаты могут бросать коктейли Молотова или продавать водку другим солдатам для повышения морального духа. Советские танки немного слабее других танков, то же самое касается и ВВС. Особыми единицами являются Гигантская Туррель, огромная САУ, и танк «Харьков», огромный танк с пятью башнями который можно уничтожить только массивными воздушными ударами. СССР может вызвать ТБ-3 для сброса бомб либо парашютистов.

Советское сверхоружие - «ледяная бомба», сброшенная с модифицированного ТБ-3 которая замораживает всё в определённом радиусе.

== Персонажи ==
Игрок управляет девятью основными персонажами (по три за сторону). Каждый из этих персонажей играет важную роль в сюжете и имеет различные способности чтобы помочь в бою. Эти герои «бессмертны», то есть при их смерти игрок может вернуть их в бой из казармы.

=== Германия ===
* Оберлейтенант Роланд Хелльманн
