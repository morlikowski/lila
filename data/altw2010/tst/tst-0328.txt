'''Cincinnati''' is a city in the Hamilton County. The municipality is located in southwestern Ohio and is situated on the Columbus and Cleveland, and the 56th largest city in the United States. Residents of Cincinnati are called Cincinnatians. 

Cincinnati is considered to have been the first major American boomtown rapidly expanding in the heart of the country in the early nineteenth century to rival the larger coastal cities in size and wealth. As the first major inland city in the country, it is sometimes thought of as the first purely American city, lacking the heavy European influence that was present on the east coast. However, by the end of the century, Cincinnati's growth had slowed considerably, and the city was surpassed in population by many other inland cities. 

Cincinnati is home to major sports teams including the NFL team), as well as events like the Cincinnati Masters (the oldest tennis tournament in the United States played in its original city)<ref name=same-city> </ref>,and the Thanksgiving day race (the second oldest race in the country-- after the Boston marathon).  The University of Cincinnati traces its foundation to the Medical College of Ohio, which was founded in 1819. <ref></ref>

Cincinnati is also known for having one of the larger collections of nineteenth-century German architecture in the U.S., primarily concentrated just north of Downtown, one of the largest historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
==History==

thumb|upright|left| From [[steamboats to baseball, Cincinnati history is both rich and diverse—as shown from a section of Great American Ball Park.]]

Cincinnati was founded in 1788 by John Cleves Symmes and Colonel Robert Patterson. <ref name="city-ws">{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/crc/pages/-5928-/|title=How Cincinnati Became A City
}}</ref> Surveyor The Adventures of Colonel Daniel Boone) named it "Losantiville" from four terms, each of a different language, meaning "the city opposite the mouth of the Licking River." "Ville" is French for "city," "anti" is Greek for "opposite," "os" is Latin for "mouth," and "L" was all that was included of "Licking River."

In 1790, Roman general who saved his city, then retired from power to his farm. To this day, Cincinnati in particular (and Ohio in general) is home to a disproportionately large number of descendants of Revolutionary War soldiers who were granted lands in the state.

In 1802, Cincinnati was chartered as a village and David Ziegler (1748-1811), a Revolutionary War veteran from Heidelberg, Germany, became the first mayor. Cincinnati was incorporated as a city in 1819. The introduction of steam navigation on the Ohio River in 1811 and the completion of the Miami and Erie Canal helped the city grow to 115,000 citizens by 1850.<ref name="city-ws"/> 

Construction on the Middletown in 1827 and, by 1840, the canal had reached Toledo, changing the Miami Canal to the Miami and Erie Canal and signifying the connection between the Little Miami River and Lake Erie.

During this period of rapid expansion, citizens of Cincinnati began referring to the city as the "Queen" city. The phrase was cemented in the poem "Catawba Wine" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who wrote that the city was "the Queen of the West," giving the city its nickname. 

Railroads were the next major form of transportation to come to Cincinnati.  In 1836, the Little Miami Railroad was chartered.<ref name="Vexler"></ref> Construction began soon after, with the purpose of connecting Cincinnati with the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad, and thus the ports of the Sandusky Bay.<ref name="Condit" />

On April 1, 1853, Cincinnati's Fire Department became a paid department, the first full-time paid fire department in the United States, and the first in the world to use steam fire engines.<ref name="city-ws-fire"></ref>

Six years later, in 1859, Cincinnati laid out six streetcar lines, making it easier for people to get around the city.<ref name="Vexler" /> By 1872, Cincinnatians could travel on the streetcar line within the city and then be transported by rail car to the hill communities.  The Cincinnati Inclined Plane Company began transporting people to the top of Mount Auburn in that year.<ref name="Condit" />

The Cincinnati Red Stockings, whose name and heritage inspired today's Cincinnati Reds, began their career in the 1800s as well. In 1868, meetings were held at the law offices of Tilden, Sherman, and Moulton to make Cincinnati’s baseball team a professional one; it became the first regular professional team in the country, being organized formally in 1869.<ref name="Vexler" />

In 1879, Ivory Soap.  It got its appeal because of its ability to float. After a fire at their first factory, Procter & Gamble moved to a new factory on the Mill Creek and began soap production again, which eventually led to the area being known as Ivorydale.<ref>Writers' Program of the Works Project Administration, ''Cincinnati: A Guide to the Queen City and its Neighbors''</ref>

Cincinnati weathered the Great Depression better than most American cities of its size, largely because of a resurgence of inexpensive river trade. The rejuvenation of downtown began in the 1920s and continued into the next decade with the construction of Union Terminal, the post office, and a large Bell Telephone building. The flood of 1937 was one of the worst in the nation's history, resulting in the building of protective flood walls. After World War II, Cincinnati unveiled a master plan for urban renewal that resulted in modernization of the inner city. Riverfront Coliseum were completed in the 1970s, as the Cincinnati Reds baseball team emerged as one of the dominant teams of the decade. In December 1979, eleven people were killed in a mass panic prior to a rock-and-roll concert at the Coliseum by the band The Who. In 1989, the 200th anniversary of the city's founding, much attention was focused on the city's Year 2000 plan, which involved further revitalization.

The completion of several major new development projects enhance the city as it enters the early years of the new millennium. Cincinnati's beloved Bengals and Reds teams both have new, state-of-the-art homes: Paul Brown Stadium, opened in 2000; and the Great American Ball Park, opened in 2003, respectively. Two new museums have opened: the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in 2003, and the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in 2004. With many delays and political setbacks, the City of Cincinnati and Hamilton County are currently planning The Banks--a 24-hour urban neighborhood of restaurants, clubs, offices, and homes with sweeping skyline views, along the city's riverfront. Cincinnati has received such accolades as "Most Liveable City" (1993), Partners for Livable Communities, April 2004; number five U.S. arts destination, American Style Magazine, Summer 2004; was the highest rated city in Ohio for "Best Cities For Young Professionals" and 18th overall, Forbes Magazine, June 2007<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/2007/06/21/cities-jobs-young-forbeslife-cx_mw_0621realestate.html Best Cities For Young Professionals - Forbes.com]</ref>;  and inclusion in the top ten "Cities that Rock," Esquire Magazine, April 2004.<ref>The Cincinnati Historical Society</ref>

thumb|left|Cincinnati Museum Center .

Downtown Cincinnati is focused around Fountain Square, a popular public square and gathering place for many events.

Cincinnati is home to numerous structures that are noteworthy due to their architectural characteristics or historic associations including the Carew Tower, the Scripps Center, the Ingalls Building, Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal, and the Isaac M. Wise Temple.

The city is undergoing significant changes due to an influx of new development and private investment as well as the construction of the long stalled Banks project.

A new building may soon be added to the Cincinnati skyline. Queen City Square is scheduled to be open in 2011. The building will be the tallest in Cincinnati and the third tallest in Ohio, reaching a height of 660 feet. <ref></ref> Construction has yet to begin.

==Government==

The city is governed by a nine-member city council, whose members are elected at large. Prior to 1924, city council was elected through a system of wards. The ward system lent itself to corruption and Cincinnati was run by the Republican Republican, city manager form of government. From 1924 to 1957, the council was selected by mayor was chosen in a separate election and the city manager received a lesser role in government; these reforms were referred to as the "strong mayor" reforms. Cincinnati politics include the participation of the Charter Party, the party with the third-longest history of winning in local elections.

==Race relations==

thumb|upright|right|The [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center offers lessons on the struggle for freedom in the past, in the present, and for the future as it attempts to challenge visitors to contemplate the meaning of freedom in their own lives.]]
Before the Civil War, Cincinnati was a bordertown between the states that allowed slavery, such as Kentucky, and those that did not, such as Ohio. Cincinnati and surrounding areas played a major role in Abolitionism. The area was a part of the Underground Railroad and was home to Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her characters in Uncle Tom's Cabin were based on escaped slaves she met in the area.  Levi Coffin made the Cincinnati area the center of his anti slavery efforts in 1847<ref>Reminiscences of Levi Coffin, the reputed president of the underground railroad: being a brief history of the labors of a lifetime in behalf of the slave, with the stories of numerous fugitives, who gained their freedom through his instrumentality, and many other incidents. Coffin, Levi, 1798-1877, Cincinnati: Western tract society, Ann Arbor, Michigan: University of Michigan Library</ref>.  Today, The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center commemorates the era at its center located at 50 East Freedom Way.

In 2001 a series of racially charged riots occurred after the shooting death of an unarmed black male, Timothy Thomas, by police during a foot pursuit.

==Crime==
Before the riot of 2001, Cincinnati's overall crime rate was dropping dramatically and had reached its lowest point since 1992.<ref></ref> After the riot, violent crime increased, but is still well below the level of the 1970s . The police force "work slowdown" correlates with this increase. In 2007 though an article published in the Cincinnati Enquirer on May 30, 2007 affirmed that incidents of violent crime, including homicides, were 15.3 percent lower than they had been in the first four months of 2006. Children's Hospital saw a 78 percent decrease in gunshot wounds, and University Hospital had a 17 percent drop. <ref> Kelley, Eileen and Jane Prendergast. "Good news: Crime's down". ''Cincinnati Enquirer''. 5/30/07. </ref>
 
In May and June 2006, together with the Hamilton County Sheriff, the Cincinnati Police Department created a task force to crack down on crime.  This consisted of an extra twenty deputies assigned to Over-the-Rhine and helped reduce the crime rate of downtown Cincinnati by 29% . This marks a dramatic decrease in crime but has not reduced the crime levels to pre-riot levels.

In the general elections on November 7, 2006, Hamilton County voters rejected a quarter-cent sales tax increase which would have been used to build a new jail system.

The city has attempted to reduce gun violence in Cincinnati by using the Out of the Crossfire program at University Hospital, which is a rehabilitation program for patients with gunshot wounds.  The program attempts to prevent them from falling back into the cycle of violence which many gunshot victims return to after leaving the hospital. <ref>[http://www.outofthecrossfire.org/index.htm Out Of The Crossfire - Cincinnati<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>Mayor Mark Mallory is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition<ref></ref>,  a bi-partisan group with a stated goal of "making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.

2007 saw 68 homicides, nearly a 25% drop from 2006 in which there were 89. Part of this is due to the Out of the Crossfire and Ceasefire programs, which help gunshot victims avoid a life back on the streets after they are released from the hospital. However, this is still not lower than 2000 count of 15 homicides.<ref>
</ref>
As of May 2008, violent crime is down by almost 12% compared to the crime rate at that point last year. The homicide rate is also down by 25%.<ref></ref>
