'''Prince Rogers Nelson''' (født amerikansk prisvindende musiker.

==De unge år: 1978-1982==
Prince har lige siden sin barndom været yderst musikalsk. Siden han var ni har han spillet på bassister og en på trommer. 

I 1978 gik de til et pladeselskab, som var begejstrede for Prince's talent. Derfor fik han lynhurtigt en pladekontrakt. Efter flere måneder i studiet udgav de det overproducerede album ''For You'' som blev et flop. Da albummet kun solgte 400.000, overvejede pladeselskabet, om de skulle fyre ham. Men efter lange diskussioner blev de enige om, at de ville lade ham producere fem plader mere. Året efter udgav de klassikeren ''Prince'' som overraskende blev et hit i USA takket være nummeret "I Wanna Be Your Lover". Albummet solgte godt, og hurtigt fik han kultstatus. 

''Dirty Mind'' blev udgivet i 1980. Albummet var mere New Wawe end de forrige albms, og den blev ikke lige så stor en kassesucces. Titelnummeret blev dog en succes. 

Efter sin første turne i USA, udgav han i 1981 sit fjerde album, ''Controversy''. Albummet blev hans mest solgte i fire år, og tre af singlerne blev hits i USA. Men han havde ikke succes i Europa på det tidspunkt. Efter hans anden turne, den såkaldte "Triple Treat" turne, vendte Prince tilbage til studiet for at lave en mere mainstream lyd.

==Popstjerne: 1982-1990==
I 1982 udgav han så sit femte album ''1999''. Lyden havde ændret sig radikalt. Den var blevet til New Wawe pop, og Prince's look havde ændret sig fra langt hår, til lilla Jimi Hendrix posede skjorter og stramme lilla bukser. Albummet slog igennem Europa og Australien, og solgte 10 millioner eksemplarer. Han blev også den første sorte artist på MTV.

Året efter i 1984 udgav Prince sin første spillefilm ''Purple Rain''. Filmen blev et kæmpe hit, og dens soundtrack solgte over 25 millioner eksemplarer, og havde tre nummer-et hits. 

Efter en kæmpe turne, udgav Prince i 1985 sit syvende album ''Around The World In A Day''. Lyden havde ændret sig til psykedelisk pop, og hans fans blev skuffede over lyden. Albummet solgte 10,2 millioner, og havde to hits, "Raspberry Beret" og "America".

I 1986 udgav Prince sin anden spillefilm "Under The Cherry Moon". Selv om kritikerne generelt var positive, blev filmen ikke lige så stor en succes som Purple Rain. Soundtracket (Parade) blev dog hans næstbedst sælgende album med hele 16 millioner eksemplarer takket være #1 hittet "Kiss".

Året efter udgav Prince ''Sign O The Times''. Albummet solgte godt, og fik to hits. Prince tog efterfølgende på sin femte verdensturne. 

I 1988 udgav han sit 10 album ''LoveSexy''. I tiden mellem "Sign "O" The Times" og "LoveSexy" havde han færdiggjort albummet "The Black Album", som han dog kort før udgivelsen valgte at trække tilbage.
De næste to år, udgav han to soundtracks til to forskellige film. Begge blev fiaskoer.

'''Prince Rogers Nelson''' (born Minneapolis, Minnesota) is an American musician. He performs simply as '''Prince''', but has also been known by various other names, among them an unpronounceable symbol, leading fans and critics to dub him "The Artist (Formerly Known As Prince)," occasionally abbreviated as "TAFKAP."

Prince is a prolific artist, having released several hundred songs both under his own name and with other artists. He has won six Grammy Awards and an Academy Award, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2004, he was named as the top male pop artist of the past 25 years by ARC Rock on the Net,<ref>http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2004/toppop1.htm</ref> and Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Prince #28 on their list of the [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty/ 100 Greatest Artists of All Time].<ref name="autogenerated2"></ref>

From his early material, rooted in soul and pop, rock, jazz, psychedelia and hip hop. Some of his primary influences include Sly Stone, Curtis Mayfield, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, and Carlos Santana.  The distinctive characteristics of the early-to-mid 1980s work, such as sparse and industrial-sounding drum machine arrangements and the use of synthesizer riffs to serve the role traditionally occupied by horn riffs in earlier R&B, funk and soul music&mdash;was called the "Minneapolis sound" and has proved very influential.  Known to be a perfectionist, Prince is highly protective of his music. He produces, composes, arranges and performs nearly all of the songs on his albums.

== Biography ==
=== Uptown: Early years ===
Prince Rogers Nelson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on June 7, 1958, to John L. Nelson and Mattie Shaw.<ref>''Prince: Inside the Purple Reign.'' Retrieved on February 11, 2007.</ref> John was a pianist and songwriter, and Mattie was a singer. He is named after the Prince Rogers Trio, his father's jazz band, and as a boy he was called Skipper.

There are a number of myths regarding Prince's ethnicity, some spread by Prince himself.<ref>princebio.com</ref> In fact, he was born to a black mother and a black father. According to a 1985 Rolling Stone article, Mattie Shaw, like many African-Americans, is an amalgam of different ethnicities. The article in question affirms Shaw as: "a singer sixteen years John's junior, Mattie bore traces of Billie Holiday in her pipes and more than a trace of Indian and Caucasian in her blood." After the birth of his sister Tyka in 1960, Prince's parents gradually drifted apart. After they formally separated, he had a troubled relationship with his stepfather that resulted in his running away from home. Prince lived briefly with his father, who bought him his first guitar, and later he moved in with a neighborhood family, the Andersons, befriending their son, Andre Anderson (later called André Cymone).

Prince and Anderson joined Prince's cousin Charles Smith in a band called Grand Central that they formed in junior high school. His initial contributions were as an instrumentalist in what was a mainly instrumental band that played clubs and parties in the Minneapolis area. As time went by and Prince's musical interests broadened, he found himself producing the arrangements for the band. Before long he became the band's front man. By the time Prince entered high school, Grand Central evolved into Champagne and started playing original music already drawing on a range of influences including Sly & The Family Stone, James Brown, Earth Wind & Fire, Miles Davis, Parliament-Funkadelic and Jimi Hendrix. At one point Prince was a student at the Minnesota Dance Theatre.

In 1976, he started work on a demo tape with producer Chris Moon in a Minneapolis studio. Prince also had the patronage of Owen Husney, to whom Moon introduced him, a connection that helped him produce a high-quality demo recording. Husney started contacting major labels and ran a campaign promoting Prince as a star of the future, resulting in a bidding war eventually won by Warner Bros. Records. They offered him a contract and were the only label to give Prince creative control of his songs.

=== First steps: 1977–1980 ===
Pepe Willie, husband of Prince's cousin, Shantel, was an influence in Prince's early career. Along with Husney, Willie acted as mentor and manager for Prince in the Grand Central days, and he employed Prince in the studio for his own recordings. In 1977, Willie formed 94 East, a band with Marcy Ingvoldstad and Kristie Lazenberry. 94 East comprised a group of singers and musicians that included Andre Cymone and Prince. Prince composed the music for Willie's lyrics and typically played guitar and keyboards in the studio. He wrote many songs for the group, including "Just Another Sucker." The band recorded an album, ''Minneapolis Genius – The Historic 1977 Recordings''. Although it was not a solo album and was not commercially released until many years later, it is considered Prince's first professional album. For unknown reasons, Prince does not acknowledge the existence of this album. In 1995, the original recordings with Prince and Cymone were released by Willie as ''94 East featuring Prince, Symbolic Beginning''.

Prince released his first album, ''For You'', on April 7, 1978. ''For You'' was the first major-label album released by Prince, his first of many for Warner Bros. Tommy Vicari was the executive producer. This album, like most of his career, was not recorded with a band; Prince purportedly played all 27 instruments on the album. Critics detract from the impressiveness of this fact by qualifying them as "merely" different types of string, percussion, and keyboard instruments.

The majority of ''For You'' was written and performed by Prince, except for the song "Soft and Wet" (lyrics co-written by Moon). This was the first of Prince's albums containing the now ubiquitous legend: "Produced, Arranged, Composed and Performed by Prince." Prince spent twice his initial advance recording the album, which sold modestly and made the bottom reaches of the R&B charts. Prince used ''Prince's Music Co.'' for publishing the songs from this album. The single reached #12 on the Soul chart and #92 on the pop chart. "Just as Long as We're Together" flopped at #91 on the soul chart.

By 1979, Prince had recruited his first backing band featuring Andre Cymone (Anderson) on bass, Gayle Chapman and Doctor Fink on keyboards, Bobby Z on drums, and Dez Dickerson on guitar. Prince intentionally enlisted a multi-racial, mixed-gender group, much like the backing band of one of his greatest influences, Sly Stone. They had their first shows at the Capri Theatre on January 5 and 6 1979. Reportedly, Prince mostly mumbled into the microphone, whilst Dez and Andre ran back and forth into the audience. Warner executives were at the second show, which was plagued with electrical difficulties and a snowstorm, and decided Prince had promise but the band needed more time to gel before it could tour. This was just after their gear was stolen from their rehearsal base at Dels Tyre Mart.<ref>Prince: A Pop Life. Dave Hill, 1989, London Faber and Faber</ref>

In October 1979, Prince released his self-titled second album ''Prince'', which reached #4 on the Billboard R&B charts, and contained two R&B hits: "BMI'' <ref>[http://repertoire.bmi.com/publisher.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=99813&keyname=ECNIRP%20MUSIC&querytype=PubID BMI | Repertoire Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> for publishing his songs, which he would also use for the album ''Dirty Mind''. ''Prince'' has been certified gold status; the single "I Wanna Be Your Lover" reached #1 on the R&B charts, also hitting #11 on the Billboard Top 100 American pop charts. This became known as one of his greatest hits.

===1980–1984===
In 1980, Prince released ''Lisa Coleman replaced Chapman in the band, who felt the sexually explicit lyrics and stage antics of Prince's concerts conflicted with her religious beliefs. ''Dirty Mind'' is particularly notable for its sexually explicit material.

Prince opened for a 1980 tour with the label "Controversy'' in 1981, with the single of the same name charting internationally for the first time. In February of 1981, Prince performed "Partyup" on the now-infamous season six episode of Jean Doumanian's lackluster tenure as executive producer down when cast member Emancipation'' in 1996.

During this period, Prince began to attract attention for the clothes he wore onstage. He wore high-heeled shoes and boots and tended to flaunt and express an intense sexuality onstage in addition to in his music, using symbols associated with booed off the stage for his wardrobe. These shows occurred just before the release of ''Controversy'' and also when he was breaking in his new bassist Mark Brown (later BrownMark), who was then just 18 and out of high school.

In 1981, Prince formed a "side project"(a problematic label given that his band was only used for performance, not recording sessions) band called The Time. Prince was able to do this thanks to a clause in his contract with Warner Bros. The Time released four albums between 1981 and 1990, with Prince writing and performing all instruments and backing vocals throughout. The band's vocals were led by Morris Day.

In the coming decade, Prince would also collaborate with Vanity (of Apollonia (of Tom Jones, and The Family, was a huge commercial success in 1990.

In 1982, Prince released the ''1999'' double-album which "broke" Prince into the mainstream in the US and internationally, selling over three million copies.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/1999/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/20/wb.prince.bio/ CNN – WorldBeat Biography – Prince – title track was a protest of Delirious" also went top ten on the Billboard Hot 100. The album was placed at number six in The Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1983.

Around this time Prince began crediting his band as The Revolution, which consisted of Lisa Coleman and Brown Mark on bass. The band's name was printed in reverse on the cover of ''1999''; Prince refrained using the name "The Revolution" until Dickerson left the band for personal reasons. Dickerson was replaced by Wendy Melvoin, a childhood friend of Lisa. The band members were known for being solid musicians and a strong live act, but their talents would be used sparsely in the studio. Their presence in Prince's recordings, however, would increase through the mid-1980s.

During this period, Prince recorded many acclaimed b-sides&mdash;songs that were previously released on the b-side of a single that were, at times, "throwaway" songs&mdash;becoming popular songs in their own right. Some greats and fan favorites include "How Come You Don't Call Me Anymore," b-side for "1999"; "Erotic City," b-side for "Let's Go Crazy"; and "17 Days," b-side for "When Doves Cry." Several of these b-sides were covered by mainstream artists, including Alicia Keys and Living Colour.

===1984–1987===
Prince's 1984 album, ''Purple Rain'' (concurrent with the film of the same name) sold more than thirteen million copies in the US and spent twenty-four consecutive weeks at #1 on the Billboard 200. The Academy Award-winning film grossed more than $80 million in the US alone, and has proved to be Prince's biggest cinematic success to date.

Two songs from ''Purple Rain'', "title track reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Prince simultaneously held the spots #1 film, #1 single, and #1 album in the US. He won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for "Purple Rain," and the album ranks at 72 in the top 100 of ''Rolling Stone's'' TIME Magazine''.

It was the album's song "Karenna, listening that inspired her to found the Parents Music Resource Center. The center has enacted the mandatory use of a warning label ("Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics") on the covers of records that have been judged to contain language or lyrical content unsuitable for minors. The end of the song contains a backward-masked message contradictory with the theme of the song. Playing the song backward reveals the message:

:"Hello.
:How are you?
:I'm fine
:Cause I know that Lord is coming soon. Coming…coming…soon."

In 1985, after the U.S. ''Purple Rain'' Tour, which was a smash hit in the US and Canada, Prince announced that he would discontinue both live performances and music videos after the release of ''Around the World in a Day'', which held the #1 spot on the Billboard 200 album chart for three weeks. Prince's ban on music videos supposedly ended when the album stalled in the charts and, after a video for "Raspberry Beret," then reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100.

In 1986, Prince released the album ''Parade''. The album went to #3 on the Billboard 200 album chart and #2 on the R&B album charts. The first single, "Kiss," would top the Billboard Hot 100. At the same time, "Manic Monday" by The Bangles, which Prince had written under the pseudonym "Christopher Tracey," reached #2 on the Hot 100.

Christopher Tracy was the name of Prince's character in the movie "Under The Cherry Moon," for which ''Parade'' served as a soundtrack. Prince both directed and starred in the movie, and it also featured Kristen Scott Thomas as Mary Sharon in her first movie role. She would go on to star in such films as "The English Patient." Following the film and album, Prince returned to touring with a stripped-down show. After a few isolated dates (dubbed "the Hit and Run Tour") in the United States, he embarked on his first full scale European Tour in the summer of 1986. He closed the tour in September in Japan, his first appearances in the country.

At the end of the tour, Prince disbanded The Revolution, although retaining band member Matt Fink on keyboard. Added to the backing band was Boni Boyer on keyboards, Sheila E on drums, Levi Seacer, Jr. on bass, and Miko Weaver on guitar.

===1987–1991===
''Sign o' the Times'', released in 1987 as a double album, reached the Top Ten of the Billboard 200 and achieved the greatest critical acclaim of his career, topping the annual and highly reputable Rolling Stone's'' list<ref name="RollingStone" /> and The All-TIME 100 Albums<ref name="TIMEMagazine" /> of ''TIME Magazine'', which declared it was the best album of the 1980s. Following the albums' release, Prince launched the ''Sign o' the Times'' Tour in Europe.
1987 saw the potential for two of pop's biggest stars coming together to perform a duet. Bad''. Jackson and Prince ended up having creative differences, however, and Jackson recorded the title track for the album alone.<ref>[http://michaeljackson.com/lofi/history-main-1980s.html Michael Jackson<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1987, Prince planned to release ''The Black Album'', a funk-oriented album whose erotically-charged lyrics and club-focused beats were perceived by many as his attempt to woo back the black audience he was supposed to have lost as a result of his mid-80s forays into pop, hard rock, and psychedelic rock. In reality, the album was a collection of tracks recorded during the previous few years, some of which had initially been recorded for Sheila E's birthday party in 1986.<ref name="autogenerated1"> Retrieved on May 15, 2007</ref>

The album remains legendary in Prince's career after its release was canceled at the artist's behest mere days before its release date. Though many already manufactured copies were supposed to be destroyed, several escaped and became the source for numerous bootleg editions. The album circulated through the bootleg Ecstasy.

The 1988 album ''The Black Album''. ''Lovesexy'' performed disappointingly on the US charts, reaching only #11 on the Billboard 200, but it reached #1 in the UK. (One track from ''The Black Album,'' "When 2 R in Love," also appeared on ''Lovesexy.'') The US leg of the Lovesexy World Tour also proved to be commercial disappointment: Prince lost money as dates failed to sell out. He did balance this poor performance with the European and Japanese legs of the tour.

In 1989, Prince provided and released the soundtrack for ''Batman'', which returned him to #1 on the US album charts. The worldwide hit-single "Batdance" reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, while another track, "Partyman," featuring the vocals of his then girlfriend "Anna Garcia"<ref> Retrieved on August 15, 2007</ref> became a popular song with the film's audiences.

In 1990, Prince released the film ''Graffiti Bridge'', a sequel to ''Purple Rain'' that performed poorly at the box office. The soundtrack to "Graffiti Bridge" featured Prince along with artists such as The Time. It would peak at #6 in the US and reach #1 in the UK. He also collaborated with Madonna on her ''Like a Prayer'' album for the song entitled "Love Song."

===1991–1994===

The release of ''Cream." ''Diamonds and Pearls'' debuted Prince's new band, the New Power Generation, that featured rapper Tony M., Rosie Gaines on vocals, Michael Bland on drums, Levi Seacer on guitar, Sonny T on bass, and Tommy Barbarella on keyboards.

1993 found Prince working significantly on The Red Shoes''; her name appears in the credits of his ''Diamonds and Pearls'' album. Prince chiefly contributed on the song "Why Should I Love You," playing bass, guitar, and keyboards, singing vocals, and arranging music for the mix. This would be the final "Prince" credit, until 2000. Kate Bush reciprocated in 1996 and is featured on background vocals on the ''Emancipation'' track, "My Computer."

Prince's twelfth album was titled with an unpronounceable symbol (later copyrighted as "Love Symbol #2").<ref name="nytimes_07-11-02">

</ref> It reached the top ten of the U.S. album charts. In 1993, he also changed his stage name to the Love Symbol, which is a combination of the symbols for male (♂) and female (♀). Because the symbol was/is unpronounceable, he was often referred to as "Symbol," "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince," or simply "The Artist." In 1993, at the request of Warner Brothers, Prince released a 3-CD Peach," were chosen as promotional singles to accompany the compilation album. Unfortunately, neither the album nor singles performed as well in sales as Warner Bros. had hoped, however, ''The Hits'' offers arguably the most thorough overview of Prince's musical output from 1978–1993.

====Name change====
In 1993, during negotiations regarding the release of Prince's album ''The Gold Experience'', a legal battle ensued between Warner Bros. and Prince over the artistic and financial control of Prince's output. During the lawsuit, Prince appeared in public with the word "slave" written on his cheek. Prince explained his name change as follows:

{{cquote| The first step I have taken towards the ultimate goal of emancipation from the chains that bind me to Warner Bros. was to change my name from Prince to the Love Symbol. Prince is the name that my Mother gave me at birth. Warner Bros. took the name, trademarked it, and used it as the main marketing tool to promote all of the music that I wrote. The company owns the name Prince and all related music marketed under Prince. I became merely a pawn used to produce more money for Warner Bros…

I was born Prince and did not want to adopt another conventional name. The only acceptable replacement for my name, and my identity, was the Love Symbol, a symbol with no pronunciation, that is a representation of me and what my music is about. This symbol is present in my work over the years; it is a concept that has evolved from my frustration; it is who I am. It is my name. }}

Critics have argued Prince's name change as an attempt by the artist to reinvent himself, providing an opportunity to redevelop his style. One commentator noted:

<blockquote>Prince started his career as a big R&B star with limited mainstream success. At that point, he left the middle of the road and headed for the ditch. In 1980, it was risky to record new wave songs with lusty lyrics that assured no radio airplay (the classic ''Dirty Mind''), but it paid off. Critics took notice and he became an underground favorite. This paved the way for his huge success with ''1999'' and ''Purple Rain''. Certainly that was the pinnacle of his career, as far as worldwide earnings and universal adulation are concerned. But by heading for the ditch again, by changing his name and experimenting with his style, by lowering his stock value and escaping his record contract, Prince has become an underground artist again. In late 1996, the first collection of Prince music since his break with Warner Bros. appeared in record stores, a sprawling three-hour extravaganza integrating great dance grooves and slow-burning ballads. Critical response has been overwhelmingly positive, and sales have been brisk despite the high price of a 3-CD set. It's no coincidence that he titled this album ''Emancipation''.<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/brenhow/name_change.html I WOULD DIE 4 U<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>

===1994–2000===

In 1994, Prince's attitude towards his artistic output underwent a notable shift. He began to view releasing albums in quick succession as a means of ejecting himself from his contractual obligations to Warner Bros. The label, he believed, was intent on limiting his artistic freedom by insisting that he release albums more sporadically. He also blamed Warner Bros. for the poor commercial performance of the ''Love Symbol'' album, claiming that it was insufficiently marketed by Warner. It was out of these developments that the aborted ''The Black Album'' was officially released, approximately seven years after its initial recording and near-release. The "new" release, which was already in wide circulation as a bootleg, sold relatively poorly.

Following that disappointing venture, Warner Bros. succumbed to Prince's wishes to release an album of new material, to be entitled ''Come''. When ''Come'' was eventually released, it confirmed all of Warner's fears. It became Prince's poorest-selling album to date, struggling to even shift 500,000 copies. Even more frustrating was the fact that Prince insisted on crediting the album to "Prince 1958–1993."

Prince pushed to have his next album ''The Most Beautiful Girl in the World" to be released via a small, independent distributor, Bellmark Records, in February 1994. The release was successful, reaching #3 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and #1 in many other countries, but it would not prove to be a model for subsequent releases. Warner Bros. still resisted releasing ''The Gold Experience'', fearing poor sales and citing "market saturation" as a defense. When eventually released in September 1995, ''The Gold Experience'' failed to sell well, although it reached the top 10 of the Billboard 200 initially, and many reviewed it as Prince's best effort since ''Sign o' the Times''. The album is now out-of-print.

''Emancipation''. The album was released via his own NPG Records with distribution through EMI. To publish his songs in ''Emancipation'', Prince did not use ''Controversy Music'' – ''ASCAP'', which he had used for all his records since 1981, but rather used ''Emancipated Music Inc.''<ref>[http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=PRINCE&search_in=a&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=30&start=1 ASCAP profile for Emancipated Music]</ref> – ''ASCAP''.

Prince released ''Crystal Ball'', a 4-CD collection of unreleased material, in 1998. The distribution of this album was disorderly, with some fans pre-ordering the album on his website up to a year before it was eventually shipped to them, and months after the record had gone on sale in retail stores. The ''Newpower Soul'' album released three months later failed to make much of an impression on the charts. His collaboration with Chaka Khan, ''Come 2 My House'' released on the NPG Records label, met with the same fate.

In 1999, Prince once again signed with a major label Arista Records to release a new record, ''Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic''. In an attempt to make his new album a success, Prince gave more interviews than at any other point in his career. Nevertheless ''Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic '' failed to perform commercially. A few months earlier, Warner Bros. had also released ''The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale'', a collection of unreleased material recorded by Prince throughout his career, and his final recording commitment on his contract with Warner Bros. The greatest success he had during the year was with the EP ''1999: The New Master'', released in time for Prince to collect a small portion of the sales dollars Warner Bros. had been seeing for the album and singles of the original ''1999''. Both critics and fans panned ''The New Master'', declaring it unimaginative.

The pay-per-view concert, ''George Clinton, and The Time. It was released to home video the following year. A remix album, ''Rave In2 The Joy Fantastic'' (as opposed to "Un2") was released exclusively through Prince's NPG Music Club in April 2000.
