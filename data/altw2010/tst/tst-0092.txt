}}'''Meddle''' is een studioalbum van de Britse progressieve rockband Pink Floyd uit 1971. Het album werd opgenomen tussen januari en augustus 1971. 

De eerste opnamen werden gemaakt in EMI's Abbey Road Studios, maar omdat deze studie slechts beschikte over 8-sporen opnameapparatuur werden andere studios gezocht die 16-sporen apparatuur hadden. In de AIR Studios en Morgan Studios werden de overige stukken opgenomen.

==Overview==

Though the tracks have a variety of moods, ''Meddle'' is generally considered more cohesive than its 1970 predecessor ''charts), but lacklustre publicity on the part of Capitol Records led to weak sales in the U.S. However, ''Meddle'' was later  certified Gold by the RIAA in October of 1973 and then double platinum on 11 March 1994 following the added attention garnered by the band's later successes in America.

"quiet, acoustic love songs in the Pink Floyd catalogue. These two songs segue into each other via wind effects, anticipating the same technique that would later be used on ''Wish You Were Here''.

The song "Fearless" employs Kop choir singing "You'll Never Walk Alone", their anthem, which brings the song to an end in a heavily reverberated fade-out. "San Tropez", by extreme contrast, is a pop song with a shuffle tempo, composed by Waters in his increasingly-deployed style of breezy, off-the-cuff songwriting. Pink Floyd give a rare glimpse into their sense of humour with "Seamus", a pseudo-blues number featuring a dog howling along to the music. "Seamus" was remade as "Mademoiselle Nobs", featuring a different dog and no lyrics, in the film ''Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii''.

The final song on the album is the 23-minute underwater epic "Echoes". "Echoes" also gave its name to the compilation album ''Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd'', on which a much-edited version of the title track was included. In the compilation, multiple edits throughout the entire song cut the running length of the piece down by some 7 minutes.

==Recording and release==
Pink Floyd began production on the album at EMI's famous Abbey Road Studios, where most of their other projects had been recorded and mixed. Lacking a central theme for the project, the band decided to work on new material individually without listening to the other band members' contributions. They had already tried such an approach with limited success for ''Ummagumma''. However, this time the band resolved to work on one collaborative piece rather than separate solo efforts. The result of one such experiment, which centered around the sound of a grand piano sent through a Leslie speaker, provided inspiration for what would later become "Echoes".

Unfortunately, Abbey Road was still only outfitted with 8-track multitrack recording facilities, which Pink Floyd found insufficient for the increasing technical demands of their project. They transferred their best efforts, including the opening of "Echoes", to 16-track tape at smaller studios in London (namely AIR and Morgan) and resumed work with the advantage of more flexible recording equipment. Engineers John Leckie and Peter Bown recorded the main Abbey Road and AIR sessions, while for minor work at Morgan studios in West Hampstead Rob Black and Roger Quested handled the engineering duties. The band also spent several days in late September 1971 preparing a quadrophonic mix of the album at Command Studios. Reportedly, this was played at the album's press premiere. However, it has never been released to the public. [http://www.pinkfloydonline.com/timeline.html]

Outtakes from the album sessions are rumoured to include an unreleased song entitled "The Dark Side of the Moon", which later became "Brain Damage", and two demo versions of "One of These Days", both of which have been made available on bootlegs and include cut-up speech samples of Radio DJ Sir Jimmy Young.
