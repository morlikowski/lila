==Biography==
===Early life===
Hendrik Lorentz was born in National Gallery of Amsterdam. Hendrik and Aletta's eldest daughter Geertruida Luberta Lorentz was to become a physicist as well.

===Professor in Leiden===
In 1878, only 24 years of age, Lorentz was appointed to the newly established chair in theoretical physics at the University of Leiden. On January 25 1878, he delivered his inaugural lecture on ''""'' (The molecular theories in physics).

During the first twenty years in Leiden, Lorentz was primarily interested in the theory of electromagnetism to explain the relationship of electricity, magnetism, and light. After that, he extended his research to a much wider area while still focusing on theoretical physics. From his publications, it appears that Lorentz made contributions to mechanics, thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, kinetic theories, solid state theory, light, and propagation. His most important contributions were in the area of electromagnetism, the electron theory, and relativity.

Lorentz theorized that the atoms might consist of charged particles and suggested that the oscillations of these charged particles were the source of light. When colleague and former student of Lorentz Pieter Zeeman discovered the Zeeman effect in 1896, Lorentz supplied its theoretical interpretation. The experimental and theoretical work was honored with the Nobel prize in physics in 1902. Lorentz' name is now associated with the Lorentz-Lorenz formula, the Lorentz force, the Lorentzian distribution, and the Lorentz transformation.

===Electrodynamics and "relativity"===

In 1892, with the attempt to explain the Michelson-Morley experiment, Lorentz  proposed that moving bodies contract in the direction of motion (see length contraction; George FitzGerald had already arrived at this conclusion, see FitzGerald-Lorentz Contraction).  Lorentz worked on describing electromagentic phenomena (the propagation of light) in reference frames that moved relative to each other. He discovered that the transition from one to another reference frame could be simplified by using a new time variable which he called ''local time''. The local time depended on the universal time and the location under consideration. Lorentz publications (of 1895<ref>{{citation |first = Hendrik Antoon |last = Lorentz |title = Versuch einer theorie der electrischen und optischen erscheinungen bewegten koerpern |url = http://www.historyofscience.nl/search/detail.cfm?pubid=2690&view=image&startrow=1 |place =  Leiden
|year = 1895}}</ref> and 1899) <ref></ref> made use of the term local time without giving a detailed interpretation of its physical relevance. In 1900, Henri Poincaré called Lorentz's local time a "wonderful invention" and illustrated it by showing that clocks in moving frames are synchronized by exchanging light signals that are assumed to travel  at the same speed against and with the motion of the frame.<ref></ref>
 
In 1899, and again in 1904,<ref>{{citation |first = Hendrik Antoon |last = Lorentz |title = Electromagnetic phenomena in a system moving with any velocity smaller than that of light |url = http://www.historyofscience.nl/search/detail.cfm?pubid=615&view=image&startrow=1 |journal = 
Proc. Acad. Science Amsterdam |volume = 6  |year = 1904 |pages =  809-831}}</ref>
Lorentz added time dilation to his transformations and published what Poincaré in 1905 named Lorentz transformations. It was apparently unknown to Lorentz that Joseph Larmor had used identical transformations to describe orbiting electrons in 1897. Larmor's and Lorentz's equations look somewhat unfamiliar, but they are algebraically equivalent to those presented by Poincaré and Einstein in 1905.<ref></ref> Lorentz' 1904 paper includes the covariant formulation of electrodynamics, in which electrodynamic phenomena in different reference frames are described by identical equations with well defined transformation properties.  The paper clearly recognizes the significance of this formulation, namely that the outcomes of electrodynamic experiments do not depend on the relative motion of the reference frame. The 1904 paper includes a 
detailed discussion of the increase of the inertial mass of rapidly moving objects. In 1905, Einstein would use many of the concepts, mathematical tools and results discussed to write his paper entitled "" (Electrodynamics) known today as the theory of special relativity. Because Lorentz laid the fundaments for the work by Einstein, this theory was called the ''Lorentz-Einstein theory'' originally.

The increase of mass was the first prediction of special relativity to be tested, but from early experiments by Kaufmann it appeared that his prediction was wrong; this led Lorentz to the famous remark that he was "at the end of his Latin."[http://web.archive.org/web/20050221211608/www.univ-nancy2.fr/poincare/chp/text/lorentz1.html]  The confirmation 
of his prediction had to wait until 1908. In 1909, Lorentz published "Theory of Electrons" based 
on a series of lectures in Mathematical Physics he gave at Columbia University.<ref>. The book was republished as recently as 2003. The 1916 edition is available online at http://www.archive.org/details/electronstheory00lorerich</ref> 

====Assessments====

Poincaré (1902) said of Lorentz's theory of electrodynamics:

:''The most satisfactory theory is that of Lorentz; it is unquestionably the theory that best explains the known facts, the one that throws into relief the greatest number of known relations ... it is due to Lorentz that the results of Zeeman phenomenon found its place, and even aided the classification of Faraday's magnetic rotation, which had defied all Maxwell's efforts.''<ref> : n.p..  The quotation is from the English translation ()</ref>

Paul Langevin (1911) said of Lorentz:

:''It is the great merit of H. A. Lorentz to have seen that the fundamental equations of electromagnetism admit a group of transformations which enables them to have the same form when one passes from one frame of reference to another; this new transformation has the most profound implications for the transformations of space and time'' <ref> :n.p.</ref>
Lorentz and Emil Wiechert (Göttingen) have had a interesting correspondence on the topic of electromagnetism and theory of relativity, and Lorentz explained his ideas in letters to Wiecehrt. The correspondence between Lorentz and Wiechert has been published by Wilfried Schröder (Arch. ex. hist. Sci, 1984).

Lorentz was chairman of the first Poincaré wrote an essay on quantum physics which gives an indication of Lorentz's status at the time:

:'' ... at every moment [the twenty physicists from different countries] could be heard talking of the [quantum mechanics] which they contrasted with the old mechanics. Now what was the old mechanics? Was it that of Newton, the one which still reigned uncontested at the close of the nineteenth century? No, it was the mechanics of Lorentz, the one dealing with the principle of relativity; the one which, hardly five years ago, seemed to be the height of boldness.''<ref> :n.p..

Albert Einstein (1953) wrote of Lorentz:

:''For me personally he meant more than all the others I have met on my life's journey.''<ref>[http://books.google.nl/books?id=EF2fKDpp8S8C&pg=PA375&lpg=PA375&dq=%22For+me+personally+he+meant+more+than+all+the+others+I+have+met+on+my+life%27s+journey%22&source=web&ots=XPV0HbS5AT&sig=nV8cYUvnu8Wq0_u45wEnYuh6J0s&hl=nl&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result Link]</ref>

===Later life===

In 1912 Lorentz retired early to become director of research at Teylers Museum in Haarlem, although he remained external professor at Leiden and gave weekly lectures there. Paul Ehrenfest succeeded him in his chair at the University of Leiden, founding the Institute for Theoretical Physics which would become known as the Lorentz Institute. In addition to the Nobel prize, Lorentz received a great many honours for his outstanding work. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1905. The Society awarded him their Rumford Medal in 1908 and their Copley Medal in 1918.

While Lorentz is mostly known for fundamental theoretical work, he also had an interest in practical applications. In the years 1918-1926, at the request of the Dutch government, Lorentz headed a committee to calculate some of the effects of the proposed Afsluitdijk (Closure Dike) flood control dam on other seaworks in the Netherlands. Hydraulic engineering was mainly an empirical science at that time, but the disturbance of the tidal flow caused by the Afsluitdijk was so unprecedented that the empirical rules could not be trusted. Lorentz proposed to start from the basic hydrodynamic equations of motion and solve the problem numerically. This was feasible for a "human computer", because of the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the water flow in the Waddenzee. The Afsluitdijk was completed in 1933 and the predictions of Lorentz and his committee turned out to be remarkably accurate.<ref> See </ref>

===Death and legacy===
Lorentz died in Haarlem, Netherlands.  The respect in which he was held in the Netherlands is apparent from O. W. Richardson's description of his funeral:

:''The funeral took place at Haarlem at noon on Friday, February 10. At the stroke of twelve the State telegraph and telephone services of Holland were suspended for three minutes as a revered tribute to the greatest man Holland has produced in our time. It was attended by many colleagues and distinguished physicists from foreign countries. The President, Sir Ernest Rutherford, represented the Royal Society and made an appreciative oration by the graveside.'' <ref> : n.p.

Richardson describes Lorentz as:

:''[A] man of remarkable intellectual powers ... . Although steeped in his own investigation of the moment, he always seemed to have in his immediate grasp its ramifications into every corner of the universe. ... The singular clearness of his writings provides a striking reflection of his wonderful powers in this respect. .... He possessed and successfully employed the mental vivacity which is necessary to follow the interplay of discussion, the insight which is required to extract those statements which illuminate the real difficulties, and the wisdom to lead the discussion among fruitful channels, and he did this so skillfully that the process was hardly perceptible.'' <ref> : n.p.

M. J. Klein (1967) wrote of Lorentz's reputation in the 1920s:

:''For many years physicists had always been eager "to hear what Lorentz will say about it" when a new theory was advanced, and, even at seventy-two, he did not disappoint them.'' <ref> :n.p.  </ref>

== Leben ==

Hendrik Antoon Lorentz wurde am 18. Juli 1853 als Sohn von Gerrit Frederik Lorentz und seiner Mutter Geertruida van Ginkel in Arnheim geboren. Nach dem Tod seiner Mutter heiratete sein Vater 1862 Luberta Hupkes. 1870 ging er an die promovierte 1875 im Alter von 22 Jahren. Er besetzte 1878 als Professor für theoretische Physik einen eigens für ihn eingerichteten Lehrstuhl an der Universität Leiden, der er Zeit seines Lebens treu blieb. 
Zwischen Lorentz und dem Göttinger Physiker Emil Wiechert bestand eine jahrelange Freundschaft. Lorentz hat Wiechert in mehreren Briefen die Entwicklung des Relativprinzips erläutert und einen wichtigen Beitrag damit zur Geschichte der Einsteinschen Theorie geliefert. Der Briefwechsel zwischen Lorenz und Wiechert wurde von Wilfried Schröder in "Arch. hist. ex. Sci" 1984 veröffentlicht.

Lorentz heiratete 1881 Aletta Catharina Kaiser, deren Vater Johann Wilhelm Kaiser Professor an der Akademie der Schönen Künste und Direktor des Rijksmuseums in Amsterdam war. Sie hatten zwei Töchter und einen Sohn. Seine älteste Tochter Dr. Geertruida Luberta Lorentz studierte ebenfalls Physik und war mit Wander Johannes de Haas verheiratet.,

Hendrik Antoon Lorentz gilt als führende Persönlichkeit der theoretischen Physik seiner Zeit, der die elektromagnetische Theorie des Lichtes sowie die Elektronentheorie der Materie entwickelte und auch eine widerspruchsfreie Theorie von Elektrizität, Magnetismus und Licht formulierte.

Er beschäftigte sich schon zu Beginn seines wissenschaftlichen Schaffens mit der Erweiterung der maxwellschen Theorie der Elektrizität und des Lichts. So führte er bereits in seiner Doktorarbeit neue Konzepte ein und seine weiteren Arbeiten auf diesem Gebiet revolutionierten die Vorstellungen von der Natur der Materie. 1878 veröffentlichte er eine Untersuchung über den Zusammenhang der Geschwindigkeit von Licht und der Dichte und Zusammensetzung des Durchgangsmediums.

Ein Schwerpunkt von Lorentz' Arbeit war die Bewegung elektrisch geladener Teilchen. So postulierte er das Konzept des Lorentz-Äthertheorie das Verhalten von Licht beim Durchgang durch bewegte, transparente Körper erklären.

Gemeinsam mit dem irischen Physiker Lorentz-FitzGerald-Kontraktion. Lorentz entwickelte 1895 für Größen erster Ordnung und 1899 bzw. 1904 für Größen zweiter Ordnung die nach ihm benannte allgemeiner Relativitätstheorie. 

Für die Erklärung des Zeeman-Effekts teilten sich Lorentz und der niederländische Physiker Pieter Zeeman 1902 den Nobelpreis für Physik als Anerkennung ''„des außerordentlichen Verdienstes, das sie sich durch ihre Untersuchungen über den Einfluss des Magnetismus auf die Strahlungsphänomene erworben haben“''<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1902/ Nobelpreisauszeichnung 1902]</ref> und ihrer ''„bahnbrechenden Arbeiten über den Zusammenhang zwischen optischen und elektromagnetischen Erscheinungen“''<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1902/press.html Nobel Presentation Speech]</ref>. Lorentz argumentierte in der Nobelrede ganz im Sinne seiner Äthervorstellungen, weshalb er einleitend auch gleich feststellt: 

Lorentz wurde 1919 zum Leiter des Komitees ernannt, das im Rahmen der Planung der Zuiderzeewerke die Auswirkungen der Eindeichungsmaßnahmen auf den Wasserspiegel untersuchen sollte. Seine in den folgenden acht Jahren ausgeführten theoretischen Berechnungen wurden durch jahrzehntelange Praxis nach dem Bau der Deiche bestätigt.
