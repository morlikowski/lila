'''Operation Pugilist''' was an Allied operation in Bernard Montgomery stated:
:The object of operation ''Pugilist'' is to destroy the enemy now opposing Eighth Army in the Mareth position, and to advance and capture Sfax.<ref>[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Bard-c7-9.html Stevens (1962), p. 133]</ref>
''Pugilist'' itself was indecisive and failed to make a decisive breakthrough. It did, however, establish an alternative route of attack and thus laid the ground for ''Supercharge II'', an outflanking manoevre via the Tebaga Gap.

==Background==
After a failed attempt, at Medenine, to interfere with Allied preparations (Operation Capri), Axis forces had withdrawn to prepared defences at the Mareth Line. At the same time, Erwin Rommel returned permanently to Europe, command being assumed by Italian General Giovanni Messe, the first time that German units came under Italian command, albeit with a German "liaison" officer, Major-General Fritz Bayerlein. The command structure, however, was not unified. Italian orders were ignored and German units effectively set their own objectives, leaving Italian units to conform.<ref>[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Bard-c8-9.html#name-022229-1 Stevens (1962), p. 173]</ref>

There were also disagreements within the German command. Rommel doubted the efficacy of the Mareth Line and had long advocated a position at Gabès, between the sea and extensive, impassable salt marshes known as the Chotts. He had also argued that actions at Mareth and Gabès could only delay and Axis forces should concentrate much further north. Hitler disagreed until Rommel had returned to Germany and only accepted the arguments on March 10. Further disagreements from Albert Kesselring and the Italian high command impeded and finally reversed the decision and reinstated the Mareth position.

==Geography==
The local geography greatly influenced the course of both ''Pugilist'' and ''Supercharge II''; terrain suitable for military movement was limited. In southern Tunisia, the coastal plain is delimited by the Matmata Hills (or Monts des Ksour) which lie south to north. In the north, they terminate at the Tebaga Gap, a low pass which separates them from the Djebel Tebaga, another line of high ground running east-west: north and west of this are the Chotts. West of the Matmata Hills, the terrain is dry country, the Dahar, and then impassable sand of the Grand Erg Oriental. The town of Gabès lies on the coast where the coastal plain meets the route from the Tebaga Gap. North of Gabès, the road to Sfax passes between the sea and the Chotts and this was Montgomery's only route north.

The Axis defences of the Mareth Line took advantage of the terrain. Wadi Zigzaou is a natural anti-tank obstacle with steep banks rising up to 70 feet: the north-western side had been fortified by the French and subsequently reinforced. It crosses the coastal plain from Zarat to Toujane; in the Matmata Hills, the terrain alone was sufficient defence. In 1938, the French had determined that the Dahar was impassable to motorised transport and so had not extended the Mareth Line. By 1943, however, military transportation had improved. The British also had practical experience in desert mobility and so considered that the Dahar might offer an opportunity for outflanking the Mareth Line - the so-called "left hook". The Germans sought to defend it but Rommel had long advocated, albeit unsuccessfully, the Gabès gap as a better defensive alternative.

==The battle==
===First assault on the Mareth Line===
thumb|320px|right
On 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, with difficulty, penetrated the Italian held line near 15th Panzer Division's counter-attack on 22 March recaptured much of the bridgehead.

Soon after, XXX Corps prepared a new attack towards Tallouf. The 4th Indian Infantry Division was detailed to make a night attack on 23 March around the left-hand end of the Line. This would coincide with the wide "left hook" manoeuver Montgomery was planning.

===Preparations for the "left hook"===
In early January, 1943 a Long Range Desert Group patrol, commanded by Captain N. P. Wilder, had found a usable pass into the Dahar - dubbed "Wilder's Gap". A later patrol, commanded by Lt R. A. Tinker, had penetrated to the Tebaga Gap, proved the route was practicable and demonstrated the weakness of the Axis defences. Tinker's incursion went further north to Gafsa and made contact with the British First Army, advancing from the west, on 2 February.

Montgomery strengthened the Bernard Freyberg, into the New Zealand Corps and issued orders for it to move south through the X Corps were seconded to provide adequate HQ personnel for the new New Zealand Corps and this caused some inter-personal difficulties between the generals. 

The New Zealand Corps' advance was planned in three stages, from 19th March. First, a 20 mile overnight march to Wadi bel Krecheb; second, another overnight march of 40 miles to just short of the Tebaga Gap. The third stage was the capture of the entrance to the Gap at first light on 21st March, or as soon as possible. Thereafter, the corps would advance to El Hamma, overlooking the coast road north of Gabès. The flank of the advance was to be protected by LeClerc's Free French and the King's Dragoon Guards. An exploiting thrust by X Corps from El Hamma to Gedes would cut off the Italian 1st Army defending the Mareth positions and provide the New Zealand Corps with the opportunity to advance to Sfax, some 80 miles up the coast from Gedes, and the landing grounds on the west side of the town.

During planning, emphasis was laid on the need for surprise and the ability to "blitz" enemy positions. The Corps was relatively light with infantry, and great emphasis was laid on artillery to break enemy concentrations and morale. Extensive efforts were made to co-ordinate air support by fighter and bomber aircraft. A simultaneous frontal attack by XXX Corps on the Mareth Line would divide enemy attention and thereby make effective counter-attack difficult. In addition, British First Army's U.S. II Corps, advancing from the west through Battle of El Guettar would threaten enemy communications and pin potential Axis reinforcements from the Sfax area.

===Execution===
As planned, The New Zealand Corps engaged the enemy in the German 164th Light and 21st Panzer Divisions was very slow, although the entrance to the gap was secured. On the Mareth line XXX Corps too had made some progress but there had been no breakthrough there either. On 23 March Montgomery issued orders for X Corps' 1st Armoured Division to reinforce the New Zealand Corps from reserve (where it had been held to exploit the anticipated breakthrough either by XXX or NZ Corps during Pugilist) and for General Horrock's X Corps HQ to take overall control of the Allied forces operations in the Tebaga Gap.

L''''opération Pugilist''' était une opération des forces alliées de la Seconde Guerre mondiale qui s'inscrit dans la campagne de Tunisie.

Dans son plan initial, le général britannique 8 armée à la ligne Mareth, et d'avancer pour prendre Sfax »<ref> [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Bard-c7-9.html Major-General W.G. Stevens, « Bardia to Enfidaville », ''The Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–1945'', éd. Historical Publications Branch, Wellington, 1962, p. 133]</ref>.

Pugilist a été indécise et n'a pas permis de percée décisive. Elle a, toutefois, établi un itinéraire d'attaque alternatif et a donc jeté les bases de ''Supercharge II'', une manœuvre de contournement par l'intermédiaire du col de Tebaga.
