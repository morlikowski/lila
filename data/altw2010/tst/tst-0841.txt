'''Kennedy''' is a station on the Bloor-Danforth and Scarborough RT lines of the subway system; it is a terminus for each line, which depart in opposite directions. It is located at 2455 Kennedy Road. The station opened in Borough of Scarborough) with the Bloor-Danforth platform, and the Scarborough RT platform opened in Kennedy station on Stouffville railway line. Nearby landmarks include the Mid-Scarborough Community Centre.

Kennedy is a four-level station, with the Scarborough RT on top, then the bus terminal, the entry concourse that leads to the GO railway station and parking, and the subway on the bottom. The subway and RT tracks through the station are parallel. Leaving the station, the Scarborough RT line descends to ground level and turns north to run alongside the Canadian National Railway railway tracks. All TTC levels are accessible by elevator.

Although the Scarborough RT trains are bidirectional, at this station they originally reversed on a loop like single-ended streetcars, because when Kennedy station was built, the TTC planned to run the line as a dedicated right-of-way for streetcars, rather than the light metro that was eventually constructed. They would enter the station from the east, unload passengers, run onto an elevated loop west of the station to reverse, return to the station, and call at a second platform to load passengers before departing eastward.

The trains could not handle the sharp curves of the loop as well as expected, so the station was rebuilt in 1988 to eliminate it. Because of another curve at the east end of the station, it was not possible to add a scissors crossover there, so the station was reduced to a single terminal track. Trains now use that track to reverse; platforms on either side allow for trains to open their doors on both sides while stopped. The original loading platform on the south side of the tracks, extended to meet the single remaining track, is still the one primarily used for loading, and the other for unloading.

Kennedy is the fourth busiest station in the system, after Sheppard-Yonge, St. George, and Bloor-Yonge, serving a combined total of approximately 112,260 people a day.  Along with Lawrence West, Lansdowne, and Warden stations, this station has among the highest crime rates in the subway system.[http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/326389]

Kennedy is getting busier as the population growth in the Scarborough area increases. Statistics show that Kennedy is the third busiest station in the transit system but it is also one of its smaller stations. It has four floors including a basement level for subways, a lower-mid level for various underground walkway paths to and from significant locations around Kennedy Station, a ground level for buses and an above-ground level for the Scarborough RT. Therefore, the TTC and the municipality government of City of Toronto have bruited the possibility of expandng the station in order to meet the increasing demand. As bus service increases, the need for more bus bays will probably also rise.
