Reflections on '''longevity''' have usually gone beyond acknowledging the basic shortness of human life and have included thinking about methods to extend life. Longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community but also for writers of travel, science fiction and utopian novels. There are many difficulties in authenticating the longest human lifespan ever, due to inaccurate birth statistics; though fiction, legend, and mythology have proposed or claimed vastly longer lifespans in the past or future and longevity myths frequently allege them to exist in the present.

The word 'longevity' is sometimes used as a synonym for "life expectancy" in demography. However, this is not the most popular or accepted definition.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/longevity?cat=health. longevity: Definition and Much More from Answers.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For the general public as well as writers, the word generally connotes 'long life', especially when it concerns someone or something lasting longer than expected (an 'ancient tree', for example).

==History==

Longevity according to the psalms of the Bible was estimated on average to be "threescore and ten", that is 70 years, and "by reason of strength be extended to fourscore", that is 80 years.<ref>Holly Bible, King James Version, Psalm 90:10</ref>     In addition, Solon, the famous lawgiver of Ancient Greece, in his dialogue with Croesus stated 70 as the allotted length of life for man.  The longest living person as recorded in the Old Testament was Methuselah, who was said to have lived nearly a millenium.

There are many organizations dedicated to exploring the causes behind aging, ways to prevent aging, and ways to reverse aging. Despite the fact that it is human nature not to wish to surrender to old age and death, a few organizations are against antiaging because they believe it sacrifices the best interests of the new generation and/or that it is unnatural and/or unethical. Others are dedicated to it, seeing it as a form of transhumanism and the pursuit of immortality. Even among those who do not wish for eternal life, longevity may be desired to experience more of life or to provide a greater contribution to humanity.

A remarkable statement mentioned by Diogenes Laertius (c. 250) is the earliest (or at least one of the earliest) references about ''plausible'' centenarian longevity given by a scientist, the astronomer Hipparchus of Nicea (c.185—c.120 B.C.), who, according to the doxographer, '''''assured''''' that the philosopher Democritus of Abdera (c.470/460—c.370/360 B.C.) lived 109 years. All other accounts given by the ancients about the age of Democritus appear to, without giving any specific age, agree on the fact that the philosopher lived over 100 years. This is a possibility that turns out to be likely, given the fact that many ancient Greek philosophers are thought to have lived over the age of 90 (e.g.,  Xenophanes of Colophon, c.570/565—c.475/470 B.C., Pyrrho of Ellis, c.360—c.270 B.C.,  Eratosthenes of Cirene c.285—c.190 B.C., etc.) and because of the difference that the case of Democritus evidences from the case of, for example, Epimenides of Crete (VII, VI centuries B.C.), who is said to have lived 154, 157 or 290 years, as has been said about countless elders even during the last centuries as well as in the present time. These cases are are not verifiable by modern means.

==Present life expectancies around the world==
Various factors contribute to an individual's longevity.  Significant factors in life expectancy include CIA World Fact Book</ref>
*First World: . . . 77-83 years (e.g. Canada: 80.1 years, 2005 est)
*Third World:. . . 35-60 years (e.g. Mozambique: 40.3 years, 2005 est)

Population longevities can be seen as increasing due to increases in life expectancies around the world:<ref>CIA World Fact Book 2002</ref><ref name="ciawfb" />
*Spain:. . . . . 81.02 years in 2002, 82.31 years in 2005
*Australia: . . 80      years in 2002, 80.39 years in 2005
*Italy:. . . . . . 79.25 years in 2002, 79.68 years in 2005 
*France: . . . .79.05 years in 2002, 79.60 years in 2005
*Germany: . . 77.78 years in 2002, 78.65 years in 2005
*UK: . . . . . . 77.99 years in 2002, 78.4  years in 2005
*USA: . . . . .  77.4       years in 2002,   77.7  years in 2005

The current validated longevity records can be found in the list of supercentenarians. Notable individuals include:
*Jeanne Calment (1875-1997, 122 years and 164 days) — the oldest person in history whose age has been verified by modern documentation.  This defines the human lifespan, which is set by the oldest documented individual who ever lived.
*Shigechiyo Izumi (1865-1986, 120 years 237 days, disputed) — the oldest male ever recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records; this is widely questioned by scholars, who believe that conflation of dates has occurred and this has compromised the authenticity of Izumi's age.
*Christian Mortensen (1882-1998, 115 years 252 days) — the oldest male widely accepted by scholars.

== Exceptions: Populations from developing world with high life expectancy ==
Some populations have reputation <ref>"The Anti-Aging Plan: Strategies and Recipes for Extending Your Healthy Years" by Roy Walford (page 27)</ref> <ref>[The Okinawaprogram: Learn the secrets to healthy longevity by Willcox, Willcox and Suzuki (page 3)]</ref> <ref>Long lived populations: Extreme old age. J Am Geriatr Soc 30:485-87</ref>of producing unusual number of individuals with exceptionally high ages, for example:
* Okinawans,
* people from the mountains of Pakistan the Hunza,
* the inhabitants from the high mountain valley of Vilcabamba in South America,
* inhabitants of some regions in the Caucasus mountains.

==Religion==

The Bible contains many accounts of long-lived humans, the oldest being Methuselah living to be 969 years old (). Today some maintain that the unusually high longevity of Biblical patriarchs are the result of an error in translation: lunar cycles were mistaken for the solar ones, and that the actual ages being described would have been 12.4 times less (a lunar cycle being 29.5 days). This makes Methuselah's age only 78. This rationalization, however, seems doubtful too since patriarchs such as Mahalalel () and Enoch () were said to have become fathers after 65 "years". If the lunar cycle claim were accepted this would translate to an age of about 5 years and 3 months. 

One claim of Christian scholars  is that the life span of humans has changed; that originally man was to have everlasting life, but due to man's sin, God progressively shortened man's life in the "four falls of mankind" &mdash; first to less than 1000 years, then to under 500, 200, and eventually 120 years. After those long living people died around the time of the Biblical Flood, God decided that humans would not be permitted to live more than 120 years () However, since later biblical figures (and more recent people) such as Sarah lived for longer than that, 120 years should be considered the "usual" upper  limit to man's lifespan. Some individuals can live slightly longer than that. 

It has been hypothesized  that there is a trade-off between cancerous tumor suppression and tissue repair capacity, and that by lengthening telomeres we might slow aging and in exchange increase vulnerability to cancer (Weinstein and Ciszek, 2002). Experimentation with telomeres on worms has yielded increased worm life spans by about 20% (Joeng et al., 2004).
Even if further study shows that telomeres specifically are not tied to aging, the concept that some sort of DNA damage can cause genetically accelerated aging cannot be abandoned, thus providing a rational explanation for longevity and a subsequent reduction of longevity post-flood.

Many cultures like the Sumerians and Indus Valley also document groups of people who have lived for hundreds of years.

La '''longévité''' d'un être vivant est la durée de vie pour laquelle il est biologiquement programmé, dans des conditions idéales et en l'absence de maladie ou d'accident<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=QULx1ctg2VoC&pg=PT3&lpg=PT3&dq=dur%C3%A9e+de+vie+maximale&source=web&ots=EfpzRrZNxc&sig=ritiGICWBpTpeHkyniYgtRYej-E#PPT3,M1 Gériatrie, par Collectif, Laurence Aveline], Monographie, Collection : Modulo pratique, dirigé par Didier Mallay, Chapitre 1, page 13.</ref>. Elle correspond à la durée de vie maximale d'une espèce.

Il ne faut pas confondre cette notion avec l'espérance de vie, qui est la durée de vie moyenne des individus d'une espèce donnée. 

== Longévité humaine==

On situait autrefois la longévité humaine aux alentours de 100 ans, et il est effectivement probable que très peu de personnes aient réellement dépassé cet âge avant le . Depuis, le nombre de centenaires et même de supercentenaires (personnes âgées d'au moins 110 ans) n'a cessé d'augmenter. Le record de longévité humaine ''légalement prouvée'' (par des actes d'état civil), est à ce jour toujours détenu par la française Jeanne Calment, qui a atteint l'âge de 122 ans. 

De nombreux autres records existent mais ne repose pas sur des documents vérifiables. 
Ainsi un "almanach universel", de l'année 1825, édité par "Brée l'ainé, imprimeur du Roi", décrit la longévité remarquable d'un nommé Etienne Baqué, qui serait né à Angoumer (Ariège) le 16 Janvier 1700, et serait mort le 22 Août 1824 à Estadens (Haute-Garonne), âgé donc de 124 ans. Une de ses activités consistait à cueillir des plantes médicinales, dans les Pyrénées, qu'il revendait aux pharmaciens<ref>{{Ouvrage

Un certain nombre de scientifiques, comme par exemple le britannique Aubrey de Grey, promoteur du projet SENS, pensent que ce record pourra largement être dépassé par un effectif croissant d'individus en bonne santé, si l'on donne à la recherche les moyens nécessaires.
