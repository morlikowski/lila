'''Damon Gough''' (nicknamed '''Badly Drawn Boy'''), was  born indie singer-songwriter.

==Early life==
Damon Gough chose his stage name from the title character in the show ''Sam and his Magic Ball'', which he saw on TV at a party in clubs in Blackburn and Manchester.

A chance meeting with DJing, led to the foundation of single, ''EP1'', was pressed the following year to critical acclaim, although only 500 copies were made.

In ''Q'' magazine named Badly Drawn Boy in their list of the "50 Bands To See Before You Die", although this was as part of a sub-list of "5 Bands That Could Go Either Way" on account of Gough's tendency to talk and tell stories for extended periods rather than playing songs.

==Early career==
Gough's recording career began in September 1997 with the five track vinyl release "EP1". This was distributed among friends and family members. With only 500 being pressed, the record is now considered something of a Holy grail for Badly Drawn Boy enthusiasts, with copies commanding up to £100 on eBay.

In April 1998, Gough released his second EP, "EP2". This featured one track less than its predecessor but twice as many copies were pressed. The highlight track "I Love You All" was later transferred to a music box which was released alongside the EP. The box plays eleven seconds of the song and is considered much rarer than the record itself due to its limited production.

Gough’s third EP, "EP3", was released in November 1998 on both CD  and vinyl formats, and was the first release in what would become a long-term partnership with Videos were recorded for both tracks.

''It Came from the Ground'' was the next EP, released in March 1999 on CD and vinyl. The style of this recording focused on woodland environments, an aspect displayed in both the cover art and the title track's video. Also released during this period was the single "Whirlpool". An instrumental was released on vinyl in April 1999.

Gough's last EP, ''Once Around the Block'' was released in August 1999 in two vinyl formats and one CD edition. The release is almost short enough to be considered a single.

==Mainstream success==

Following the success of his early EPs, Gough's debut album, ''The Hour of Bewilderbeast'', was released in June 2000, accompanied by four singles (including a re-release of ''Once Around the Block'').

The album was critically acclaimed and Badly Drawn Boy was successful in winning the 2000 Mercury Music Prize, beating his contemporaries Doves to the £20,000 prize. The album sold well (300,000 copies) and is widely considered to be his defining work.

After a short break, Damon returned to score the film adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel ''About a Boy''. Impressed by his past work, the Weitz brothers asked Gough to score the film, a task which he undertook alone. Three singles from the album were released over the course of 2002.

His third album, ''Madonna and John Lennon. Another three singles and a long American tour accompanied the album.
