* Rachel ("Hellfire") Hotchkiss from Mark Twain's ''Hellfire Hotchkiss''<ref>''Hellfire Hotchkiss'', Mark Twain, in ''Satires and Burlesques'', University of California, 1967. The character's creator explicitly refers to her as a "tomboy," and this is echoed by the volume's editor. "Hellfire" Hotchkiss was introduced as a female counterpart to Oscar "Thug" Carpenter, whose gentleness makes him seem feminine by the standards of that time and place. Hellfire herself describes their difficulties in life as being due to their "misplaced sexes" (Everett H. Emerson, ''Mark Twain: A Literary Life'', pp. 231-232). See also Linda A. Morris, "The Eloquent Silence in 'Hellfire Hotchkiss", in ''The Mark Twain Annual 3 (2005), pp. 43–51.</ref>
