'''Nevermore''' är ett amerikanskt bas), 1995.

Anledningen till remixningen av ''Enemies of Reality'' (2003) var att Century Media snålade med budgeten till albumet, vilken innebar att Nevermore inte kunde anlita Andy Sneap, som producerat ''Dead Heart in a Dead World'', och de fick då leta lokalt efter en producent. Valet föll på före detta Queensrÿche-gitarristen Kelly Gray. Dock blev det ingen succé, då Gray egentligen var en popproducent. Efter tre månader i studion var skivan klar. Nevermore blev inte nöjda alls med produktionen, de tyckte skivan lät skit och definitivt inte som en Nevermore-platta. Då började de leta efter ett nytt kontrakt med ett nytt skivbolag. Då Century Media lade fram ett "sanslöst bra anbud", var villkoren att de skulle få mixa om skivan för att ens överväga ett nytt kontrakt med bolaget.

'''Nevermore''' is an American metal band from Sanctuary. The band incorporates elements from styles such as thrash, death, progressive and even acoustic guitars and a wide range of vocal styles. 

== Biography ==

Nevermore started in the beginning of the 1990s, when the band Sanctuary was pressured by its recording label to change its musical style, switching from heavy metal to Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Two members of the band—vocalist Warrel Dane and bassist Jim Sheppard—didn't agree with the change, and thus proceeded to create a project of their own: Nevermore.

By the end of 1994, the band assumed a stable line-up, which saw the additions of drummer Van Williams and former Sanctuary touring guitarist album through Death, both internationally-renowned bands.

Second guitarist Pat O'Brien joined the band prior to the release of the EP ''The Politics of Ecstasy'', both from 1996. O'Brien left Nevermore to play in Forbidden), who had previously contributed to Nevermore through songwriting, replaced O'Brien as Nevermore's guitarist.

Three years without releases followed, but in 1999, the album ''interpretation, emitting varied emotions from his vocals. The album's lyrics are a partially true retelling of the events Dane underwent after the vanishing of his long-time girlfriend.

A long tour with several concerts followed, and Nevermore played together with bands such as Arch Enemy, Annihilator) and Jag Panzer's Chris Broderick.

Nevermore proceeded to record ''Dead Heart in a Dead World'', which was followed by tours with several bands, most notably with Savatage in 2001.

The band's fifth album, ''Testament; Smyth was eventually added to the line-up on a permanent basis.

A sixth album, ''This Godless Endeavor'', was released in July of 2005. Nevermore then toured on Dave Mustaine's Gigantour during the summer of 2005. In 2006 they toured with Disturbed and also as direct support to In Flames on the second leg of its North American tour.

2006 held a bit of bad luck for Nevermore, as bassist Jim Sheppard underwent a procedure for type 2 diabetes, and the band was forced to cancel their show in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on May 13, 2006, due to an unspecified illness afflicting Dane.

On September 12, 2006, Nevermore was supposed to record its first full length DVD live at the Zeche club in Bochum, Germany. This event was to be captured by 7 cameras and the live recording was to be produced by Andy Sneap. However, according to Nevermore's official website, on the day of the show, Warrel Dane fell ill with an infection, eventually resulting in the necessity of seeing a doctor at a hospital in Dortmund, Germany. Doctors insisted that he be kept at the hospital and the show was canceled that evening. Apologetic to their fans, Nevermore agreed with the local venue to perform the show on October 11, 2006. The double DVD set will also include a Nevermore documentary, all of the band's promo videos and past recordings from their 11 year career. This DVD is expected to be released sometime in 2008. A new album is also being written.

On August 30, 2007, it was announced that Steve Smyth would no longer be a member of the band, citing personal and business reasons for the departure.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=79824 BLABBERMOUTH.NET - Guitarist STEVE SMYTH Parts Ways With NEVERMORE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He stated that he would also be touring with Danish metal band Hatesphere as they supported Behemoth and later Dimmu Borgir, and would also be working on the release of The Esseness Project, an all-instrumental progressive rock album.
