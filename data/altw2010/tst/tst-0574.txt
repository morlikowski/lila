In November 1961 Gonzalo and his brother Alfonso, concerned that their father was wasting away his money, applied to a French court for a decree of interdiction against their father; this would have meant that their father would have been legally considered a minor.<ref>"Trustee to Run Duke's Estate", ''The Times'' (January 25, 1962): 9.</ref>  They were supported in their application by their grandmother Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain as well as by other members of the Spanish Royal Family.  In January 1962 the court held that there were not sufficient grounds for an interdiction, but it did appoint a trustee for reasons of prodigality and extravagance.
