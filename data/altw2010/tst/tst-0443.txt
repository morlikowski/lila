'''''Inchon''''' is a 1982 film directed by Terence Young about the Battle of Incheon during the Korean War. 

The movie was panned by reviewers as overpriced and poorly-acted. Filmed over five years, ''Inchon'' lost an estimated 44.1 million USD. One of the major financial backers of Inchon was the extras, withdrew support for the movie.

A portion of the movie was filmed on the USS ''Cleveland''.  It was filmed during an amphibious operation off the coast of Korea in 1978. [http://www.history.navy.mil/shiphist/c/lpd-7/1978.pdf]

==Origin==
The story of how Sun Myung Moon became involved in movie-making is almost certainly apocryphal: One day, Sun Myung Moon began crying and could not stop. To raise his spirits he took a trip to the movie theatre and the crying stopped. He saw this as a sign from God and resolved to make his own motion picture. 

The reverend united with a Japanese businessman, Jesus of Nazareth'' had recently been well-received. But Sun Myung Moon had other ideas. He remembered the UN forces landing at Inchon, and how the mastermind behind the landings, General Douglas MacArthur, must have been inspired by God.

==Production==
From the start it was clear ''Inchon'' would not be a cheap enterprise. The cost was to be split more or less down the middle, with Matsusaburo Sakaguchi putting up half the money, and Sun Myung Moon covering the rest from his personal fortune. But neither could have foreseen the disasters that would eventually make it - for the time - one of the most expensive motion pictures ever made.

To shoot the movie they chose British director Terence Young, a veteran of three James Bond films and the successful adaptation of ''Wait Until Dark''. The lead role of General Douglas MacArthur was given to Laurence Olivier, at the time experiencing something of a renaissance as a movie star. Olivier was to be paid one million dollars for his work, but would eventually earn more as the film went over schedule. Ben Gazzara would receive $450,000 for a secondary role, and Toshiro Mifune, Richard Roundtree and David Janssen completed the primary cast.

Disasters that beset the production included:
*A typhoon that destroyed a recreation of the lighthouse at Inchon, requiring it to be rebuilt at huge cost.
*The beach landings at Inchon had to be redone after an assistant director accidentally sent the ships in the wrong direction, which ended up costing $2 million.
*The scene where General Douglas MacArthur greets the crowds in his limousine had to be shot three times. The first time, there were not enough people in the crowd. The second time, the shots did not match the first version. Finally, the producers hired a studio in Dublin especially for the scene at a total cost of $3 million.

==Reaction==
The film was eventually shown at Cannes in a 140 minute version that was virtually booed off the screen. The film was then re-edited to 105 minutes, losing all of Janssen's scenes. A massive publicity campaign was launched, to no avail. Aside from the atrocious reviews, audiences were afraid that the film was being used as part of a drive by the Unification Church to recruit new members. The New York Times said that ''Inchon'' "looks like the most expensive B-movie ever made." 

''Inchon'' (originally called ''Oh, Inchon'') would end up costing $40.8 million (Some estimates have put the figure between $65 million and $104 million, which would make it one of the biggest flops of all time). The film took just $5.2 million at the box office, and as it was not officially released on video or DVD (nor are there any plans to do so in the foreseeable future) it has a very small chance of recouping its massive budget.

Nel 1950 gli Stati Uniti, con un contingente che operava sotto il mandato delle Nazioni Unite e che comprendeva reparti di altri Paesi occidentali, fronteggiarono l'avanzata verso sud delle truppe nordcoreane. L'invasione era avallata dal tacito assenso di Unione Sovietica e Cina.

Il generale MacArthur dovette affrontare delle scelte
