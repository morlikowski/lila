'''Brook''' (ブルック, ''Burukku'') is a fictional character in the anime and manga series ''One Piece'', created and written by artist Eiichiro Oda. He is the eighth member to join the Straw Hat Pirates who serves as the musician of the crew. <!--This counts every member of the crew who has joined.  Luffy didn't join the crew - he created it, therefore, he isn't counted in the numbering! -->

==About Brook==

Brook is first introduced as a skeleton inhabiting the region of the Grand Line known as the Florian Triangle. He is a former member of the Rumba Pirates, a crew of musicians who sailed the Grand Line from West Blue over fifty years prior to the current time frame of the story<ref>''One Piece'' Manga - Chapter 487</ref>. They were followed by the whale Laboon, who took a particular liking to Brook's peculiar afro and his enchanting music. Promising to return after sailing the Grand Line, the crew left Laboon at the lighthouse at Reverse Mountain, stating that the Grand Line is too dangerous for such a small whale<ref>''One Piece'' Manga - Chapter 487</ref>. After entering the Florian Triangle, Brook's entire crew was slaughtered by an unknown pirate crew<ref>''One Piece'' Manga - Vol.46 - Chapter 443, Page 6, Panel 4</ref>. Because he ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, a Devil Fruit that allows the user to come back to life after dying, Brook's spirit returned to the Grand Line, however, he got lost due to the intense fog in the Florian Triangle. After wandering for some time, he finally found his body, which had decayed to nothing but bleached bones leaving only his afro (which remained due to strong roots)<ref>''One Piece'' Manga - Vol.46 - Chapter 443, Page 7</ref>. Brook was returned to life as a walking, talking skeleton. During the time he spent alone on his former crew's ship, he had almost no contact with other human beings, possibly leading to his eccentric behavior such as his perverted nature or over the top sense of humor (he has a constant urge to make bone jokes).  

Eight years before meeting the Straw Hat crew, he was captured by Gecko Moria, who stole his shadow and placed it in the body of the legendary samurai Ryuma<ref>''One Piece'' Manga - Vol.48 - Chapter 462</ref>. Because he could no longer be exposed to sunlight, a side effect of having no shadow in ''One Piece'', Brook remains in the Florian Triangle, under the protective cover of the thick fog, until he meets the Straw Hat Pirates.

His goal is to circle the Grand Line and return to Reverse Mountain, reuniting with the whale, Laboon, and fulfilling the promise the Rumba Pirates made. He carries a recording of the crew, whose last survivors played their cheery song "Bink's Sake" with their dying breaths.  He fears Laboon will not recognize him (being all bones now) without his afro, so he does all he can to protect it<ref>''One Piece'' Manga - Vol.47 - Chapter 459</ref>.

According to Eiichiro Oda, Brook most resembles a horse. He is identified by the colors black and white, and he smells of tea. 

Brook is currently the oldest Strawhat, being more than 50 years in difference to the second oldest, Franky. He is also the tallest Strawhat, excluding Chopper's Monster Point form.

Though Brook did not appear in the story until 2007, Oda planned to include a skeleton musician in One Piece ever since drawing the Laboon arc in 2000.<ref>http://manganohi.jp/2007/12/9419.html - Interview with Eiichiro Oda</ref>

Brook is known for his strange personality, being a combination of a gentlemanly persona and a perverted, crude sort.  He speaks in a dignified, educated manner at most times, but is known to have amazingly bad manners (burping and farting at dinner, casually asking to see womens' panties, picking at other peoples' food, etc).  This most likely comes from the fact that he spent several decades alone on his ship, giving him almost no experience with humans during that time.

Brook is also known to adore bone puns. He takes any chance he can to make a comment about his skeletal nature, almost inevitably following with "Yoho! Skull joke!!"  Example: "I was so shocked, my eyes nearly popped out of my head! BUT I HAVE NO EYES!!"

Brook has a distinct laugh, always known to give off a jolly "Yohoho!"

'''Brook''' (ブルック,''Burukku'') adalah karakter fiksi dalam komik dan anime One Piece. Dalam Kelompok Bajak Laut Topi Jerami, Brook berposisi sebagai musisi. Sebagaimana dengan tokoh-tokoh lain dalam manga One Piece, Brook memiliki tawa yang unik (Yohoho).

== Tentang Brook ==
Pada awalnya Brook adalah anggota kelompok bajak laut Rumbar yang berasal dari West Blue. Kelompok bajak laut Rumbar inilah yang membuat janji untuk bertemu kembali dengan paus Laboon di Reverse Mountain. Brook telah berkelana sebagai bajak laut puluhan tahun sebelum bertemu dengan kelompok bajak laut topi jerami. Penampilan dari Brook yang merupakan tengkorak, disebabkan oleh Brook memakan buah setan (Yomi-Yomi No Mi) yang menyebabkan dirinya dapat hidup kembali setelah mengalami kematian. Karena mati di daerah berkabut, Brook baru berhasil menemukan kembali tubuhnya setahun kemudian, dan tubuhnya sudah tinggal tulang belulang. 

Brook sebelum bertemu dengan kelompok bajak laut topi jerami, telah berkelana dalam area segitiga Florian yang disebabkan bayangan yang dimiliki diambil oleh Gecko Moria. Kemudian, setelah berkelana sendirian selama puluhan tahun dalam area segitiga Florian, Brook bertemu dengan kelompok bajak laut topi jerami. Bersama dengan kelompok bajak laut topi jerami, Brook mengalahkan Gecko Moria untuk merebut kembali bayangan-bayangan yang telah diambil.
