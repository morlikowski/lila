==Fictional character biography==
'''Leonard Samson''' was born in Hulk by siphoning off the gamma radiation that caused his transformations, Samson, who had been working with Banner/Hulk in his job as a psychiatrist, exposed himself to some of the siphoned radiation, granting him a superhumanly strong and muscular physique and causing his hair to turn green and to grow long, reminiscent of his biblical namesake. Initially, Samson's physical strength depends upon the length of his hair, though his gamma mutation eventually stablized making the length of his hair no longer a factor. Shortly afterward, his flirting with Betty Ross caused a jealous Banner to re-expose himself to radiation, becoming the Hulk once more to battle Samson.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #141</ref> He learned that his power decreases when he cuts his green hair,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #143</ref> but then lost his powers due to the bombardment of intense gamma radiation.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #147</ref> Feeling guilty about his role in his patient's return to being the Hulk, Samson would spend much time working with Banner over the years.

O '''Dr. Leonard Samson''' é um personagem das histórias em quadrinhos do Universo Marvel, publicadas pela Marvel Comics. É um talentoso psiquiatra que, após se expôr à radiação gama, acabou desenvolvendo super-poderes, como força e resistência aumentada. É um dos melhores amigos do Dr. Bruce Banner, o Incrível Hulk.

== Biografia do Personagem ==
O Psiquiatra Leonard Samson veio para o Exército dos EUA, que estava sobe o comando do General Ross, com um plano para curar a Betty Ross que tinha sido transformada em uma forma cristalina por uma transfusão de sangue com o criminoso Homem-Areia. Samson tinha as técnicas para inventar um projetor de raios de cathexis que drenaria as partículas energéticas de raios gama e a energia psíquica do Bruce Banner quando ele se transformasse no Hulk. Samson teorizou que seguindo esse processo, o Banner seria curado da instabilidade fisiológica que continuamente o transformava no Hulk. Esperando salvar Betty e ser curado, Banner participou da experiência. O raio de cathexis teve sucesso retrocedendo a Betty ao normal; porém, energias residuais drenadas do Banner permaneceram dentro do projetor. O Banner também estava curado. Mas Samson motivado por curiosidade científica, e provavelmente por um desejo para ganhar poderes sobre-humanos, se irradiou com as energias gama que estavam armazenadas no projetor. O resultado foi um "Sansão" da Marvel Comics, um psiquiatra musculoso, com longos cabelos verdes e com poderes sobre-humanos.

Já alterado, Samson começou a dar em cima da Betty Ross. Em um momento de ciúmes, Banner, que estava curado, foi até o projetor e se bombardeou novamente com radiação gama, voltando a ser o Hulk. Samson perdeu os poderes sobre-humanos depois de ser alvejado por uma explosão concentrada de radiação gama direcionada para o Hulk. Porém, meses depois o Samson recuperou os poderes sobre-humanos, quando ele foi bombardeado através de intensa radiação gama de um gerador que havia explodido. Durante os anos, o Dr. Samson, tentou capturar o Hulk e curar Banner. Durante a posse dele como professor universitário, ele foi chamado para fazer parte dos  Vingadores da Costa Oeste, porém recusou a oferta.

Samson, após prender o Hulk, o dividiu em duas entidades diferentes, o Hulk e Banner. Hulk, separado de Banner, começou uma destruição global. Sentindo-se responsável pela destruição que este novo Hulk estava causando, Samson tentou recaptura-lo. Tempos depois, o Samson pôde tratar o Hulk mais uma vez, com a ajuda do Mestre do Picadeiro, líder do Circo do Crime, e os poderes hipnóticos dele. Samson teve sucesso fundindo as três personalidades separadas do Hulk em apenas um Hulk.
