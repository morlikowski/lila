'''ピレネー山脈'''（アンドラ公国がある。

フランス側にはパイスバスコをピレネーは走る。

西部は1000m級のなだらかな山地だが、中央部から2000m級の山が増え、いくつものスキー場が広がる。アンドラ国境から西に100kmの付近が最も急峻。最高峰であるアネト山(標高3404m)がそびえ、3000m級の峰が10峰以上散在する。アンドラ国境を過ぎ、地中海岸から50kmの位置までは2000m峰が残る。東端は西端とは異なり、海岸まで山脈が迫っている。

「ピレネーを越えるとそこはアフリカだった」という言葉があるように8世紀から11世紀にかけて、イスラム教徒の侵入を阻む防壁としても働いた。

ルルドの泉で有名な巡礼地ルルドは山脈の分水嶺から50kmほど北の谷間に位置する町である。

また、月面にはこの山脈にちなんだピレネー山脈という地名がある。静かの海の南に延び、肉眼でも確認できる。

The '''Pyrenees''' (Spanish: ''Pirineos''; French: ''Pyrénées''; Catalan: ''Pirineus''; Occitan: ''Pirenèus''; Aragonese: ''Perinés''; Basque: ''Pirinioak'') are a range of mountains in southwest Europe that form a natural border between France and Spain. They separate the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of continental Europe, and extend for about  from the Bay of Biscay (Cap Higuer) to the Mediterranean Sea (Cap de Creus).

For the most part, the main crest forms a massive frontier, with the country  Catalonia and the  Basque Country are the only two territories extending on both sides of the mountain range, with a northern and a southern part on each side.

According to the Pyrene (''fire'' in Greek)  the daughter of Bebryx who was raped by Herakles. Terrified at giving birth to a serpent, she fled to the mountains and was either buried or eaten by wild animals. Herodotus located this legend in his map of the Oikumene as early as 450 BC. 

==Geography==

Politically, the provinces, from east to west: Girona, Barcelona, Lleida, Huesca, Navarra, and Guipúzcoa.

The départements'', from east to west: Pyrénées-Orientales, Aude, Ariège, Haute-Garonne, Hautes-Pyrénées, and Pyrénées-Atlantiques (the latter two of which include Pyrenees National Park). 

The independent principality of Andorra is sandwiched between the Spanish Pyrenees and French Pyrenees

Physiograpically, the Pyrenees are typically divided into three sections: the Central, the Atlantic or Western, and the Eastern. Together, they form a distinct physiographic province of the larger Alpine System division.

The Central Pyrenees extend eastward from the Somport pass to the Val d'Aran, and include the highest summits of the range:
* Pico d'Aneto or ''Pic de Néthou''  in the Maladeta ridge, 
* Posets peak , 
* Mont Perdu or ''Monte Perdido'' or ''Mont Perdut'' .

In the Atlantic Pyrenees the average elevation gradually decreases from east to west, until they merge with the Basque mountains near the Bay of Biscay. In the Eastern Pyrenees, with the exception of one break at the eastern extremity of the Pyrénées Ariégeoises, the mean elevation is maintained with remarkable uniformity until a sudden decline occurs in the portion of the chain known as the Albères.

==Geology==
The Pyrenees are older than the fanned out, pushing present-day Spain against France and putting large layers of sediment in a vise grip. The intense pressure and uplifting of the Earth's crust first affected the eastern part and stretched progressively to the entire chain, culminating in the Eocene epoch.

The eastern part of the Pyrenees consists largely of glacial development.

==Landscape==
thumb|250px|left|San Maurici lake in the [[Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park]]
Conspicuous features of Pyrenean scenery are:
* the absence of great lakes, such as those that fill the lateral valleys of the Alps
* the rarity and great elevation of passes
* the large number of the mountain torrents locally called ''gaves'', which often form lofty waterfalls, surpassed in Europe only by those of Scandinavia
* the frequency with which the upper end of a valley assumes the form of a semicircle of precipitous cliffs, called a cirque.

The highest Gavarnie (462&nbsp;m or 1,515&nbsp;ft), at the head of the Têt and the valley of the Segre, and the Col de Somport or Port de Canfranc, on the old Roman road from Saragossa to Oloron-Sainte-Marie.

A particularly notable feature is La Brèche de Roland, a gap in the ridge line, in tradition created by Roland.

==Natural resources==
thumb|250px|A waterfall in the Spanish Pyrenees
The metallic ores of the Pyrenees are not in general of much importance, though there were considerable iron mines at Vie de Sos in Ariège and at the foot of Canigou in Pyrénées-Orientales. Coal deposits capable of being profitably worked are situated chiefly on the Spanish slopes but the French side has numerous beds of lignite. The open pit of Trimoun (Ariège) is one of the greatest sources of talc in Europe.

sulphurous and mostly situated high, near the contact of the granite with the stratified rocks. The lower springs, such as those of Bagnères-de-Bigorre (Hautes-Pyrénées), Rennes-les-Bains (Aude) and Campagne (Aude), are mostly selenitic and not very warm.

==Climate==
The amount of the precipitation, including rain and snow, is much greater in the western than in the eastern Pyrenees, which leads to a marked contrast between these sections of the chain in more than one respect. In the first place, the eastern Pyrenees are without glaciers, the quantity of snow falling there being insufficient to lead to their development. The glaciers are confined to the northern slopes of the central Pyrenees, and do not descend, like those of the Alps, far down in the valleys, but have their greatest length in the direction of the mountain chain. They form, in fact, a narrow zone near the crest of the highest mountains. Here, as in the other great mountain ranges of central Europe, there are evidences of a much wider extension of the glaciers during the Ice age. The case of the glacier in the valley of Argelbs in the ''département'' of Hautes-Pyrénées is the best-known instance. The snow-line varies in different parts of the Pyrenees from 2,700 to 2,800 meters above sea-level.

==Flora and fauna ==
thumb|250px|right|A mountain stream
A still more marked effect of the preponderance of rainfall in the western half of the chain is seen in the vegetation. The lower mountains in the extreme west are wooded, but the extent of forest declines eastwards, and the eastern Pyrenees are peculiarly wild and barren, all the more since it is in this part of the chain that granitic masses prevail. There is a change, moreover, in the composition of the flora in passing from west to east. In the west the flora resembles that of central Europe, while in the east it is distinctly Mediterranean in character, though the difference of latitude is only about 1°, on both sides of the chain from the centre whence the Corbières stretch north-eastwards towards the central plateau of France. The Pyrenees are relatively as rich in endemic species as the Alps, and among the most remarkable instances of that endemism is the occurrence of the monotypic genus ''Xatardia'' (family Apiaceae), only on a high alpine pass between the Val d'Eynes and Catalonia. The genus most abundantly represented in the range is that of the saxifrages, several species of which are endemic here.

In their fauna also the Pyrenees present some striking instances of endemism. The Pyrenean Desman is found only in some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains, the only other member of this genus being confined to the rivers of the Caucasus in southern Russia. The Pyrenean euprocte (''Euproctus pyrenaicus''), an endemic relative of the salamander, also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among the other peculiarities of the Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the caverns of Ariège, the principal genera of which are ''Anophthalmus'' and ''Adelops''. The Pyrenean Ibex mysteriously became extinct in January of 2000; the native Pyrenean Brown Bear was hunted to near-extinction in the 1990s but was re-introduced in 1996 when 3 bears were brought from Slovenia. The population has bred successfully and there are now believed to be about 15 brown bears in the central region around Fos, only 4 native ones are still living in Aspe valley.

==Demographics and culture==
The ethnology, Basque Country; Béarn; Catalonia; Navarre; Roussillon. For their history, see also Almogavars, Marca Hispanica.

Languages spoken in the area are, notably,  Spanish, French and Catalan (in Occitan (Aragonese and Basque.

==Sport and leisure==
Both sides of the Pyrenees are popular spots for winter sports such as alpine skiing and mountaineering.

''Pyrena'' is a mushing competition held in the Pyrenees.

In the summer and autumn, the Pyrenees are featured in two of cycling's grand tours, the La Vuelta a España held in September. The stages held in the Pyrenees are often the defining moments of both tours, drawing hundreds of thousands of spectators to the region.

Three main GR10 across the northern slopes, the GR11 across the southern slopes, and the HRP  which traverses peaks and ridges along a high altitude route. In addition, there are countless marked and unmarked trails throughout the region.
