'''In My Darkest Hour''' () is a song on James nor Lars informed him of Cliff's accident and he only found out when the band's manager called him. When he heard the news, Dave sat down and cried and then grabbed an acoustic guitar. In one sitting, he wrote the entire song, which is the only song he has ever written in such a way. The lyrics are actually about an ex of his, while the music was inspired by Burton's passing. 

The song was released as a single and reached #26 on the UK charts, but it did not chart in the US. The Decline of Western Civilization II: The Metal Years'' and has since aired on music channels. It features stage performance as well as Mustaine's recording of vocals in the studio.

== Lyrics ==

In my hour of need,
Ha, no, you're not there
And though I reached out for you,
Wouldn't lend a hand

Through the darkest hour,
Your grace did not shine on me
Feels so cold, very cold,
No one cares for me

Did you ever think I get lonely?
Did you ever think that I needed love?
Did you ever think, stop thinking
You're the only one that I'm thinking of?

# In My Darkest Hour    •06:26•      (''Dave Mustaine / David Ellefson'')

* Dave Mustaine a écrit la chanson en une seule séance juste après avoir appris la mort de Cliff Burton. D'après Dave, ni James ni Lars ne l'auraient informé de la mort de Cliff. Quand il a appris la nouvelle, Dave s'est assis et a pleuré puis a pris une guitare acoustique et a commencé à composer...
