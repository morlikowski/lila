'''Svaneti''' or '''Svanetia''' ('''Suania''' in ancient sources) () is a historic province in Georgia, in the northwestern part of the country. It is inhabited by the Svans, an ethnic subgroup of the Georgians. 

== Geography ==
thumb|250px|The historic region of Upper Svaneti in Georgia.
Surrounded by 3,000–5,000 meter peaks, Svanetia is the highest inhabited area in Caucasus are located in the region. The highest mountain in Georgia, Mount Shkhara at 5,201 meters (17,059 feet), is located in the province.  Other prominent peaks include Tetnuldi (4,974m./16,319ft.), Shota Rustaveli (4,960m./16,273ft.), Mt. Ushba (4,710m./15,453ft.), and Ailama (4,525m./14,842ft.). 

Situated on the southern slopes of the central Greater Caucasus, Svanetia extends over the upper valleys of the Rioni, Kodori Gorge in the adjoining rebel province of Kuban and Baksan of Russia.

===Landscape===

The landscape of Svanetia is dominated by mountains that are separated by deep gorges.  Most of the region which lies below 1,800 meters (5,904ft.) above sea level is covered by mixed and fir, beech, pine and box.  The zone which extends from 1,800 meters to roughly about 3,000 meters (5,904–9,840ft.) above sea level consists of alpine meadows and grasslands.  Eternal snows and glaciers take over in areas that are over 3,000 meters above sea level.  The region is notable for its glaciers and picturesque summits.  Svanetia's signature peak is probably Mt. Ushba which towers over the Inguri Gorge and can be seen from many parts of the region.

===Climate===
The climate of Svanetia is humid and is influenced by the air masses coming in from the Black Sea throughout the year.  Average temperatures and precipitation vary considerably with elevation. Annual precipitation ranges between 1000 and 3200mm (39 and 126 inches). The highest amount of precipitation falls on the Greater Caucasus Mountains. The region is characterized by very heavy snowfall in the winter and avalanches are a frequent occurrence. Snow cover may reach 5 meters (16.4 feet) in some areas. In general, the lowest regions of Svanetia (800–1200 meters/2624–3936 feet above sea level) are characterized by long, warm summers and relatively cold and snowy winters.  Middle altitudes (1200-1800 meters above sea level) experience relatively warm summers and cold winters.  Areas above 2000 meters above sea level lie within a zone that experiences short, cool summers (less than 3 months) and long and cold winters.  Large parts of Svanetia lie above 3000 meters (9840 feet) above sea level, a zone which does not have a real summer.  Due to Svanetia's close proximity to the Black Sea, the region is spared from the extremely cold winter temperatures that are characteristic of high mountains.

== History ==

The Svans are usually identified with the ''Soanes'' mentioned by Greek geographer AD 552, when the Svans took advantage of the Persians. The Byzantines wanted the region, for if they secured its passes, they could prevent Persian raids on the border areas of Lazica. With the end of the war (562), Svanetia again became part of Lazica. Then, the province joined the Georgia in the early 11th century. Svanetia became a duchy (''saeristavo'') within it, governed by a duke (''eristavi''). The province’s Orthodox culture flourished particularly during the Georgian “golden age” under Queen Tamar (r. 1184-1213), who was respected almost as goddess by the Svanetians. The legend has it that the duchy was annually visited by Tamar. The Svans had been known as fierce warriors for centuries. Their inflatable war banner was named ''Lemi'' (Lion) because of its shape. 

The marauding Mongols never reached Svanetia and, for a time, the region became a cultural safe house. Following the final disintegration of the Kingdom of Georgia in the principality, while Lower Svanetia was gradually subdued by the Mingrelian princes. Facing serious internal conflict, Prince Tsioq’ Dadeshkeliani of Svanetia signed a treaty of protectorate with the Russian Empire on November 26, 1833. Difficult to access, the region retained significant autonomy until 1857, when Russia took advantage of the dynastic feud in Svanetia and effectively abolished the principality’s autonomy. In 1875, the Russians toughened their rule by imposing additional taxes. Protests ensued, and Russia deployed troops against the province. Despite having suffered heavy losses, the Russian army units eventually crushed the rebels burning their stronghold Khalde to the ground in 1876. 

Part of the Russian governorate of Kutais, Svanetia was divided into two Soviet rule. The unsuccessful anti-Soviet Svanetian Uprising took place in the region in 1921.

In 1987, avalanches destroyed several homes and killed seventy, mostly school children. Collapse of the Soviet Union, and subsequent Georgian Civil War created severe socioeconomic problems in the region. While the Svanetian population resisted the unpleasant conditions of the high mountain environment they lived in for centuries, the increasing economic difficulties of the last two decades and frequent natural disasters – floods and landslides as of April 2005 ([http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/26/georgia.floods.ap]) have brought about a strong tendency towards migration. The province became a safe haven for criminals threatening local residents and tourists. Large-scale anti-criminal operations carried out by the Georgian Special Forces as of March 2004 ([http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=6513]) resulted in significant improvement of the situation.

== Population ==
The Svans, the indigenous population of Svanetia, are ethnic subgroup of the Mingrelians and Svans had their own census grouping, but were classified under the broader category of Georgian thereafter. They are Georgian Orthodox Christians, and were Christianized in the 4th-6th centuries. However, some remnants of old paganism have been maintained. Saint George (known as ''Jgëræg'' to the locals), a patron saint of Georgia, is the most respected saint. The Svans have retained many of their old traditions, including blood revenge. Their families are small, and the husband is the head of his family. The Svan really respect the older women in families.

Верхняя '''Сванетия''' () находится в центральной части Главного Кавказского хребта, в северо-западной части Грузии между 42°48' и 43°15' сев. широты и между 59°30' и 61°00' вост. долготы и занимает площадь 3154 кв. км. С севера и востока ее окаймляет Гл. Кавказский хребет, с юга—Сванский. Сванский хребет примыкает непосредственно к Гл. Кавказскому хребту и этим замыкает Верхнюю Сванетию с востока. С запада район отделен хребтом Хурум. Вся Верхняя Сванетия расположена в верховьях бассейна реки Ингури.

Сохранившийся благодаря долгой изолированности этот район Кавказа — исключительный пример горного пейзажа с деревнями средневекового типа и домами-башнями. В деревнях Верхней Сванетии сохранилось большое количество этих весьма оригинальных домов, которые использовались одновременно как жильё и как защитные посты против захватчиков, наводнявших регион.
