"'''Where'd You Go'''" is the fourth single from Fort Minor's debut album ''The Rising Tied''. Released in 2006, the song features Holly Brook and Jonah Matranga. The song is about the perspective of the person left behind in long-distance relationships, but mainly about the consequences of putting one's career before one's family.

==Music Video==
The music video for "Where'd You Go" features interviews with a boy named Joey Leba, who has divorced parents, the wife of a baseball player Jon Garland caring for their children, and the parents of a soldier killed in Iraq. At the end of the video, a brief note states:
''"'Where'd You Go' was filmed in the homes of three families who share the same sense of loneliness as this song. Thank you for sharing your homes and stories with us. &mdash; Mike Shinoda, Fort Minor"''.

==MTV contest==
In June through July of 2006, MTV's Overdrive hosted a contest, where US residents of 18 years or older, could remix the video, using the censored version of the track, could submit the video, in hopes of winning prizes from Mike Shinoda and MTV.

On July 31, 2006, the winner was announced. The winning video was directed by David Ly, a graduate film student at Art Center College of Design, coincidentally Mike Shinoda's alma mater. His remake version of the video is about a person who lost touch with himself. He is full of life until he becomes a robot working a monotonous office job. One morning, he wakes up from a dream of a beautiful girl dressed in white on the beach. He leaves for work, and his buried alter egos emerge mysteriously. They are all dressed in white dress shirts, black slacks, and an assortment of colored ties and each holding a red and white rose. At work, his boss gives him a stack of paperwork, which he does mechanically. Meanwhile, at home, the alter egos are in a circle around his coffee table, throw the roses in the center, and leave. Back at work, he prepares to go home but is then given another stack of documents. His frustrations boil over, and he throws his tie at his boss. He runs home not knowing what he is running for, and at the moment that he walks in the door, the last of the alter egos exits. He finds a white box that replaced his coffee table and is intrigued. He unwraps the red and white ribbons and opens the box to find himself on the beach with the same girl in his dream and the roses on the water.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?type=1148&id=1537367&vid=97661 David Ly's video remake at MTV.com]</ref>

The entire song is performed in American Sign Language with some subtitles, and can be viewed on their [http://www.d-pan.com/ website].
