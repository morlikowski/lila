'''''Tales of the Jedi''''' is a series of comic books that are published by Expanded Universe. They cover the Great Sith War and the Great Hyperspace War and remain the earliest chronological Star Wars sources.

==Summary==
The Republic hyperspace explorers accidentally crash-landed on the Naga Sadow, provoked war with the Republic, and installed himself as the leader of the Massassi warriors.

Six hundred years later, fallen king.  His spirit continued to advise his descendants.

Another Jedi, Ulic Qel-Droma, was sent to Onderon to mediate a conflict, where he met the spirit of Freedon Nadd, who told him he would become a Sith Lord.  The prophecy came true when the Krath, a secret dark side society, attacked the Republic and injured Ulic with alchemically-treated shrapnel, and then injected him with dark side poisons that would ensure his fall.

Exar Kun left his master, Vodo-Siosk Baas, because his master would not let him learn about the dark side.  He went to Onderon, where he learned of Freedon Nadd's tomb.  Nadd's spirit told him to go to Korriban, where Nadd tricked him into accepting the dark side.  They went to Yavin IV, where Nadd gave him a choice: surrender to the dark side, or die.  Kun chose life.  After learning about the dark side from Nadd, Kun destroyed him with a dark side amulet.

Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma met on Cinnagar, and their battle was interrupted by the spirit of Marka Ragnos, who declared Kun the Dark Lord of the Sith, and Qel-Droma his apprentice.  Together, they waged war on the Republic, stealing Jedi students from Ossus and subverting them to the dark side.  Qel-Droma defeated Lord Mandalore, earning the services of the Mandalorian warriors.  Qel-Droma attacked Coruscant, but was captured.  Kun led a rescue attempt, and killed his former master in the process.  Soon thereafter, the Sith Lords caused the Cron Cluster to go supernova, destroying countless Jedi artifacts on nearby Ossus.

Before Ossus was destroyed, Ulic's brother Cay tried to convince him to return to the light.  Ulic cut him down in a Nomi Sunrider, when she forever cut off his connection to the Force.  Broken, Ulic surrendered to the Republic, and led them to Yavin IV, where Exar Kun committed a ritual that sapped the life from every Massassi on the planet to separate his spirit from his body and bind it to his temple.
