Mit '''Freecycle'''™ (von engl. ''free'' - kostenlos und ''cycle'' - Kreislauf, im Sinne von Recycling) bezeichnet man eine neue Art des Verschenkens von Gegenständen durch ein internetbasiertes Netzwerk. Funktionsfähige, aber nicht mehr benutzte Dinge sollen wieder einer sinnvollen Nutzung zugeführt werden. Über lokale Internetgruppen treffen sich Interessenten und verschenken Gegenstände oder suchen gezielt nach Sachen, die andere zu verschenken haben.

Das Verschenk-Netzwerk „Freecycle“ war eine Idee des Amerikaners Deron Beal, um Abfall zu reduzieren und der Überflussgesellschaft entgegenzutreten. Seit 2003 ist Freecycle stark gewachsen und erreicht inzwischen in 50 Ländern über zwei Millionen Mitglieder in etwa 2.000 lokalen Freecycle-Gruppen (Stand April 2006). Die etwa 70 Gruppen in Deutschland wurden von Thomas Pradel seit März 2004 gegründet.

Nach einer unkomplizierten Anmeldung kann jedes Gruppenmitglied Gegenstände, Möbel, usw. kostenlos mit einer Kurzbeschreibung anbieten. Bei erfolgreicher Kontaktaufnahme zwischen Interessenten und Anbietern, z.&nbsp;B. per E-Mail, wird die Abholung bzw. Übergabe organisiert.

Davon abzugrenzen ist der sogenannte Umsonstladen bei dem Waren physisch als Geschenk 
abgeliefert werden ohne dass man im Regelfall den Empfänger kennt.

''' The Freecycle Network''' (often abbreviated '''TFN''' or just known as '''Freecycle''') is a non-profit organization registered in the state of Arizona, USA, and separately registered as a UK charity,<ref>"Freecycle UK" is registered under charity number [http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?remchar=&chyno=1118148 1118148] and its registration refers to [http://uk.freecycle.org uk.freecycle.org] as its official website address.</ref> that organizes a worldwide network of "gifting" groups, aiming to divert reusable goods from landfill. It provides a worldwide online registry, and coordinates the creation of local groups and forums for individuals and non-profits to offer and receive free items for reuse or recycling, promoting gift economics as a motivating cultural outlook.  "Changing the world one gift at a time" is The Freecycle Network's official tagline.

== Background ==
The organization originated as a project of RISE Inc., a nonprofit corporation, to promote waste reduction in Tucson, Arizona. RISE subsequently handed it over to the project leader, Deron Beal. Beal set up the first Freecycle e-mail group for the citizens of Tucson. The concept has since spread to over 50 countries, with thousands of local groups and millions of members.

Each local group currently exists as a Yahoo! Groups mailing list run by volunteer moderators. TFN encourages the formation of new groups, subject to approval by regional New Group Approvers (NGAs). Groups approved by TFN are listed at the official website, can use the name and logo, and are subject to rules enforced by a structure of global and regional GOAs (Group Outreach Assistance). TFN originally planned to move a custom designed, centralized site in 2004, but the project moved slowly, largely because of a shortage of skilled volunteer labor. In 2008, Freecycle went live with a beta version of a centralized, custom site.

== Successes ==

TFN has grown rapidly into a global organization of over 3800 (October 2006) local chapters [http://www.freecycle.org/groups/], and passed the 2 million member mark in February 2006 [http://freecycle.org/pressreleases/06-02-21_2millionMembers.pdf]. As of March 22, 2008, the membership stands at 4,702,000 across 4,296 communities. The original idea has since been copied and varied by hundreds of similar groups around the world.

== Controversies ==

=== Corporate sponsorship ===
In February 2005, Deron Beal accepted TFN's first corporate support of $130,000 from Waste Management, Inc.<ref></ref> This polarized opinion amongst group moderators. Some saw it as a sensible way of raising funds from a company Beal describes as America's "largest recycler", but others saw it as selling out to corporate interests. Further criticism was provoked by a decision to take paid Google ads on the TFN web site, contrary to the initial stated principles, and by Beal's green ambassador role for WMI.<ref>

</ref> A second grant from Waste Management was received by TFN in February 2006 in the amount of $100,000, bringing total funding to $230,000 from WMI.

=== Management structure ===
Further criticism has focused on the close-knit friends-and-family board structure, which delayed full registration as a non-profit. Although set to a nominal limit of 15, to date it has been limited to founder Deron Beal (chairperson and treasurer), his wife Jennifer Columbus (vice chairperson) and friend Jolie Sibert (secretary), prompting accusations of nepotism. Beal defends this as a necessary interim measure whilst the organization grows rapidly.

=== Trademark ===
Beal has been criticized for vigorously defending TFN's generic term. A formal trademark opposition<ref></ref> was filed in January 2006. FreecycleSunnyvale filed a lawsuit in federal court against The Freecycle Network<ref></ref> in January 2006. An injunction was granted against Sunnyvale Free's group moderator Tim Oey in May 2006 for allegedly disparaging the TFN trademark.<ref></ref> This injunction was stayed in July 2006 and was eventually dissolved by the Ninth Circuit in September 2007.[http://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/circs/9th/0616219p.pdf] During 2006, in order to defend their trademark TFN also pursued other free recycling groups who either mentioned the term "freecycle" or allegedly had "confusingly similar derivations thereof",[http://www.chillingeffects.org/trademark/notice.cgi?NoticeID=5022] and made similar threats to a UK community arts festival in 2007.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/nov/07/guardiansocietysupplement]

The term "freecycle" is speculated to have first been used by David Hoekstra[http://www.homeenvy.com/artisans/hoekstra/hoekstra.htm] "Salvager Dali" in Toronto. The concept and term "FreeCycle" were used and trademark asserted by Hemp Online Inc in 2000.
