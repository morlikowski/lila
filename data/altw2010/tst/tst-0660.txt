"Mr. Pine" is the only released Renaissance track in which members of the original lineup (Hawken, Jane Relf) are heard together with a member of the classic lineup (Dunford).  It includes a theme that was later used in the far better-known Renaissance song "Running Hard"<ref>"Running Hard" is probably based on Jehan Alain's "Litanies".</ref> (from ''Turn Of The Cards'', 1974).

In order to complete the album, the (already disbanded) original lineup got back together—minus Hawken and plus guest keyboardist Don Shin—to record "Past Orbits Of Dust".<ref name="renhist" />

One track recorded during the ''Illusion'' sessions, a fairly short song called "Statues", was not used on the album.  It was eventually released in 2002 on the album ''Live + Direct''.<ref>Liner notes from ''Live + Direct''.</ref>

''Illusion'' is notable for being the first Renaissance album to feature lyrics by Betty Thatcher, who would work with the band throughout its entire "classic" period (1972-79) and beyond.  Thatcher was brought to the band by her friend Jane Relf.<ref name="renhist" />
