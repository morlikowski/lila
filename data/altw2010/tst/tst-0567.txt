Marschall '''Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr''' () (* Premierminister (bis zur Präsident des Revolutionären Kommandorates und damit auch des Irak bis zu seinem Rücktritt am 16. Juli 1979. Er war Mitglied der Baʿth-Partei, die 1963–2003 vorherrschende Partei in Irak war. 

Zu seinen größten Verdiensten als Präsident zählen die Errichtung der Kurdischen Autonomen Region (1970/74), die Schaffung der Nationalen Front mit Iraks Kommunisten und Barzanis Kurden (1972–1978), die Nationalisierung der Ölindustrie (1972/73), der Abschluss eines Freundschaftspaktes mit der Oktoberkrieg 1973, die Damaskus vor dem Fall bewahrte, gelang die 1978 geplante Aussöhnung und Vereinigung mit dem baathistischen Rivalen Syrien nicht. Zur Zeit al-Bakrs gab es im Irak einen gewaltigen Wirtschaftsboom, der die Macht der Baath-Partei weiter festigte.

1979 ernannte Präsident Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, inzwischen kränkelnd und mit 65 Jahren pensionsreif, Krieg gegen den Iran.

Dennoch war auch danach Saddam Husseins Autorität noch nicht völlig unumschränkt. Zunächst hatten al-Bakr und Saddam Hussein die Ämter nur getauscht, al-Bakr blieb faktisch Vizepräsident bis zu seinem Tode im Oktober 1982. Gerüchte wissen um eine vermeintliche Vergiftung just in dem Moment, als Saddam-kritische Baathisten über eine Rückberufung Bakrs sinnierten.

General '''Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr''' (Arabic '''أحمد حسن البكر''' '''') (July 1, 1914 – October 4, 1982), was President of Iraq from 1968 to 1979.

==Military career==
Al-Bakr entered the Iraqi Military Academy in 1938 after spending six years as a primary-school teacher. During his early military career, he took part in the Rashid Ali revolt in 1941, was arrested, imprisoned, and compulsorily retired from the army, but was reinstated in 1957. 

As a brigadier general, he was one of the "free officers," a group that overthrew the monarchy in 1958. He was again forced to retire from the Army in 1959 under allegations that he led a rebellion in Mosul by officers who favoured closer ties with the United Arab Republic.

A leading member of the coup that overthrew Iraq's military leader Abdul Karim Kasim. He became Prime Minister and Vice President but left the government in November 1963 - after ten months - when Field Marshal Abdul Salam Arif staged a countercoup. He remained Vice President until he was removed in January 1964.

Al-Bakr retained control of the regional command of the Ba'th Party and in 1968, with Egyptian help, he orchestrated an internal coup within the government of President Abdul Rahman Arif. Arif was exiled and al-Bakr installed as president.

== President of the Republic (July 1968 &ndash; July 1979) ==

Al-Bakr became the leading face of the Ba'ath party and Iraqi pan-Arabism and was praised as "leader of the revolution."

He quickly nationalized the Iraq Petroleum Company and compensated all foreign oil companies operating within its borders while introducing wide-ranging social and economic reforms. 

The country enjoyed a massive increase in oil revenues starting in late 1973 when international petroleum prices began a steep rise. His economic policy began with a cautious continuation of the former regime's five-year plan but turned toward industrial expansion as oil revenues increased.

His government supported closer ties with Nasser and under his rule Iraq almost joined the United Arab Republic. The flag of Iraq was modified in preparation for this goal. 

Bakr's regime also strengthened Iraq's ties with the Soviet Union: On April 9, 1972, Iraq and the Soviet Union signed a treaty of friendship. The two countries agreed to cooperate in political, economic, and military affairs. The Soviet Union also agreed to supply Iraq with arms.
