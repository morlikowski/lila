'''Culture''' was a Jamaican roots reggae group founded in 1976. Originally they were known as the '''African Disciples'''. 

The members of the trio were Joseph Hill (lead vocals), Albert Walker (backing vocals) and Kenneth Dayes (backing vocals).

Shortly after Culture came together, they began working with the "Mighty Two" – producer Joe Gibbs and engineer Errol Thompson.  While at Gibbs’ studio, they recorded a series of powerful singles, many of which ended up on their debut album ‘Two Sevens Clash’. After their success with Gibbs, the group went on to make a string of albums for producer Sonia Pottinger.  Culture began working with some of the premier musicians of the day including Robbie Shakespeare, Sly Dunbar, Ansel Collins, Cedric Brooks and the ever-present percussionist Sticky.  Virgin Records picked up the albums, and that added distribution enabled Culture to gain an even larger following outside of Jamaica.

Critically considered one of the most authentic traditional reggae acts, at the time of the first ''Rolling Stone Record Guide'' publication, they were the only band of any genre  whose every recording received a five-star review (of bands with more than one recording in the guide).

In 1982 the three singers went their own ways.  Joseph Hill carried on using the Culture name, and recorded the ‘Lion Rock’ album, which was released in the United States by Heartbeat Records.  For their part, Walker and Dayes recorded a handful of songs on their own – a few of which turned up on an album titled ‘Roots & Culture’.
In 1986 the original line-up reformed to record two highly regarded albums – ‘Culture in Culture’ and ‘Culture at Work’.  These releases marked the beginning of a very busy period for the group, including annual albums and countless tours.  The U.S. label Shanachie released a steady stream of new and old Culture albums up to ’Wings Of A Dove’ in 1992.

Joseph Hill, who came to symbolise the face of Culture, died in Germany on 19 August 2006 while the group was on tour. Now Joe Hill's son Kenyatta Hill sings with the band.

'''Culture''' was een Jamaicaanse reggaeband gevormd in 1976. In die tijd was de naam nog African Disciples.</br>
Tijdens een Europese tour in 2006, waarbij ook Nederland werd aangedaan, overleed zanger en gezicht van de band Joseph Hill plotseling in Berlijn. Dit betekent waarschijnlijk het einde van een van de meest succesvolle reggaebands.

Culture meest bekende hits zijn ''The International Herb'', ''Jah Rastafari'' (beiden 1979) en ''Holy Mount Zion'' (1978), naast de wereldhit ''Two Sevens Clash''.
