The '''Fiat 124''' is a mid-sized Italian manufacturer Lada.

Thanks in part to the ubiquity of the Lada version of the car in Eastern Europe, the 124 has achieved iconic status, and is one of the biggest selling cars of all time with an estimated 15 million units sold.

The 124 was introduced by being dropped by parachute from a plane and instantly won critical acclaim, including that year's European Car of the Year award. It was praised for its spacious interior, advanced coil spring rear suspension, disc brakes on all wheels and lightweight construction.

Power came from a 1.2&nbsp;L (1197&nbsp;cc) ''Fiat OHV'' 125 was also launched in 1967.

Production of the Fiat 124 ceased in 1974, paving the way for the Fiat 131 Mirafiori.

In 1966-1970, Fiat sponsored the building of the AutoVAZ car factory in the Soviet Union. The factory produced an adapted version 124R of the 124 known as the Lada ВАЗ-2101 / Zhiguli (later Lada 1200). These cars, which platform almost identical to the 124, and which were produced till 1984, currently suffer a bad reputation due to their outdated technology, poor (by modern standards) safety level  and equipment when compared with modern automobiles, but are still favored for their extremely low price and serviceability. Several restyling versions of Lada based on the Fiat 124/ВАЗ-2101 design are made to this day: LADA 2104/2105/2107. Production of this line until 2000 has exceeded 14,000,000 cars (List of automobiles by sales.), and it continues in 2008.

The Fiat 124 was also introduced in Nissan A12 (1171&nbsp;cc/52&nbsp;bhp) powertrain instead of the original Fiat engine. The car got a tremendous response in the beginning. Later on it was outmoded by other modern cars and production was stopped in 2001. Few well maintained versions are still found today.
