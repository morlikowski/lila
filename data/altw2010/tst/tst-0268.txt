==Biografia==
Dopo l'invasione dei V-re del Kent Etelberto, sposò Berta, figlia del cristiano Canterbury (forse ne restaurò una già esistente), dedicandola a san Martino di Tours, patrono della sua famiglia (i Merovingi). Etelberto era pagano, ma si dimostrò molto tollerante e permise alla moglie di adorare il proprio Dio. Berta poté così organizzare una piccola comunità con tanto di sacerdoti. 

Etelberto, interessato al nuovo culto, chiese a missionari. Gregorio affidò il compito a un gruppo di 40 monaci benedettini del monastero romano di Thanet, accolto dal re in persona. Egli lo accompagnò a Canterbury e qui il monaco fu messo a capo della comunità. In breve tempo, lo stesso sovrano e migliaia di sudditi (secondo la tradizione, circa 10.000) chiesero il battesimo. Agostino rimaneva nel frattempo in contatto con il papa, elencando i successi conseguiti e chiedendo consigli. 

Nel Mellito, Giusto e altri portarono, assieme alle risposte del papa, dei libri, alcune reliquie ma soprattutto il ''Rochester. 

Seguendo le disposizioni del papa in materia di luoghi di culto, Agostino riconsacrò e ricostruì una vecchia chiesa a Canterbury che divenne cattedrale e fondò un monastero. Gli viene anche attribuita la fondazione della Scuola reale di Canterbury, che è tradizionalmente ritenuta la scuola più antica del mondo .

'''Augustine of Canterbury, OSB''' (born c. first third of the 6th century - died May 26, 604) was a Benedictine monk who became the first Archbishop of Canterbury in the year 598. He is considered the ''"Apostle to the English,"''<ref name=DictSaint>Delaney ''Dictionary of Saints'' pp. 67–68</ref>, a founder of the English Church, and a patron of England.<ref name=Saints></ref>

Augustine was the Saint Gregory the Great chose him in 595 to lead a mission to Britain to convert the pagan King Æthelberht of the Bertha, daughter of King of Paris, who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. Although the missionaries considered turning back before they reached Kent, Gregory urged them on, and in 597 Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet and proceeded to Æthelberht's main town of Canterbury.

King Æthelberht allowed the missionaries to preach freely and converted to Christianity, giving the missionaries land to found a monastery outside the city walls. Augustine was consecrated bishop of the English, and converted many of the king's subjects, including thousands during a mass baptism on Christmas Day in 597. Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601, along with encouraging letters and gifts for the churches, although attempts to persuade the native Celtic bishops to submit to Augustine's authority failed. Roman Catholic bishops were established at London and Rochester in 604, and a school was founded to train Anglo-Saxon priests and missionaries. Augustine also arranged the consecration of his successor, Laurence of Canterbury.

Augustine died in the year 604 and was soon revered as a Henry VIII.

==Background to the mission==
After the withdrawal of the Roman legions from the province of Britannia in 410, the natives of the island of British Church developed in isolation from Rome under the influence of missionaries from Ireland.<ref name=Hindley3>Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 3–9</ref><ref name=Mayr78/> This British church was centred on monasteries instead of bishoprics. Other distinguishing characteristics were its calculation of the date of St Alban and the occurrence of ''eccles'', derived from the Latin for church, in place names.<ref name=Yorke121>Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 121</ref> There is no evidence that these native Christians tried to convert the Anglo-Saxons.<ref name=ASE102>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 102</ref><ref name=Harting32/>

It was against this background that Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission to convert the Bertha before 588.<ref name=ASE105> Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 105–106</ref> Bertha was the daughter of pagan at this point but allowed his wife freedom of worship. One biographer of Bertha states that under his wife's influence, Æthelberht asked Pope Gregory to send missionaries.<ref name=DNBBertha/> The historian Ian Wood feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen.<ref name=Wood10>Wood "Mission of Augustine of Canterbury" ''Speculum'' pp. 9&ndash;10</ref> Other historians, however, feel that Gregory initiated the mission, although the exact reasons remain unclear. A famous story recorded by Bede relates that Gregory saw fair-haired Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people.<ref>Supposedly Gregory inquired about who the slaves were. He was told they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels. Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 99–100</ref><ref name=Harting57>Mayr-Harting ''The Coming of Christianity'' pp. 57–59</ref> More practical matters, such as the acquisition of new provinces acknowledging the primacy of the papacy, and a desire to influence the emerging power of the Kentish kingdom under Æthelberht, were probably involved.<ref name=Hindley33/> The mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards.<ref name=DNB>Mayr-Harting "Augustine [St Augustine] (d. 604)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

The choice of Kent and Æthelberht was probably dictated by a number of factors, including the fact that Æthelberht had allowed his wife to worship freely. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established, and the language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Another reason for the mission was the growing power of the Kentish kingdom.  Since the eclipse of King River Humber. Lastly, the location of Kent near the Franks allowed support from a Christian area.<ref name=Brooks6>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 6–7</ref>

In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, who was the prior of the abbey of St Anthony in Rome, to head the mission to Kent.<ref name=ASE104/> Gregory selected monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish kingdom. The Pope wrote to a number of Frankish bishops on Augustine's behalf, introducing the mission and asking that Augustine and his companions be made welcome. Copies of letters to some of these bishops survive in Rome. The pope wrote to King Brunhild, seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King Speculum'' p. 9</ref>

Sources make no mention of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission. Pope Gregory once wrote to Æthelberht complimenting Augustine's knowledge of the Bible, so Augustine was evidently well-educated. Other qualifications included administrative ability, for Gregory was the abbot of St Anthony as well as being pope, which left the day-to-day running of the abbey to Augustine, the prior.<ref name=Fletcher116/>

==Arrival and first efforts==
Augustine was accompanied by Speculum'' p. 11</ref> but it probably took place in 597. In the early medieval period, large scale conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and Augustine is recorded as making large numbers of converts within a year of his arrival in Kent.<ref name=Brooks8/> Also, by 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism.<ref>The letter, as translated in Brooks' ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'', p. 8, says "preserve the grace he had received". ''Grace'' in this context meant the grace of baptism.</ref> A late medieval tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler Whit Sunday, or June 2 597; there is no reason to doubt this date, although there is no other evidence for it.<ref name=Brooks8>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 8–9</ref>

Augustine established his episcopal see at Canterbury.<ref name=DNB/> It is not clear when and where Augustine was consecrated as a bishop. Bede, writing about a century later, states that Augustine was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop Ætherius of Arles after the conversion of Æthelberht. Contemporary letters from Pope Gregory, however, refer to Augustine as a bishop before he arrived in England. A letter of Gregory's from September 597 calls Augustine a bishop, and one ten months later says that Augustine had been consecrated on Gregory's command by bishops of the Germanies.<ref name=Brooks5>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 5</ref>

Soon after his arrival, Augustine founded the Peter and Paul, which later became St Augustine's Abbey,<ref name=DNB/> on land donated by the king.<ref name=Blair61>Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' pp. 61–62</ref> In a letter Gregory wrote to the patriarch of Alexandria in 598, he claimed that more than 10,000 Christians had been baptised; the number may be exaggerated but there is no reason to doubt that a mass conversion took place.<ref name=ASE105/><ref name=Fletcher116/> However, there were probably some Christians already in Kent before Augustine arrived, remnants of the Christians who lived in Britain in the later Roman Empire.<ref name=Harting32>Mayr-Harting ''The Coming of Christianity'' pp. 32–33</ref>

After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with a report of his success along with questions about the mission.<ref name=ASE106>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 106</ref> Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his ''Ecclesiastical History'': Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.<ref name=Bede71>Bede ''A History of the English Church'' pp. 71–83</ref>

Further missionaries were sent from Rome in 601.  They brought a metropolitan status, and signified that Augustine was now an archbishop. Along with the pallium, a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to ordain 12 suffragan bishops as soon as possible and to send a bishop to York. Gregory's plan was that there would be two metropolitans, one at York and one at London, with 12 suffragan bishops under each archbishop. As part of this plan, Augustine was expected to transfer his archiepiscopal see to London from Canterbury. The move from Canterbury to London never happened; no contemporary sources give the reason,<ref name=Brooks9>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 9–11</ref> but it was probably because London was not part of Æthelberht's domains. Instead, London was part of the kingdom of Essex, ruled by Æthelberht's nephew Saebert of Essex, who converted to Christianity in 604.<ref name=Hindley33/><ref name=Fletcher453>Fletcher ''The Barbarian Conversion'' p. 453</ref> The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see was indeed moved to London, and that it was only with the abandonment of London as a see after the death of Æthelberht that Canterbury became the archiepiscopal see. This theory contradicts Bede's version of events, however.<ref name=Brooks11>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 11–14</ref>
