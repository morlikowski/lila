His compositions include works for orchestra, quartet, and solo piano, while his musical style ranges from "quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth".<ref name="NaplesDailyNews"></ref>

Active since 1983, he played various instruments in rock bands throughout the Midwest until 1989 when Greek composer Ethnicity'' tour. He also spent four years as musical director and lead keyboardist for Sheena Easton, including a 1995 performance on the ''Tonight Show with Jay Leno''.

In 1994, his solo career began when he independently released ''Rapture'', an instrumental album recorded with a 50-piece orchestra, in which Joseph wrote and conducted all of the scores. It was released on the Narada label and reached New Age Voice (NAV)'s "Airwaves Top 30". He has produced 15 CDs/DVDs and numerous piano books under his own record label, Robbins Island Music. Two of these recordings, ''Christmas Around the World'' and  ''One Deep Breath'', also held positions on NAV's Top 100 radio chart. His music is included in multiple various-artist compilation albums, most recently the 2008 release of ''The Weather Channel Presents:  Smooth Jazz II''.

==Biography==
Bradley Joseph was born in 1965 and raised in Moorhead State University as a music major, he led some of his own bands around the area that toured Midwest nightclubs, such as in the group Ian Faith.<ref name="IanFaith"></ref> He played sax and guitar in some of these earlier bands but left them to concentrate on just the piano/keyboards.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/> Later, he started performing with guitarist Chameleon in the late 70s and early 80s.

====Yanni====
In 1989, Joseph recorded his first demo tape and sent it off to Greek composer Yanni, who was looking for someone to replace keyboardist John Tesh, as Tesh was launching his own solo career.<ref name="Yanni in Words">{{cite book|last = Yanni

After moving to Los Angeles at age 23,<ref name="AlbumNotesStories"></ref>  he composed, arranged, and performed alongside Yanni for more than six years, performing in-concert with a number of notable symphony orchestras, touring throughout the U.S. and abroad as Yanni gained worldwide fame.<ref name="Bradley Joseph to play for Concerts in the Park">{{cite news|title = Bradley Joseph to play for Concerts in the Park

Imagine all these different cultures coming together with the challenges of language, equipment, travel, and weather problems.  I still picture the police running their dogs through the dressing rooms to sniff out any bomb possibilities right before the show.  People still come up to me and comment how that show has affected their lives."<ref name="SJSheet"/>  

In the band, Joseph covered a lot of the keyboard parts that Yanni could not for lack of hands in the shows.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/> He assisted with the task of managing the 30 or more synthesizers onstage,<ref name="SL Tribune1">{{cite news|last=Buttars|first=Lori|title =Yanni's New Age Compositions are at Home...|publisher = U.S.)|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SLTB&p_theme=sltb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10112E4FD6708C92&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM

Between tours, Joseph worked extensively in recording studios on music ranging from rock and pop to rhythm and blues and orchestration with numerous artists from Epic, title = Yanni Live, The Symphony Concerts 1994 - Official concert program|publisher = [[Yanni

====Sheena Easton====
Joseph also performed with co-musical director and lead keyboardist.<ref name="Continuing Journey"></ref>  He went from Yanni to Easton and back to Yanni in a few years.  "It was a great transition from Yanni because it made me musically aware again", he said in reference to Easton's R&B style. "I went back to where I started but it felt like a new invention."<ref name="Joseph has Encountered Fame"></ref> 

 Wheeler questioned how he got hooked up with Easton; Joseph answered that he was recommended by a former road manager. He was included in a try-out with four others, rehearsed with the band, they then cut it down to two, and rehearsed with Sheena for the final cut.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/> Joseph anticipated they would ask him to do a solo on at least one of the songs he was asked to play during the audition, so he wrote a solo for all three songs, which was ultimately the reason he was hired for the job.<ref name="WPSaward">Speech: {{cite web

In a 1995 interview, he said that after five years of touring with Yanni and working on his own debut album, he needed a break.  Yanni was still building his career and maintained a hectic concert schedule.  Working with Easton, on the other hand, was "the best of both worlds".  "She just adopted a baby and is pretty settled in", said Joseph.<ref name="Heeeeeeere's Bradley"/> Tour venues with her included Japan, Indonesia, Puerto Rico, and the United States,<ref name="Official bio"/> as well as routine appearances in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.<ref name="Heeeeeeere's Bradley"/> In March 1995, he appeared with her on the ''Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' when she performed her new single at the time, "My Cheri".<ref name="Joseph Tonight Show">{{cite news|last = Miller|first = Gary|url=http://cc.msnscache.com/cache.aspx?q=73518719313114&mkt=en-US&setlang=en-US&w=d2131ca9,94c52e8e&FORM=CVRE3| title =''Joseph, Tonight Show''

===Solo career===
In 1994, between world tours, Joseph released his debut album, ''Charlie Adams (drums, percussion); Ric Fierabracci (fretless bass); Jeanette Clinger (vocals); and Grammy-winning violinist Charlie Bisharat.  Other guest artists include Larry Preston (guitar); and Terry Brau — featured on numerous Bradley Joseph recordings — playing trumpet, saxophone, and fluegelhorn. 
 
Joseph's style attracted the attention of world-wide web.  A representative for Narada came across his website and downloaded some music.  This sparked their interest and resulted in signing Joseph to a multi-record deal, according to Peter Spellman of the Berklee College of Music.<ref name="BerkleeShares">Mr. Joseph is referenced in book by:  {{cite book|last = Spellman|first=Peter (author)|coauthors=Fiest, Jonathan (editor)

Although he said that working with Narada was a great experience music-wise, Joseph did not like the lack of control over the end product, and asked to be released from his contract.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  He started Robbins Island Music in 1998, composing, producing, and distributing his own recordings. ''Solo Journey'' was released and consists of eleven soft piano compositions that are based on mood and not on melody.<ref name="WPSaward"/>  It is characterized by Debbage as being a "scaled down introspective, ... and while simplistic was still breath-taking".<ref name="Christmas Around the World at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"></ref>  

Later releases include ''Christmas Around the World'' reaching NAV's top 100 radio playlist;<ref name="New Age Voice">New Age Voice, currently </ref> and ''One Deep Breath'' also holding a position on NAV's top 100 radio chart for over six months.<ref name="NAV's top 100"></ref>  Bill Binkelman writes, ''"One Deep Breath'' is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in-between. While I doubt fans of Liquid Mind or other mainly electronic new age music artists would wholly embrace the overt romanticism of piano-led tracks like 'Dancers Waltz' or 'Dreamer's Lullaby', there is definite appeal on the album for fans of adult contemporary piano pieces as well as for lovers of the more minimal approach to new age music."<ref name="One Deep Breath-Wind and Wire Magazine-BB"></ref>  Reviewing for ''Allmusic'', Jim Brenholts describes ''One Deep Breath'' as a set of smooth adult contemporary pieces in which Joseph adds "world music flair and inspirational touches".  "The vocal expressions by Clystie Whang and Joseph have devotional qualities that weave through the atmospheres and soundscapes smoothly."<ref name="One Deep Breath at Allmusic">{{cite web |author=Brenholts, Jim

Debbage writes, "The magical world of movies has a knack for exploring sequels. There is the beauty and beast effect when taking this pathway. The creative beauty allows the viewers to see the continued growth of its characters. The beastly aspect of this exploration is the Hollywood exploitation of an almost guaranteed return on its investment with no regard for its creative progression that usually sees diminishing returns. Bradley Joseph has decided to walk this tightrope by following up with ''Solo Journey'' that was released back in 2000. I am glad to report that ''The Journey Continues'' is entrenched in beauty, holding up well to its predecessor."<ref name="The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/>

Subsequent releases include ''For the Love of It'', ''Hymns and Spiritual Songs''.  On these albums, Joseph arranges piano, orchestra, and soft rhythms to cover melodies such as "Sting), and "Ave Maria" (Schubert).

====Thoughts on success as an independent artist====
Having experienced both avenues of recording on a major label and later choosing to be an independent artist, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music.  He spends most of his time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. "I’m my own boss. I can do what I want. I can change directions", he told ''West Central Tribune'''s Anne Polta.<ref name="Continuing Journey"/>    As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  "A lot of musicians don’t learn the business. You just have to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what’s in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent."  "I couldn’t license my music if it wasn’t mine", he said. "It has allowed me to create CDs. It separates you from the million other great players."<ref name="Continuing Journey"/>  

But some artists just want to  be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both.  Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants.  He advises, "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time.  All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything."  "Perseverance is King."<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  When asked by Wheeler what brought him back to Minnesota after living in Los Angeles and traveling around the world, Joseph replied, "The first thing business people say is 'First and foremost, if you want to be successful, live where you want to live'."  He grew  up there and family were important to him.  When he decided to become a solo artist he wanted to be comfortable in his environment and moved back.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>
