==Biography==

Born in Libya in 1945, Ali Omar Ermes travelled to England to further his education; he earned his diploma in design at the Plymouth School of art and design in 1970 and later attended the Central School of Art in London for a short period. On his return to Libya, he wrote extensively and headed the visual arts section of All Arts magazine. In 1974 he was contracted to work as the visual arts consultant to the festival director for the World of Islam Festival (1976), preparing for exhibitions on Islamic art and culture and meeting artists and calligraphers, museum directors and various intellectuals across the Muslim world. He worked for a few years writing and researching, travelling frequently, on different artistic and publishing projects until 1981, when he decided to move to England where he lives today with his family. Over the years, Ermes has participated in various Muslim community projects, written about many important issues and has exhibited in some sixty to seventy exhibitions around the world. <ref>‘A lifetime of painting’, Venetia Porter, Q News No: 302 & 303, London, 01 March 1999</ref>

Ermes has spoken at national and international conferences on a variety of social and cultural issues. A selection of his papers includes: ‘Art and Islam’ (‘Mutualities: Britain and Islam’ conference, Royal Commonwealth Society, London, April 1999), ‘Contemporary Islamic arts: a positive contribution to London’ (‘The Middle East in London’ conference, SOAS, June 2001); ‘A glimpse of Islamic heritage’ (‘Islam UK’, the BBC’s Islam Season, SOAS, September 2001), ‘The invisibility of the Arab community’ ([http://www.londoncivicforum.org.uk/ London Civic Forum], March 2002); ‘The importance of faith-based education for the Muslim community’ (‘Faith in the UK and Development Education’ seminar organised by the [http://www.dea.org.uk/ Development Education Association], London, March 2003), ‘The Arabic language as a national cultural issue’ (‘Better Arabic Calligraphy’ conference, Calligraphy Centre, Bibliotheca Alexandrina, Egypt, July 2004); ‘The Arab media in Britain’ (‘Domination, Expression and Liberation in the Middle East’ conference, [http://www.lmei.soas.ac.uk/ London Middle East Institute], School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), London, July 2004); ‘Culture beyond stereotype: an artist’s experience’ (Islam and Arts’ conference, Oldham, November 2004); ‘Multi-Cultural Europe – The Muslim perspective’, VIII conference, ‘European culture’, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain, October 2005); ‘Plural identity and European citizenship’ (European Parliament, Brussels, November 2007).  

==Community activities==

He is the chairman of the Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre (MCHC) in the Kensington and Chelsea Borough, London, formally inaugurated by HRH the Prince of Wales in May 2001. The MCHC provides a wide range of social, cultural and educational training as well as religious facilities to people in North Kensington, London and the surrounding areas. .<ref>[http://www.almanaar.org.uk/profile/governance.cfm "Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre profile"]</ref>

He has also served on the executive board of the London Civic Forum, an organisation that engages the capital’s civil society in the regional governance of London. Ermes is the co-founder, and was the co-chairman, of the Forum of Faiths in the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. 

==Ermes' opinions==

As a thinker, Ali Omar Ermes has remained true to his Arab and Muslim/humanitarian roots, deriving his opinions on issues such as identity, art, culture and life from Islamic teachings and traditions. He has written and spoken about many topics, voicing his thoughts on issues as varied as education, media and language. 

Concerning today’s world and the relationship between politics and the media, Ermes explains, <i>“We live in a global village, where instant communications make new inroads on our consciousness from moment to moment. But we are faced with shifting priorities in the media which, at any given moment, may not reflect the true state of affairs.”</i> He continues, <i>“Just because we are faced with a flood day and night of sound bites, it doesn’t mean that we are getting any closer to the solution.” </i><ref>Reaching Out, edited by Sajid Rizvi, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1993</ref>. 
On the issue of the environment, Ermes cautions that <i>“even more alarming is the indiscriminate exploitation of the Earth’s resources. The ecological disaster that we have invited upon ourselves shows how short-sighted we are. At the rate at which that is being done, man is exhausting not only the available resources but also the options.” </i><ref>Reaching Out, edited by Sajid Rizvi, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1993</ref> 

==Muslims in Europe or European Muslims?==

On the question of identity, an issue that is at the centre of many current debates, especially with regards to European Muslims, Ali Omar Ermes observes that <i>“many European Muslims feel they have to be more European than the average, standardising their perspective on life and assimilating their characteristics in order to minimise unfair rejection found in some sectors of the society”.</i> <ref>‘Plural identity and European Citizenship’ speech, European Parliament, Brussels, November 2007</ref> He believes, however, that <i>“it serves in Europe’s favour for Muslims to bring their originality and ethnicity, instead of hypocritically erasing their individuality, values and heritage”.</i> Ermes asserts firmly that the <i>“plural identity is the only identity”.</i> <ref>‘Plural identity and European Citizenship’ speech, European Parliament, Brussels, November 2007</ref>

To highlight the complexity and commonality of the European identity between Europe and Muslims, in his speech at the University of Navarra, Pamplona, Ermes uses modern Spain as an example <ref>‘Multi-Cultural Europe – The Muslim perspective’, VIII conference, ‘European culture’, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain, October 2005</ref>: 

<blockquote>“Take a group of modern Spaniards; they might be from the North, East, middle, West or deep South. If you dig up their roots and look at their family trees, they most probably unveil like this: They are descendents of a mix of Romans coming from the South and East. Their forefathers were Greek Romans, some converted or remained Jewish, a number of the later generation became Christians, Catholics and non-Catholics. After Islam came to Spain, a sizeable number of them became Muslims, and a few centuries later the Spanish Inquisition took place which persuaded some back to Catholicism. A few generations after that and with the rise of ideological conflicts in Europe, many followed various branches of anarchism, communism and nationalism, a number of those were led to become agnostic] and [[atheistic and finally many of them hurried to enter the materialistic paradise of the consumer society to enjoy all fruits of the open market, and all other markets coupled with globalisation.

Quite a journey for one example of modern day Europeans, when we have been led to believe that coming from Europe meant a pure homogenous race believing in the pure Christian religion with pure northern values and cultures. The question is, what identity can you give this group of people? And what identity will they be able to give themselves?”</blockquote>

In another speech, he makes observes that European Muslims are in a bit of a British, French, German Turkish Muslim etc, you are accused of not being European enough. And on the other hand, when European Muslims claim Europe as their home, they get accused of taking over the place!” </i><ref>‘Plural identity and European Citizenship’ speech, European Parliament, Brussels, November 2007</ref>

He is a firm believer in the Islamic universality of citizenship, which, he argues, is one of the reasons the Islamic culture is a <i>“culture beyond stereotype”,</i> since <i>“there is no cultural or racial dominance to base assumptions on”.</i> He also observes that </i>“stereotyping is an expression of defeat”</i> <ref>‘Culture beyond stereotype: an artist’s experience’, Islam and Arts Conference, November 2004, UK</ref>. Ermes concludes that <i>“the point the European public seems to have missed is, being a better Muslim means being a better European citizen. Not only does Islam require a person to respect the laws and customs of the country they reside in, the moral code instilled in a Muslim is that of a caring citizen, which requires them to belong to the society, appreciate its values, acknowledge its norms and criticise its ills for the benefit of themselves and society at large.” </i><ref>‘Plural identity and European Citizenship’ speech, European Parliament, Brussels, November 2007</ref>

==Positive contributions of the Muslim presence in Europe==

The Muslim contribution to European civilisation during the Islamic Golden Age is only recently beginning to gain the recognition it deserves. Furthermore, Ermes posits that today’s European Muslims have played a vital role in shaping the continent. These contributions are many, historical, cultural, financial and social. However, to take the Muslim economic contribution in Britain, home to approximately two million Muslims, as an example, the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, cites ‘a new estimate of 10,000 Muslim millionaires in Britain and an overall community contribution of £31 billion a year to the economy’. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/08/population.islam "Officials think UK's Muslim population has risen to 2m"], ''The Guardian''</ref> Going above and beyond all of the contributions to culture, diversity, food, fashion etc., Ermes explains some of the less obvious benefits, at a conference held in the European Parliament: <ref>‘Plural identity and European Citizenship’ speech, European Parliament, Brussels, November 2007</ref>

*Muslims in Europe are the key to a billion-and-a-half-member market of Muslims worldwide. Their familiarity and observed characteristics provide a primer on how to deal with/understand/trade with/interact with other Muslims around the world.

*Muslim’s determination to join others in upholding morality, and at times they lead the resistance against unethical and corruptive aspects within societies. Not everybody accepts or appreciates this; there are many that benefit from the degradation of morals and ethics. And when Western Muslims raise the stakes regarding what is good and moral out of care and concern for their society, some interested parties will use it negatively, which adds to the misunderstanding and even hatred towards Muslims.

*Some Muslims not born in Europe hail from countries that have restricted press, and they therefore place extreme importance on the notion of free speech and media, making Muslims in Europe probably more media aware than the average European citizen.

* Muslims are strong believers in the system, so much so that they are able to criticize it; being at home in Europe means speaking out against things you feel are wrong. 

==Art as a bridge==

Ali Omar Ermes "is an internationally renowned artist, one of the most gifted contemporary Islamic artists of today and probably the most collected artist in the Islamic world." <ref>[http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20031029050241 "Ali Omar Ermes In Context"], ''Zawya''</ref> He is a painter who uses the Arabic script, with all its rich multitude of literature and it’s ever evolving visual expression, as the subject of his compositions. His distinctive technique places the Islamic and Arabic identity in a contemporary light, by involving it in an accumulative but new form of expression. His work has been said to bring dynamism and vitality to the world of Islamic art and has been described as “a bridge between the divide of cultures and languages”, as <b>Dr James Allen of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford</b>, concluded. <ref>Reaching Out, edited by Sajid Rizvi, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1993</ref>

<blockquote></i>“As an artist, I am in a constant search, a ceaseless movement to broaden the means of my artistic and poetic expression and stretch the frontiers of my art and writing. I want all the different instruments of my art, from colour to movement to poetry, with its rhythm and resonance, to develop further, to attain a greater power of expression. I hope these aspirations are accessible to everybody, and hospitable to other cultures, other ideas, alongside my own. This would bring me the greatest joy.”</i> <b>Ali Omar Ermes </b><ref>‘Visual Dimensions of Literature’ in “Inscribing Meaning”, 5 Continents Editions, 2007</ref></blockquote>

<b>Art consultant Dale Egee</b> confirms the realisation of these aspirations “Ali Omar leaves a legacy, he has brought the beauty of Arabic calligraphy to all of us in the non-Arab world, and we are the richer for that.” <ref>‘Ali Omar Ermes in Context: Modern Islamic Art’, Art Advisory Associates Ltd, 1st Edition, October 2003</ref>

==Recent exhibitions==

==Ali Omar Ermes' Art==

Ermes’ paintings are composed of script-style text and abstracts and range from approximately 1 m square to 3 m square and larger. His work embodies the traditional Arabic love of literature through stunning spontaneous images of various calligraphic letterforms. He places his subject matter against a rich abstract background (and, at times, monocolour) deriving from it a rich heritage of Andalusia, North African and Middle Eastern Arabic and Islamic cultures. His paintings have been credited in highlighting the beauty and elegance of the Arabic letterforms.<ref>‘A lifetime of painting’, “Art and Ideas”, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1991</ref> He states: <i>“Beauty is the marriage of intellectual vision and moral foundation, of commitment to principles and performances conforming to the highest standards of technical excellence.” </i><ref>‘Visual Dimensions of Literature’ in “Inscribing Meaning”, 5 Continents Editions, 2007</ref>

Ermes delights in shape and colour and has a traditional, deep-rooted respect for detail. His talent as a photographer adds an extra disciplined approach to his technique. The text by itself is a device which triggers a sense of shape, colour, space and musicality of images. Through his combination of text, the colours, the forms, the sense of space and rhythm results in a powerful array of visual and musical compositions. Ermes describes how he arrived at his technique, <i>“The way I use the colour and brush work in my paintings is, I believe, the result of an audacious exploration of avenues and by crossing borders usually closed in the education of art.” </i><ref>“Reaching”>Reaching Out, edited by Sajid Rizvi, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1993</ref>

The background to most of his artwork is a harmonious mixture of colours and textual inscriptions taken from Arabic classical poetry, prose, traditions and proverbial sayings, generally containing strong, often political, messages about justice, honour, wisdom and humanitarian issues. His references are various aspects of the rich Islamic living heritage and cultures as well as the various strands of human experience. As <b>Faisal Rafique,</b> MCB Direct, remarks, “He is an artist with a unique gift; the ability to merge paint and prose. His work is original, vibrant, striking and intricate.” <ref>[http://www.mcb.org.uk/features/features.php?ann_id=165 "Ali Omar Ermes Exhibition"], ''MCB Direct''</ref>

<blockquote><i>“The fusion of Arabic and Islamic art and literature were like two entities evolving together: poetry lending its powers in an abstract visual form and abstract art manifesting all elements of poetry’s music and mood in its visual code.”</i> <b>Ali Omar Ermes</b> <ref>‘Visual Dimensions of Literature’ in “Inscribing Meaning”, 5 Continents Editions, 2007</ref></blockquote>

The titles of his paintings all indicate pathways towards a common purpose. “‘Iqra!’” (‘Read!’), “‘The Power of Expression’” and “‘Narrative Stream’” are just three of his ‘liquid’ works. “These wonderful paintings have many stories to tell and the stark beauty of the single letter at the heart of the composition transcends all boundaries.” <b>Venetia Porter, British Museum. </b><ref>‘A lifetime of painting’, “Art and Ideas”, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1991</ref>

==Connection, or ‘silah’==

One element of Ali Omar Ermes’ composition is that of connection, or ‘silah’, between the various dynamics at play – between art and poetry, colour and rhyme, past and present, East and West, the continuity of the human experience, links to other civilisations, reaching out to his audience. Bringing to light human issues, from various Islamic references, regarding how humans should treat each other with kindness and generosity and give consideration to all human pains and ills. “Thus art reflects life for Ermes, a Libyan Muslim living in London, providing a new synthesis of East and West. This is precisely what he strives for in his paintings, reaching towards a sense of value which is no longer tied to cultural or personal norms, an art that speaks directly to the human heart.” <b>Stephen Hirtenstein, Muhyiddin Ibn ‘Arabi Society, Oxford</b> <ref> ‘The painting speaks’ in “Ali Omar Ermes”, Art Advisory Associates Ltd, 1st Edition, 2008</ref>

==Arabic and Islamic poetry==

A poet himself, Ali Omar Ermes interweaves the wisdom and beauty of expression of early Arabic poetry into his compositions. “At times the poetic lines are concise, ordered and almost incidental to the letter, at others they swirl around the contours of the letters like crowds acclaiming their hero” <b>Stephen Hirtenstein, Muhyiddin Ibn ‘Arabi Society, Oxford. </b><ref> ‘The painting speaks’ in “Ali Omar Ermes”, Art Advisory Associates Ltd, 1st Edition, 2008</ref> His favourite poets are many, among them the pre-Islamic literary pioneer Zubair Ibn Abi-Sulma (early seventh-century AD) and Sala’a bin Amr (late sixth-century AD), a pre-Islamic poet who was famous during his lifetime for his eloquence as an orator; he believed that a stable society can result only from good consultative government by a noble elite. Many outstanding Islamic poets include Abu Firas Al-Hamadani (d. 323 AH/935 AD), a Hamadani prince and poet imprisoned by the Byzantines, who wrote tremendous diatribes against his capturers and expressed the Arab ideal of chivalry and the importance of honour and dignity. Of even greater impact on Ermes are the great poets Abu Al Tayyib Al-Mutanabbi (965 AC), who is known as the most quoted poet, and Abul Ala Al-Ma`arri, the philosopher, who, among other Arab and Muslim thinkers, brought issues of the human condition to the forefront of the thinking of the day. Turning to modern times, the two great contemporary poets Ahmed Shawqi and Al-Jawahiri are among his favourites. “Poetry absorbed in abstract art, and abstract art using poetry’s music and mood – this is the essence of Ali Omar Ermes’ art. This artistic expression, which uses the Arabic script as a form of subject matter, has become uniquely his own.” <b>Francisca Voo, New Straits Times</b><ref>Francisca Voo, ‘Language of Arab poets in Ermes’ art’, New Straits Times, 1993</ref>

==Reviving interest in the Arabic language==

One of the main aims of Ali Omar Ermes’ artwork is to stir the curiosity of his audience by encouraging them to look beyond his paintings to the source of his inspiration and thereby realise the greatness of Arabic literature and philosophy. His paintings pay homage to the rich content of the Arabic language and aim to keep alive traditional stories of wise reflections.<ref>‘A lifetime of painting’, “Art and Ideas”, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1991</ref> <i>“One of my ultimate objectives is to revive interest in Arabic, a language that has contributed so much to the progress and evolution of science, literature, arts and moral values of the world.” </i><ref>‘Visual Dimensions of Literature’ in “Inscribing Meaning”, 5 Continents Editions, 2007</ref> On another occasion, Ermes explained that <i>“some may see the Arabic element of paintings as introducing a sense of mystery but it’s not a mystery, it’s an invitation for any inquisitive mind to go deeper into aspects of Islamic culture and history.”</i> <ref>Reaching Out, edited by Sajid Rizvi, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1993</ref>

<blockquote>“To enjoy an exhibition of his work is rather like embarking on a crash-course of ancient Arabic poets, and you’ll probably come away wanting to discover more.” <b>Arsalan Mohammad, Time Out</b><ref>Arsalan Mohammad, Time Out, 25 January 2007</ref></blockquote>

==Ali Omar Ermes’ thoughts on art==

It is Ermes’ belief that the origins of abstract art stem from the very nature of Islam. He asks, <i>“What is meant by abstractionism today? Somehow it’s got linked to modern western art but abstraction is a very Islamic idea.”</i> He expands this point further, <i>“I do question, both in spiritual and materialistic terms, the value of most work of replication of what is already there, beautifully made by the All-Mighty Allah.”</i> <ref>Reaching Out, edited by Sajid Rizvi, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1993</ref> <i>“Therefore, the aims of Islamic art are not mimicking what is there already, which the artist can only distort, in a way, through his/her own vision. Based on this philosophy, Muslims turned to creating art all around them, from the carpets they walked on, to the ceramics they drank from, adding the geometric designs that we all know. The advent of Islam led to a total beautification of surroundings, using their creative forces as human beings to start a new artistic phase.”</i> <ref>“Art and Ideas”, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1993</ref> Ermes proceeds with a definition, <i>“Art in Islam is an ongoing process of creativity based on theoretical knowledge and practical know-how in all areas of human endeavour and walks of life. It is the power to grasp, to hold, to imagine and dream to which God All-Mighty gave to humanity in dealing with this creation. To enjoy, behold and take part in order for it to work together in harmony and contrast.” </i><ref>‘Visual Dimensions of Literature’ in “Inscribing Meaning”, 5 Continents Editions, 2007</ref>

Ermes also observes how the consumption of cheap ideas has taken hold of many contemporary art productions which <i>“make few demands on the human intellect or the human spirit”.</i> And he puts forward an alternative in the form of Islamic art, <i>“because throughout this period of upheaval on the world art scene, we have played by the rules of human behaviour and followed the path which gives art its necessary moral backbone. As for the ‘million-dollar trash’ so prevalent in the art world these days, Ermes bids ‘good luck to those who produce it and those who buy it. Fortunes may change hands, but what are we left with for posterity? What does this do for the spiritual well-being of mankind?”</i> <ref>Reaching Out, edited by Sajid Rizvi, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1993</ref>

==Art as responsibility==

Ali Omar Ermes explains his distinctive philosophy of how Islamic art is best interpreted. <i>“For modern Islamic art to leave any impression at all on posterity, the Muslim artists need to do more than create pretty pictures. They need to identify themselves with the most positive aspects of human endeavour and to bring themselves to the level of Islamic thinking where it concerns morality and discipline and awareness of man’s duties towards nature and towards each other.”</i> He continues, <i>“It does not matter if contemporary societies fail initially to see the moral thrust and social responsibility of Islamic art. Not for the first time are Muslim artists and intellectuals facing difficulties and, in certain cases, having to make sacrifices, while holding on to their principles. Most pioneering work has had this problem of lack of acceptance in the beginning and then it has been vindicated.”</i> <ref>Reaching Out, edited by Sajid Rizvi, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1993</ref>

Art in Islam is not without its conditions. <i>“Art in Islam is a responsibility and a very heavy one. This is because the impact on society could be great on the positive or the negative sides. I see an artist as a thinker and pioneer who disciplines himself/herself and channels his/her imagination to create and educate at the same time.” </i><ref>‘Art and Islam’ speech, ‘Mutualities: Britain and Islam’ conference at the Royal Commonwealth society in London, April 1999</ref> <ref>Reaching Out, edited by Sajid Rizvi, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1993</ref>

When asked how the issue of injustice relates to the community of art and artists today, Ermes replies that <i>“the artist has two choices. He or she can either be a part of that all-pervasive system of injustice and succumb to the myriad corruptions, falsehoods and enticements that come with it, or he/she can decide to stick to his/her morals and defend his/her integrity and honesty in the best human way possible. Frankly, from an Islamic point of view, that is what art is all about….Thus the way an artist conducts himself or herself determines not only whether he/she is a good citizen of the world or not, but also whether he/she is a good artist. This, at least, is the way I see it.”</i> <ref>Reaching Out, edited by Sajid Rizvi, Saffron Books/Eastern Art Report, 1993</ref>

==Islamic art today: a mission of revival and positive engagement==

For over forty years, Ali Omar Ermes has raised his concerns about the status of Islamic art in the world today. What follows is a list of just a few of the points he has made to identify problems and implement solutions in order to work towards a sustained and authentic revival of Islamic art. Ermes explains, <i>“Take the lack of any presence (or hardly) of Islamic art works in public places in this country and others for that matter, or their given share of all sorts of budgets and mainstream activities being very minimal and not adequate in proportion to the potential multiple varieties of art produced by this largely talented section of the society. This has to change very rapidly if we want the best of these situations to work for all of us and this concerns most of the public sector with new plans and the right attitude.”</i> <ref>‘Culture beyond stereotype: an artist’s experience’, Islam and Arts Conference, November 2004, UK</ref>

He continues, <i>“Muslim and Islamic Art is being used today, and has been for a long time, as a treasure house and as a gold mine without the slightest respect or full acknowledgement of its sources and to which culture it belongs to in most cases. It is being used and abused in so many negative and unjust ways by media, academic establishments and commercial companies alike. This has to be rectified with serious initiatives from the decision makers on all levels with real plans and solid work in consultation with the right people, i.e., responsible and knowledgeable Muslims that can be in partnership with professional people with the right heart and mind from the mainstream, if we are going to keep the best of human creative treasures intact and to pass its powers of inspiration and stimulation to others for a better future.”</i> <ref>‘Art and Islam’ speech, ‘Mutualities: Britain and Islam’ conference at the Royal Commonwealth society in London, April 1999</ref>

==Solutions==

Ermes outlines the steps necessary to rectify these concerns, some of which are already in effect, some of which are not: <ref>‘Culture beyond stereotype: an artist’s experience’, Islam and Arts Conference, November 2004, UK</ref><ref>[http://www.aliomarermes.co.uk/press/view_citation.cfm?press_id=48 “Conversation with Ali Omar Ermes”]</ref>

*The funding and encouragement of positive representation and engagement of Islamic art and Muslims.

*Support from Muslims and non-Muslims alike and from the establishment, museums, public galleries, theatres, publishers, organisations, companies, etc.

*Support tailored to Islamic ethos and Muslim understanding.

*The establishment of serious negotiations with educational policy-makers to introduce new, creative and positive ways for a comprehensive curriculum, which takes Islamic ethos and ethics on board, to be taught at all relevant levels of education. 

*The inclusion of positive Islamic art, literature, and creative inputs in mainstream systems of education and museums, theatres and media programmes to increase the public’s appreciation for Islamic culture and improve community relations.

*Creation of one central museum of Islamic art in the country, and a few regional ones, according to Islamic ethos to help Muslims and non-Muslims to benefit from Islamic art.

*The integration of charitable and non-charitable institutions and organisations, independently of or in partnership with, mainstream society. To emerge, prosper and engage is one way of reckoning with the Muslims and Muslim culture for the better.
