'''James Lane Buckley''', född New York 1971-1977, chef för Radio Free Europe 1982-1985 och domare i en federal domstol 1985-2000.

Han avlade 1943 sin grundexamen vid Yale University. Han var medlem i sällskapet Skull and Bones under studietiden vid Yale. Han deltog i andra världskriget och studerade sedan juridik vid Yale Law School. Han inledde 1950 sin karriär som advokat i Connecticut. Han var vice verkställande direktör för ''Catawba Corporation'' 1953-1970.

Som medlem i Conservative Party of New York bestämde sig Buckley att kandidera till USA:s senat i 1968 års kongressval. Han utmanade Jacob K. Javits som var en ledande liberal republikansk senator. Trots att Buckley fick många konservativa republikanska röster kunde han inte hindra Javits omval. Två år senare utmanade han en annan liberal republikan, Charles Goodell. Goodells motstånd till Vietnamkriget hade gjort honom speciellt sårbar bland konservativa väljare. Goodell hade dessutom bara varit i senaten i två år, dit han hade utnämnts av guvernör Nelson Rockefeller efter mordet på Robert Kennedy. Buckleys seger innebar en stor skräll och det är den enda gången som Conservative Party of New York har lyckats få sin egen kandidat invald i konkurrens mot de två stora partierna. Partiet stödjer ofta republikanska kandidater, men inte i sådana val där republikanernas kandidat är liberal.

Buckley kandiderade demokraten Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

Buckley tjänstgjorde på utrikesministeriet och som chef för Radio Free Europe under Ronald Reagans första mandatperiod. Han var därefter domare i en federal appellationsdomstol. Han efterträddes i appellationsdomstolen i District of Columbia av John Roberts.

==Senate career==
In 1968, Buckley challenged liberal Republican Senator Jacob Javits for re-election. Javits won easily, but Buckley received a large number of votes from disaffected conservative Republicans, and in 1970, ran for the U.S. Senate against liberal Republican incumbent Charles Goodell. Goodell had been appointed to the Senate by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller following the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and had made a name for himself in the Senate as an opponent of the Vietnam War. Buckley's campaign slogan, plastered on billboards statewide, was "Isn't it time we had a Senator?"<ref>http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0703150099mar15,1,850637.column</ref>

With Goodell and the Democratic nominee, Richard Ottinger, splitting the liberal vote, Buckley won a plurality (38 percent) and entered the Senate in January 1971.

In 1974, he proposed a "human life" amendment, which defined the term "person" in the Fourteenth Amendment to include the embryo.

In his 1976 re-election bid, with Rockefeller's liberal GOP faction falling apart, Buckley received the Republican nomination. Initially, he was favored for re-election, because the frontrunner in the crowded Democratic field was right. But when primary and narrowly defeated Abzug, Buckley could no longer count on getting the votes of moderate Democrats. Moynihan went on to defeat Buckley by a wide margin.

After his loss, Buckley moved to Connecticut, and in 1980 received the Republican nomination for the Senate seat being vacated by the retirement of Abraham Ribicoff. He lost the general election to Christopher Dodd, who still serves in the Senate.

He was the last Senator to be elected from a party other than the Democrats or Republicans. Since 1974, two independent candidates (Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut) have been elected, but no minor-party candidates have won election to the Senate.
