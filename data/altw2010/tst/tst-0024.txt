'''''Dykes to Watch Out For''''' (sometimes '''DTWOF''') is a comic strip by Alison Bechdel.  The strip began in 1983.

DTWOF chronicles the lives, loves, and politics of a fairly diverse group of characters (most of them lesbians) living in a medium-sized city in the United States, featuring both humorous soap-opera storylines and biting topical commentary.  The strip is carried in Funny Times and a number of gay and lesbian newspapers, and also posted on the web.<ref>Bechdel discusses the changeover from self-syndication to the web [http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/support-this-site/ on the official site.]</ref>

According to Bechdel, her strip is "half op-ed column and half endless, serialized Victorian novel". Characters react to the contemporary events including going to the Michigan Womyn's Festival, Gay Pride parades and protest marches and having heated discussions about day-to-day events, political issues and the changing lesbian culture. The strip is one of the most successful and longest-running queer comic strips. 

On May 10, 2008, Bechdel announced that she was putting the strip on indefinite hiatus in order to complete her graphic novel memoir ''Love Life'', due in late 2009. <ref>http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/winds-of-change</ref>

== Main characters ==

The central characters include:

* '''Mo Testa''' (given name Monica), the central character, a politically committed lesbian feminist with a tendency to kvetch.  Previously a worker at Madwimmin Bookstore who then worked briefly at Bounders Books and Muzak (a parody of Borders Books and Music) while earning a library science degree before getting a job as a reference librarian.
* '''Lois McGiver''', a sex-positive activist, drag king, a clerk at Bounders Books and Muzak (formerly at Madwimmin) and housemate to Ginger and Sparrow, currently dating single mother '''Jasmine''', mother of transgender teenager '''Janis''' (originally introduced as Jonas). 
* '''Ginger Jordan''', a struggling academic and English Syrian marriage of convenience to a man. 
* '''Sparrow Pidgeon''' (birth name Prudence), former women's shelter director and New Ager-turned-atheist, who identifies herself as a "bisexual lesbian" and is currently involved with a straight Jewish male activist and stay-at-home dad, '''Stuart Goodman''', with whom she has had a child, '''Jiao Raizel''' (or J.R.).  Lois and Stuart are currently homeschooling Janis and J.R. Sparrow and Ginger had purchased the house they shared with Lois (and later Stuart) after rooming together for years; Ginger recently moved out, and the group was able to buy Ginger out of the house by Sparrow taking the Executive Director position at the state NARAL office.<ref>Revealed in [http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/dtwof-episode-508#more-403 strip #508].</ref>
* '''Clarice Clifford''', a workaholic environmental lawyer and college girlfriend of Mo's.
* '''Toni Ortiz''', a CPA and business manager, who has a child with Clarice; she was a stay-at-home-mom for several years while raising their son '''Rafael Clifford-Ortiz''' (or Raffi).  Toni and Clarice have had a commitment ceremony in the backyard, a civil union in Vermont, and a (not legally recognized by the state) marriage at City Hall. They are now exploring the phenomenon of divorcing without court involvement. Clarice has moved in with Sparrow, Stuart and Lois, taking the room recently vacated by Ginger. 
* '''Dr. Sydney Krukowski''', an academically involved, materialistic, yuppie Women's Studies professor with a compulsive spending habit, Mo's lover and recently a breast cancer survivor.
* '''Jezanna Ramsay''' (birth name Alberta), manager of the late lesbian bookstore Madwimmin Books, which also employed Mo, Lois, and '''Thea''', a Jewish lesbian with multiple sclerosis who was Sydney's lover in college.  Since the closure of Madwimmin due to financial woes, Thea and Jezanna seldom appear.  We have learned that Jezanna now teaches English as a second language, and Thea is teaching art to kids. 

Only some of the characters' surnames are known, since such names appear only when it is appropriate to the dialogue (when Ginger and Sydney, as college instructors, are addressed as "Professor Jordan" and "Dr. Krukowski," for instance) and are not established from the beginning.
