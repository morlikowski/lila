'''Old English''' (also called '''Anglo-Saxon''',<ref>The term ''Anglo-Saxon'' came to refer to all things of the early English period by the 16th century, including language, culture, and people.  While this is still the preferred term for the latter two aspects, the language starting from the 19th century began to be called Old English.  This is because the language itself began to be studied in detail, and scholars recognized the continued development of the English language from the Anglo-Saxon period to Middle English and through to the present day.  However many authors still use the term Anglo-Saxon to refer to the language. <br> </ref> ''Englisc'' by its speakers) is an early form of the Old Norse, a member of the related North Germanic group of languages.

==Development==

Old English was not static, and its usage covered a period of approximately 700 years<ref>See ''Anglo-Saxon migrations that created England in the fifth century to some time after the Norman invasion of 1066, when the language underwent a dramatic transition. During this early period it assimilated some aspects of the languages with which it came in contact, such as the Celtic languages and the two dialects of Old Norse from the invading Vikings, who were occupying and controlling large tracts of land in northern and eastern England, which came to be known as the Danelaw.

===Germanic origins===
The most important force in shaping Old English was its Germanic heritage in its vocabulary, sentence structure and grammar which it shared with its sister languages in continental Europe. Some of these features were specific to the West Germanic language family to which Old English belongs, while some other features were inherited from the Proto-Germanic language from which all Germanic languages are believed to have been derived.

Like other inflected with five dative, and instrumental, though the instrumental was very rare), which had dual plural forms for referring to groups of two objects (but only in the personal pronouns) in addition to the usual singular and plural forms.  It also assigned gender to all sunne'' (the mōna'' (the Moon) was masculine (cf. modern German ''die Sonne'' vs. ''der Mond'').

===Latin influence===
A large percentage of the educated and literate population (Saxons left continental Europe for Britain. The second began when the Anglo-Saxons were converted to Christianity and Latin-speaking priests became widespread. The third and largest single transfer of Latin-based words happened after the Norman invasion of Norman words entered the language. Most of these Oïl language words were themselves derived from Norman form. The Norman Conquest approximately marks the end of Old English and the advent of Middle English.

One of the ways the influence of Latin can be seen is that many Latin words for activities came to also be used to refer to the people engaged in those activities, an idiom carried over from Anglo-Saxon but using Latin words. This can be seen in words like ''militia'', ''assembly'', ''movement'', and ''service''.

The language was further altered by the transition away from the futhorc'' or fuþorc) to the cniht'', the Old English ancestor of the modern ''knight'', was pronounced.  Another side-effect of spelling words phonetically was that spelling was extremely variable – the spelling of a word would reflect differences in the phonetics of the writer's regional dialect, and also idiosyncratic spelling choices which varied from author to author, and even from work to work by the same author. Thus, for example, the word ''and'' could be spelt either ''and'' or ''ond''.

Old English spelling can therefore be regarded as even more jumbled than modern English spelling, although it can at least claim to reflect ''some'' existing pronunciation, while modern English in many cases cannot.  Most present-day students of Old English learn the language using normalised versions and are only introduced to variant spellings after they have mastered the basics of the language.

===Viking influence=== 

The second major source of loanwords to Old English were the Scandinavian words introduced during the place names, these consist mainly of items of basic vocabulary, and words concerned with particular administrative aspects of the sky'', ''leg'', the they'', the verb form ''are'', and hundreds of other words.

===Celtic influence=== 
Traditionally, many maintain that the influence of Celtic on English has been small, citing the small number of Celtic loanwords taken into the language. The number of Celtic Scandinavian; distinctive Celtic traits have been argued to be clearly discernible from the post-Old English period in the area of syntax.<ref></ref>

===Dialects===

Old English should not be regarded as single monolithic entity just as Modern English is also not monolithic. Within Old English there was language variation. Thus, it is misleading, for example, to consider Old English as having a single sound system. Rather, there were multiple Old English sound systems. Old English has variation along regional lines as well as variation across different time periods. For example, the language attested in West Saxon during the time of Æthelwold of Winchester, which is named Early West Saxon (or Æthelwoldian Saxon), is considerably different from the language attested in West Saxon during the time of Alfred the Great's court, which is named Late West Saxon (or Classical West Saxon or Alfredian Saxon). Furthermore, the difference between Early West Saxon and Late West Saxon is of such a nature that Late West Saxon is not directly descended from Early West Saxon (despite what the similarity in name implies).

The four main Mercian, Northumbrian (known collectively as Anglian), Kentish, and West Saxon.<ref></ref> Each of those dialects was associated with an independent kingdom on the island. Of these, all of Kent that were successfully defended were then integrated into Wessex.

After the process of unification of the diverse Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in 878 by Alfred the Great, there is a marked decline in the importance of regional dialects. This is not because they stopped existing; regional dialects continued even after that time to this day, as evidenced both by the existence of middle and modern English dialects later on, and by common sense – people do not spontaneously develop new accents when there is a sudden change of political power. 

thumb|The first page of the [[Beowulf manuscript]]

However, the bulk of the surviving documents from the Anglo-Saxon period are written in the dialect of Wessex, Alfred's kingdom. It seems likely that with consolidation of power, it became necessary to standardise the language of government to reduce the difficulty of administering the more remote areas of the kingdom. As a result, paperwork was written in the West Saxon dialect.  Not only this, but Alfred was passionate about the spread of the vernacular and brought many scribes to his region from Mercia in order that previously unwritten texts be recorded. 

The Church was affected likewise, especially since Alfred initiated an ambitious programme to translate religious materials into English. In order to retain his patronage and ensure the widest circulation of the translated materials, the monks and priests engaged in the programme worked in his dialect. Alfred himself seems to have translated books out of Latin and into English, notably Pope Gregory I's treatise on administration, "Pastoral Care".

Because of the centralisation of power and the Viking invasions, there is little or no written evidence for the development of non-Wessex dialects after Alfred's unification.

Modern-day Received Pronunciation is not a direct descendant of the best-attested dialect, Late West Saxon. It is rather a descendent of a Mercian dialect — either East Mercian or South-East Mercian. Thus, Late West Saxon had little influence on the development of Modern English (by which is meant RP or some similar dialect) and the developments occurring in its antecedent, Middle English.

===Morphology===

Unlike modern English, Old English is a morphological diversity and is spelled essentially as it is pronounced. It maintains several distinct cases: the nominative, accusative, genitive, dative and (vestigially) instrumental, remnants of which survive only in a few pronouns in modern English.

===Syntax===
====Word order====
The word order of Old English is widely believed to be subject-verb-object (SVO) as in modern English and most Germanic languages.  The word order of Old English, however, was not overly important due to the aforementioned morphology of the language.  So long as declension was correct, it didn't matter whether you said "My name is..." as "Mīn nama is..." or "Nama mīn is..."

=====Questions=====
Due to its similarity with Old Norse, it is believed that the word order of Old English changed when asking a question, from SVO to VSO; i.e. swapping the verb and the subject.
:"You are..." becomes "Are you...?"
:''"Þū bist..."'' becomes ''"Bist þū...?"

==Orthography==
250px|thumb|The [[runic alphabet used to write Old English before the introduction of the Latin alphabet.]]

Old English was first written in runes (''futhorc'') but shifted to a (minuscule) half-uncial script of the Latin alphabet introduced by Irish Christian missionaries. This was replaced by insular script, a cursive and pointed version of the half-uncial script. This was used until the end of the 12th century when continental carolingian minuscule (also known as ''caroline'') replaced the insular.

The letter Irish; the letter ðæt <&nbsp;&nbsp;> (called ''eth'' or ''edh'' modern English) was an alteration of Latin <&nbsp;&nbsp;>, and the runic letters thorn and conjunction ''and'', a character similar to the number seven (<&nbsp;&nbsp;>, called a OE thaet.png&nbsp;>). IPA symbols.

'''Conventions of modern editions.''' A number of changes are traditionally made in published modern editions of the original Old English manuscripts. Some of these conventions include the introduction of punctuation and the substitutions of symbols. The symbols <&nbsp;&nbsp;> are used in modern editions although their shapes in the insular script are considerably different. The insular symbol that is  substituted by modern <&nbsp;&nbsp;> resembles the elongated ''esh'' <&nbsp;&nbsp;>. Insular <&nbsp;&nbsp;><ref>Insular <&nbsp;&nbsp;> is not equivalent to Middle English ''yogh'' <&nbsp;&nbsp;>.</ref> is usually substituted with modern <&nbsp;&nbsp;> (which is ultimately a carolingian symbol). Additionally, modern manuscripts often distinguish between a velar and palatal <&nbsp;&nbsp;> and <&nbsp;&nbsp;> with diacritic dots above the putative palatals: <&nbsp;&nbsp;>, <&nbsp;&nbsp;>. The ''wynn'' symbol <&nbsp;&nbsp;> is usually substituted with <&nbsp;&nbsp;>. Kentish <&nbsp;&nbsp;> is usually substituted with modern <&nbsp;&nbsp;>. Macrons are usually found in modern editions to indicate putative long vowels while they are usually lacking in the originals. The decision to add macrons is usually etymologically based as they are printed even when these vowels are in unstressed positions where are they would most probably be short.

The alphabetical symbols found in Old English writings and their substitute symbols found in modern editions are listed below:

==Literature==

Old English literature, though more abundant than literature of the continent before AD 1000, is nonetheless scanty.  In his supplementary article to the 1935 posthumous edition of Bright's ''Anglo-Saxon Reader'', Dr. James Hulbert writes:

<blockquote>In such historical conditions, an incalculable amount of the writings of the Anglo-Saxon period perished.  What they contained, how important they were for an understanding of literature before the Conquest, we have no means of knowing: the scant catalogs of monastic libraries do not help us, and there are no references in extant works to other compositions....How incomplete our materials are can be illustrated by the well-known fact that, with few and relatively unimportant exceptions, all extant Anglo-Saxon poetry is preserved in four manuscripts.</blockquote>
