'''Orangeville''' is a village in Stephenson County, Illinois, United States. The population was 751 at the 2000 census. The area's earliest white settlers arrived in 1833 and the village was platted in 1851 by John Bower, who is considered the village founder. In 1867 Orangeville was incorporated as a village. The town's central business district contains several 19th century commercial buildings many of which were built during the railroad boom of between 1888&ndash;1914. By the time the Great Depression was ongoing, business in Orangeville had started to decline, with the last bank closing in 1932.

Orangeville is about two miles (3 km) south of the Illinois&ndash;Central House hotel occupies the highest lot. Public education in Orangeville is the responsibility of Orangeville Community School District #203 which operates an elementary school and a combination junior and senior high school.

==History==
===Early history===
Orangeville is in Oneco Township, which was first settled by Simon Davis in 1833. Before 1837 the area was occupied by Native Americans who utilized it for hunting grounds; the  buffalo and Dixon Land Office. Curtis constructed a dam on Richland Creek, and on the creek's west bank erected a gristmill and a saw mill. Curtis died in 1843 and both mills stood idle until John Bower arrived in 1846, with his family, after having visited the area the year before. Bower purchased the 80 acres and the mills.<ref name=nrhp2>Buford, John C. "[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/114796.pdf AF and AM Lodge 687]," (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, December 2002, HAARGIS Database, ''Illinois Historic Preservation Agency''. Retrieved 9 October 2007.</ref>

Throughout the 1830s and 1840s farmers from German immigrant. A Dr. Thomas Van Valsah led a wagon train from Pennsylvania to Stephenson County in 1837.<ref name=nrhp2/>

The village of Orangeville was founded by John Bower, popularly confused as "Bowers." Bower came to Stephenson County in 1845 and, on October 16, 1846, bought the land that would be platted as Orangeville from for $950. Bowers built the Union House in 1849 on a portion of what became Orangeville in 1851.<ref name=nrhp>Buford, John C. "[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/205596.pdf Union House]," (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, 29 November 1999, HAARGIS Database, ''Illinois Historic Preservation Agency''. Retrieved 9 October 2007.</ref> Though the town was platted by Bower in 1851, it was not incorporated until 1867.<ref name=nrhp2/> A drawing of the plat was done by surveyor Marcus Montelius and indicated that Orangeville has always been known as Orangeville; several publications have asserted that the town began as Bowersville or Bowers Mills and underwent a name change in 1854.<ref name=nrhp1/> It is possible that the incorrect name Bowersville was a misremembered version of "Bower's mill".<ref name=janeaddams/> The plat also showed 48 original town lots.<ref name=nrhp1/>

At the outset, Bower brought "wagon loads" of lumber from Galena and Chicago to the settlement, and by 1849 he had reconstructed and improved the gristmill. The mill was completed in 1850 at a cost of $8,000. Charles Moore, who would become the first President of the village when it was incorporated, came to the town, lured by Bower's efforts, in 1849. George Hamilton built a store and soon farmers began to build houses, by 1850 a stagecoach served the area. In September 1852 construction began on Orangeville's first church.<ref name=nrhp1/>

By 1854 Orangeville was in competition with the village of Oneco as a growing center of commerce. That year, the federal government decided that population growth in the two villages warranted the establishment of a post office. On an appointed day, residents of both villages lined up on the sides of the street according to which town they supported as the location for the post office. Orangeville won by a narrow margin.<ref name=nrhp2/>

===Arrival of the railroad===
After its incorporation the village continued to prosper, the downtown district was mostly complete by the 1870s, with all commercial lots purchased and improved. Mel Trotter who established a chain of rescue missions during his lifetime, was born in the village on May 16, 1870 and lived there until he was five years old when his family moved to Polo, Illinois.<ref name=hertel>Hertel, Leona.

Retrieved 9 October 2007.</ref> By 1877, the village population was up to 300 and in 1883 the ''Orangeville Alert'', the first village newspaper, was established. In 1887, the Illinois Central Railroad decided to link Freeport to Madison, Wisconsin. The only incorporated village along that line was Orangeville, the railroad came in 1888 and led to commercial building boom.<ref name=nrhp3/> This building boom directly resulted in 14 new buildings being erected downtown, all brick buildings downtown save the 1906 Wagner Building and the 1899 R.W. Moore Building were a result of the railroad. Between 1888 and 1914 numerous business developed along the corridor of Main and High Streets, those included: restaurants, drug stores, barber shops, banks, watch and clock repair shops, cigar factory, funeral parlor and casket factory, among several others.<ref name=nrhp3/>

===Great Depression===
In 1928, just before the onset of the downtown business district. Though the downtown district no longer had a major thoroughfare passing through it, many of the business were able to survive, at least initially. By 1928 the decline in the business community of Orangeville was evident; the bypass, coupled with the depression continued to negatively affect the village. In 1932 the People's State Bank, the last open bank in Orangeville, closed its doors.<ref name=nrhp3/>
