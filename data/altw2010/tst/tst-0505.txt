'''CTV電視網'''（CTV Television Network）是全CTVglobemedia集團。值得一提的是，「CTV」這組英文字母並沒有官方解釋，但通常都被註釋為「Canadian Television」（加拿大電視台）的簡寫。

==歷史==

直至1950年代末及1960年代初，加拿大的電視市場完全由國營的加拿大廣播公司（CBC）壟斷。後來，政府開始批出地區性的民營電視台牌照。這些地區性私營頻道陸續在1960年至1961年間啓播，並於1961年10月結盟為「加拿大電視網」（Canadian Television Network）。網絡在次年易名為「CTV電視網」（CTV Television Network）。

CTV於各地區的分台，起初都屬於不同的母公司，而各分台都共同持有網絡的控制權。但經過數十年來的一系列收購合併，原來只是持有多倫多分台的巴頓廣播公司（Baton Broadcasting）已經差不多完全吞併了整個網絡。而巴頓廣播於1990年代末期亦乾脆易名為CTV, Inc.

There has never been a full name for the initals "CTV".  However, many people take them to mean "Canadian Television", which was used in a promotional campaign by the network in the late 1990s.

==History==

===Early years===
In 1958, Prime Minister Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver in response to an outcry for another programming choice.  Calgary and Edmonton were served by privately owned CBC affiliates; the other six by owned-and-operated CBC stations.

The eight winners, in order of their first sign-on, were:

*CFCN-TV Calgary (September 9, 1960)
*CHAN-TV Vancouver (October 31, 1960)
*CJAY-TV (now CKY-TV) Winnipeg (November 12, 1960)
*CFTO-TV Toronto (January 1, 1961)
*CJCH-TV Halifax (January 1, 1961)
*CFCF-TV Montreal (January 20, 1961)
*CJOH-TV Ottawa (March 12, 1961)
*CBXT-TV Edmonton (October 1, 1961)

The first seven stations were privately owned; the Edmonton station was a CBC Eastern Conference.  He needed a network in order to broadcast the games.  After some wrangling with Bassett and the BBG, Caldwell finally had his network.  The '''Canadian Television Network''' (CTN)  launched on October 1, 1961; composed of the seven ITO stations plus CFRN. 

(In April 2008, local CTV and A-Channel stations across Canada aired special reports celebrating "50 years of local news".<ref>[http://50yearsofnews.ctv.ca/ CTV - Local News Matters]</ref><ref>[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/April2008/08/c3619.html CTV and A-Channel Celebrate Local News], CTV press release, 8 April 2008</ref> While several of the local stations that later joined CTV launched in the early 1950s (as CBC affiliates), neither the network nor any local CTV-owned station launched in 1958; indeed CTV has avoided making claims about the celebration being an "anniversary" of a specific event.<ref>[http://50yearsofnews.ctv.ca/index.php/background/ CTV - Local News Matters - Background] (list of CTV-owned stations that launched in the 1950s)</ref> The reports instead appear to be timed to a CRTC review of regulations for local TV stations.)

The CTV network's first night on-air began with Harry Rasky's promotional documentary on the new network. That was followed by a fall season preview program.<ref name=GMOct61></ref>

CTV's initial 1961–1962 season began with the following programs, five of which were Canadian productions:<ref name=GMOct61 />

#''Checkmate'' United States (CBS)
#''Cross Canada Barndance'' Canada

#''Showdown'' Canada
#''Sing Along With Mitch'' United States (NBC)

At first, flagship CFTO was the only station that carried programming live.  During CBC's off-hours, CTV used CBC's microwave system to send programming to the rest of the country on tape delay.  Eventually, a second microwave channel opened up, enabling live programming from coast to coast.

The CBC had objected to the network's initial name, apparently claiming it had exclusive rights to the term "Canadian". The private network soon adopted an alternative, "CTV Television Network". Sources differ as to whether this occurred prior to the network launch or in fall 1962. The ''Globe and Mail'' referred to the network as CTV upon its 1961 debut.<ref name=GMOct61 />

The Caldwell-led management team immediately ran into financial trouble, and relations between the network and its stations were not smooth at first since CTV had essentially been the product of a forced marriage.  For example, most of the rights to American programming rested with the ITO, not CTV.  In many cases, CTV found itself competing with its own stations for the rights to programming.

===Becoming a broadcasting powerhouse===
Caldwell's departure in 1965 did little to alleviate the situation, and CTV soon found itself of the verge of bankruptcy. In 1966, the network's affiliates (which by this time included St. John's, Kitchener and CHAB/CHRE in Moose Jaw/Regina) sought permission to buy the network and run it as a cooperative. The board readily approved the proposal, and by the start of the 1966-67 season, the stations owned their network.  

By the mid-1970s, CTV had expanded its footprint across Canada, mostly by twinstick arrangements in smaller cities and with CBC affiliates switching to CTV once the CBC opened its own stations or added rebroadcasters of nearby O&O stations. In a unique twist, the original Saskatchewan affiliate, CHAB/CHRE, was bought by the CBC in 1968 (and eventually recalled CBKT), allowing Regina's original station, CKCK-TV, to join CTV. In 1994, the CTV cooperative became a corporation.

CTV made a name for itself in news coverage when it convinced star CBC news anchor Lloyd Robertson to switch networks in 1976.  Robertson has been the network's main anchorman ever since. The network also has the country's longest-running national morning news show, ''Canada AM''. Its weekly newsmagazine series, ''W-FIVE'' has been a fixture on the network since 1966, predating the similar American program ''60 Minutes'' by two years.

In the late 1970s, CTV often bought rights to pop and rock songs to serve as theme music for its programming, rather than commissioning original themes. Most notably, ''W5'' used an instrumental portion of Definition'' used Quincy Jones' "Soul Bossa Nova".

===Baton takes over===

In the mid-1980s, Baton Broadcasting, owners of flagship CFTO in Toronto, began a drive to take over CTV by buying as many affiliates as possible.  It had already bought CFQC-TV in Saskatoon in 1971.  Baton purchased the following stations between 1986 and 1990:

* 1986:  CKCK Regina; CICC-TV Yorkton, Saskatchewan; CIPA-TV Prince Albert, Saskatchewan 
* 1988:  CJOH Ottawa
* 1990:  MCTV in northern Ontario (Sudbury, North Bay, Timmins, Sault Ste. Marie)

One caveat, however, was the "one owner, one vote" provision of the cooperative's bylaws.  Any acquisition of one station by an existing station owner triggered an automatic redistribution of the acquired station's shares among the other owners.  As a result, even though it owned 11 of CTV's 24 affiliates, Baton only had one vote out of eight. Nor were there any retroactive changes when CTV was restructured in 1994 (although Newfoundland Broadcasting, owner of CJON, decided to effectively relinquish its vote, reducing the number of votes to seven).

In 1996, Baton acquired CFCN from ATV. This gave Baton controlling interest in the network, triggering a put option allowing the remaining affiliates to sell their CTV shares without selling their stations, which they did. Baton was now full owner of the CTV network and immediately began plastering the CTV brand across its stations, even on non-network programming, and dropped its secondary Baton Broadcast System (BBS) brand. The company changed its name to CTV Inc. in 1998, and eventually acquired two of the final three large-market stations, CKY and CFCF. (It replaced the third, CHAN, as discussed below.)

==Recent history==

In 2000, typical of the ownership consolidation trend at the time, The Globe and Mail'' newspaper, combining them into a media division known as Bell Globemedia. BGM also subsequently acquired a minority share in the French-language network TQS, which broadcasts in Quebec.

CTV has legally been a "television service" in the eyes of the CRTC since 2000, when it allowed its network licence to expire.  CBC, TVA and Aboriginal Peoples Television Network are the only official television networks in Canada.

CTV lost significant coverage in Newfoundland at the beginning of the 21st century, starting with a major TV realignment in Vancouver.  In 2000, Victoria.  A year later, after its CTV contract ran out, CanWest made CHAN the Global O&O for all of BC, taking advantage of CHAN's massive network of repeaters that cover 97% of the province.  CTV shifted its programming to CFCN or CFRN as its main affiliates<!-- According to the Shaw.ca website -->.

Meanwhile, in 2002, CJON in St. John's dropped its CTV affiliation after CTV attempted to alter its affiliation agreement in a way that Newfoundland Broadcasting found unfair.  For 38 years, CJON had aired the base CTV schedule essentially for free since CTV paid it for the airtime.  CJON then bought additional CTV programming and sold all advertising.  However, CTV tried to make CJON pay for the base schedule as well, with no possibility of airtime payments.  It also increased the fees for additional CTV programming beyond what CJON claimed it could pay.  Newfoundland Broadcasting also didn't want to continue to carry CTV's national advertising during these programs.  At the start of the 2002-03 season, CJON dropped nearly all CTV programming except for CTV's national newscasts; in exchange it provides news coverage of Newfoundland and Labrador events to CTV.  In recent years, all of CTV's non-news programming has disappeared from the station.  CTV does not currently have a primary affiliate in St. John's, restricting some original programming to satellite only.

CTV has attracted some controversy in the past because of cutbacks to its small-market stations. The four Maritime stations, known collectively as ''CTV Atlantic'' (then known as ATV), and the four Yorkton and Prince Albert.  Today, the stations now simulcast supper-hour and late-night news from CKCK and CFQC respectively, placing local inserts into the newscasts.

In September 2005, CTV announced an alliance with MTV Networks which saw the relaunch of MTV Canada.
