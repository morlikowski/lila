The '''''' was a group of Norwegian black metal enthusiasts in the early 1990s, which was idendified by some as a cult – the '''Black Metal Inner Circle'''. Consisting of youths ranging from late teens to mid-20s, most of such enthusiasts congregated at the record store '''Helvete''' in Oslo. It is from this scene that the "Second Wave" of black metal emanated, and possibly where later crimes, that would overshadow this era of black metal, had been conceived and elaborated. 

The scene was the focus of controversy due to crimes committed by some of its members; two cases of murder, alleged cannibalism and over a dozen cases of arson. In addition to this, "satanic" crimes were attributed to the black metal scene in the Norwegian media. For example, one Norwegian TV channel conducted an interview with a woman who claimed that her child was sacrified by "satanists".<ref name=SrM>Satan rides the Media (1998)</ref> 

==Helvete==
During May-June 1991,<ref>In May or June 1991, according to the Interview with ''Bård Eithun''; Lords of Chaos (1998): 66</ref> Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth of the band Mayhem opened an independent record store which he called ''Helvete''. The term ''Helvete'' is Norwegian for ''Norse expression ''hels víti'', meaning ''the punishment of Emperor, and Snorre Ruch of Thorns. Euronymous also founded his record label Deathlike Silence Productions in its basement, releasing some of the most important Norwegian black metal recordings. Bård Faust worked in Helvete and lived at the back of the building,<ref name="guard" /> and Samoth also lived there for a time.<ref name = "hist2"></ref>  The store's walls were painted black and decorated with medieval weapons, posters of bands, and picture discs, while its window featured a polystyrene tombstone.<ref name='guard'></ref> In summer 1993, the store was closed only months before Aarseth's murder by Varg Vikernes of Burzum.

==Black Metal Inner Circle?==
Although the scene is often referred to as the "Black Metal Inner Circle" (particularly by Aarseth), such a term is highly disputable. Not only would it imply that some sort of Lords Of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground'' both claim the existence of the "Black Metal Inner Circle". For example, an online announcement for a film based on ''Lords of Chaos'' reads: 
<blockquote>In an escalating unholy war, black metal bands and their obsessive fans have left a grim legacy of suicide, murder and terrorism spreading from Norway to Germany, Russia, America and beyond. The feature film will focus on the relationship between legendary figures Varg Vikernes and Euronymous and the rest of the 'Black Circle' as they wage war against the powers that be in their native country.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=43850 'Lords Of Chaos' Norwegian Black Metal Movie To Go Into Pre-Production - Nov. 5, 2005] Retrieved on September 10, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.hansfjellestad.com/film/ Hans Fjellestad Homepage,] mentioning a screenplay "Lords of Chaos" as being in pre-production; Retrieved on September 11, 2007</ref></blockquote>

However, in his review of ''Lucifer Rising'', Varg Vikernes denied the existence of the "Black Metal Inner Circle", claiming: 
<blockquote>First of all the so-called Black Circle was something Euronymous made up because he wanted to make people believe there was such a thing, but it was nonsense and never existed. The media on the other hand believed it existed for a while, but quickly stopped talking about it when they understood it was a fake rumour.<ref></ref></blockquote>

Similarly, when asked in ''Lords of Chaos'' "What was the Black Circle?", Bård Faust replied:
<blockquote>It's just a name that was invented for the people who hung out at the shop ... there wasn't anything like members and membership cards and official meetings.<ref>Lords of Chaos (1998): 67</ref></blockquote>

==Suicide of Per Yngve Ohlin==
On 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin (aka 'Dead') committed suicide in a house shared by the band. Fellow musicians often described Ohlin as a quiet and introverted person. However he was best known for his infamous performances – which involved cutting himself, carrying around a dead crow, and wearing clothes that had been buried weeks prior to the event.<ref>[http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-june1998.htm Hellhammer interviewed by Dmitry Basik (June 1998)]</ref><ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1419364,00.html "In The Face of Death" (20 February 2005)]</ref>

He was found with slit wrists and a Øystein Aarseth (aka 'Euronymous'). Ohlin's suicide note read "Excuse all the blood" and included an apology for firing the weapon indoors. Before calling the police, Aarseth went to a nearby store and bought a disposable camera to photograph the corpse, after re-arranging some items.<ref>[http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-lords.htm ''Lords of Chaos'' (1998): Hellhammer interview]</ref> One of these photographs was later stolen and used as the cover of a bootleg live album entitled ''Dawn of the Black Hearts''.<ref>[http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-sod.htm ''Sounds of Death'' magazine (1998): Hellhammer interview]</ref>

Eventually, rumours surfaced that Aarseth made a Jørn Stubberud (aka 'Necrobutcher') noted that "people became more aware of the [black metal] scene after Dead had shot himself ... I think it was Dead's suicide that really changed the scene."<ref>[http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/necro-unrestrained15.htm ''Unrestrained'' magazine #15: Necrobutcher interview]</ref>

==Murder of Øystein Aarseth==
On August-10-1993, Mayhem guitarist Øystein Aarseth (who went by the pseudonym 'Euronymous'). On that night, Vikernes and Snorre Ruch travelled from Bergen to Aarseth’s apartment in Oslo. Upon their arrival a confrontation began, which ended when Vikernes fatally stabbed Aarseth. His body was found outside the apartment with twenty-three cut wounds – two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back.<ref>Steinke, Darcey. "Satan's Cheerleaders" SPIN Magazine, February 1996.</ref>

It has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at "out doing" the stabbing in Lillehammer.<ref name = "ukcrlz">[http://music.yahoo.com/ar-257375-bio--Mayhem Mayhem Biography on Yahoo! Music]</ref> Vikernes claims that Aarseth had plotted to torture him to death and videotape the event – using a meeting about an unsigned contract as a pretext.<ref name = "nuokon">[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml Varg Vikernes - A Burzum Story: Part II - Euronymous]</ref> On the night of the murder, Vikernes claims he intended to hand Aarseth the signed contract and "tell him to fuck off", but that Aarseth attacked him first.<ref name = "nuokon"/> Additionally, Vikernes defends that most of Aarseth’s cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle.<ref name = "nuokon"/>

Regardless of the circumstances, Vikernes was arrested within days, and a few months later was sentenced to 21 years in prison for both the murder and church arsons. In a controversial display, Vikernes actually smiled at the moment his verdict was read, an image that was widely reprinted in the news media.<ref name = "nuokon"/> In May 1994, Mayhem finally released the album ''De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas'', which features Aarseth on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar. While granted a short leave in 2003, Vikernes attempted to escape his bounds in Tønsberg, but he was re-arrested in a stolen vehicle with various firearms.<ref>[http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article655724.ece Police nab 'The Count' after he fled jail - Aftenposten.no]</ref>

==Church arsons and attempted arsons==
Members and fans of the Norwegian black metal scene claimed responsibility for inspiring (and perpetrating) over 50 arsons directed at Christian churches between 1992–1996.<ref name = "vybirs"></ref><ref name=SrM />  Many of the buildings were hundreds of years old, and widely regarded as important historical landmarks. One of the first and most notable was Norway's Fantoft stave church, which the police believed was destroyed by Varg Vikernes of the one-man band Burzum.<ref name = "vybirs"/> He was found guilty for the arsons of Holmenkollen Chapel, Skjold Church and Åsane Church.<ref>Lords of Chaos (1998): 89</ref>

De '''Black Metal Inner Circle''' was een groep van blackmetalmuzikanten die grotendeels verantwoordelijk is voor de beruchtheid van black metal in z'n geheel, door verschillende brandstichtingen en moorden. De groep haar "hoofdkwartier" was de winkel van Øyrstein Aarseth - de gitarist van Mayhem. 

==Geschiedenis==

Deze groep was erg invloedrijk , zowel muzikaal als sociaal, op de opkomende black metal van de vroege jaren '90. De groep was erg controversieel. Ten eerste vanwege de misdaden die door sommige leden gepleegd zijn. Ten tweede vanwege de agressieve, en/of vreemde denkwijze van sommige leden. Zo was bijvoorbeeld theïstisch Satanist. Vanwege deze feiten wordt The Circle door sommigen gezien als een kleine terroristische groep, hoewel anderen dat ontkennen. 

De groep is rond 1990 opgericht door Emperor, Satyricon en Emperor. 

De groep haar Noors Paganisme/Bijbelse geloof aan van een laatste slag tussen God en Satan. Het atheïstisch Satanimse van Anton Szandor LaVey werd in The Circle verworpen; er werd een agressieve vorm van Satanisme aangehangen. Daarnaast gaf Aarseth zich vrijwel altijd negatief uit over bands buiten Noorwegen.

Toen Dead in 1991 zelfmoord pleegde, werden de geloven van de leden alleen maar sterker. De historische Staafkerk van Fantoft werd op 6 Juni 1992 dan ook in brand gestoken, gevolgd door verscheidene kerkbranden door heel Noorwegen. 

Toen Varg Vikernes Aarseth vermoorde kwamen deze criminele activiteiten aan het licht bij de politie. In Vikernes' huis vond men namelijk een lijst met misdaden gepleegd door leden van The Circle. Vikernes kreeg uiteindelijk 21 jaar cel opgelegd. Samoth (van Emperor) kreeg 18 maanden cel voor brandstichting. De Noorse pers heeft door deze veroordelingen veel gepubliceerd over The Circle
