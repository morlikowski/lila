===Antebellum Wakulla===
Wakulla County was created in 1843.  It may (although this is disputed) be named for the Indian word for "spring of water" or "mysterious water." This is in reference to Wakulla County's greatest natural attraction, springs, both in terms of depth and water flow. In 1974, the water flow was measured at 1.23 billion gallons per day—the greatest recorded flow ever for a single spring.

In an 1856 book, adventurer Charles Lanman wrote of the springs:  Another possible origin for the name Wakulla, not as widely accepted, is that it means "mist" or "misting", perhaps in reference to the Wakulla Volcano, a 19th century phenomenon in which a column of smoke could be seen emerging from the swamp for miles.

===Civil War ===
During the Civil War, Wakulla County was partly involved. From 1861-1865 a Union squadron blockaded the mouth of the St. Marks River. Confederates took the old Spanish fort site known as Fort Ward. The Battle of Natural Bridge eventually stopped the Union force that intended to take Fort Ward.

==Etymology==
The name ''Wakulla'' is corrupted from ''Guacara''. ''Guacara'' is a Spanish phonetic spelling of an original Indian name, and ''Wakulla'' is a Creek ''wa'', and as the Creek alphabet does not exhibit an "R" sound, the second element ''cara'' would have been pronounced ''kala'' by the Creeks. The Creek voiceless "L" is always substituted for the Spanish "R". Thus the word ''Guacara'' was pronounced ''Wakala'' by the Seminoles who are Muskhogean in their origin and language.

Since Wakulla was probably a Timucuan word, it is unlikely that its meaning will ever be known.  It may contain the word ''kala'' which signified a "spring of water" in some Indian dialects.<ref></ref>

<!-- It is taken for granted in the county that "Wakulla" is an Indian word meaning "Mysterious Waters". One of these days when I find a decent citable reference I'll add it in properly. -->

Wakulla County stands out in one statistical category: there is a near-absence of any municipal population in this county of perhaps 27,000. Two tiny municipalities hold maybe 3 percent of the population. The county seat, Crawfordville, is the only unincorporated county seat among Florida's 67 counties, and, lying only 20 miles from Tallahassee, that district has grown dramatically in recent years to an extraordinarily large and dense population for a "rural" place not touching or having any continuity with any incorporated town. The Crawfordville population center may now have 12-18,000 inhabitants in 10-20 square miles.

<!--The County's boosters claim that Crawfordville is the only place that has preserved one of Florida's old wooden courthouses, a handsome 3-story building used until after World War II.
