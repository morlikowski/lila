Eine '''Entdeckung''' ist der Schöpfen von etwas bislang noch nicht Vorhandenem darstellt.

Entdeckungen können nicht patentiert werden, sehr wohl aber Verfahren zur Anwendung einer Entdeckung.

Soweit es sich um individuelle Erkenntnisse handelt, die nicht weiter verbreitet werden, sind Entdeckungen ohne bleibenden Wert. Erst durch die Veröffentlichung und Verarbeitung der gewonnenen Daten und Informationen gewinnen Entdeckungen Bedeutung. Die bekannte Frage: "Wer entdeckte Amerika?" kann somit folgendermaßen beantwortet werden. Soweit sich keine weiteren Erkenntnisse aus der Reise Eriks des Roten gewinnen lassen, ist es Christoph Columbus, der den Kontinent einer breiten Öffentlichkeit bekannt gemacht ("veröffentlicht") hat.

Entdeckungen nennt man zudem die auf geographische, ethnologische und naturkundliche Gegebenheiten. In diesem Sinne sind Entdeckungen sowohl auf Mittel- und Südamerika sowie in Sibirien.

'''Exploration''' is the act of oil, gas, coal, ores, caves, water (Mineral exploration or prospecting), or information.

Although exploration has existed as long as human beings, its peak is seen as being during the Age of Discovery when European navigators traveled around the world discovering new lands and cultures.

==Other uses==

The term may also be used metaphorically, for example persons may speak of exploring the internet, sexuality, etc.

In scientific research, exploration is one of three purposes of research (the other two being description and explanation). Exploration is the attempt to develop an initial, rough understanding of some phenomenon.
