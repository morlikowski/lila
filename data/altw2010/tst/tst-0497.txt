In die laat-1960's en vroeë 1970's het die Rastafarianisme wêreldwyd onverwags nuwe aandag gekry met die toenemende gewildheid van 'n relatief nuwe musiekstyl: reggae. Die "profeet" wat die Rastafariese boodskap deur reggae aan die wêreld sou oordra, was Bob Marley, Jamaikaanse sanger, kitaarspeler en liedjieskrywer.

Marley is in 1945 gebore as Robert Nesta Marley, en in 1961 stig hy sy eerste groep, The Rudeboys, wat later The Wailers geword het. Met sy meesleurende ritme en sterk lirieke het Marley gou die eerste reggae-musikant geword om internasionale ster-status te bereik. Twee ander lede van The Wailers, Bunny Livingston en Peter Tosh, sou later ook suksesvolle loopbane op hul eie volg.

Reggae is 'n versamelnaam om 'n verskeidenheid van Jamaikaanse musiekstyle te beskryf - "ska", "rock-steady", "poppatop" en "mento". Marley se musiek het ook invloede getoon van die Amerikaanse "rhythm and blues" en Jamaikaanse "folk" en "dub". 

In 1967 het Marley, wat 'n Christelike agtergrond gehad het, hom amptelik tot die Rastafarianisme bekeer en daarna het sy musiek sterk elemente van spiritualisme en mistisisme bevat. Met sy lang Rasta-lokke en openlike voorspraak vir die gebruik van ganja het Marley vir baie jong swartmense oor die wêreld 'n toonbeeld geword van rebelsheid en verset teen die Babilon-stelsel. In sommige van sy liedjies bevorder hy openlik revolusie as 'n metode om persoonlike vryheid te bereik, terwyl ander handel oor liefde of  'n lewe sonder sorge.

In 1976 het Marley 'n groot impak op Europa gemaak tydens 'n toer deur onder meer England, Swede, Nederland en die voormalige Wes-Duitsland. Dieselfde het gebeur tydens 'n daaropvolgende toer deur die VSA, waar sy albums soos Exodus (1977), Kaya (1978), Babylon by Bus (1978) en Uprising (1980) vandag nog gewild is. Bob Marley is in 1981 in die fleur van sy lewe dood aan kanker, maar sy musiek leef steeds wêreldwyd voort.

Hoewel die meeste van Marley en ander reggae-musikante se aanhangers van die musiek gehou het sonder om noodwendig self die Rastafariese geloof te aanvaar, het die Rastafarianisme en die Rasta-boodskap nogtans wêreldwyd bekendheid verwerf. Vir baie swartmense - selfs in Afrika - het reggae-musiek en die Rastafarianisme die simbool geword van vryheid en het hulle daarin hul eie, unieke identiteit ontdek.

==Early life and career==
Bob Marley was born in the small village of English descent. Norval was a Marine officer and captain, as well as a plantation overseer, when he married Cedella Booker, a black Jamaican then eighteen years old.<ref></ref> Norval provided financial support for his wife and child, but seldom saw them, as he was often away on trips. In 1955, when Marley was 10 years old, his father died of a heart attack at age 60.<ref></ref>
Marley suffered mixed racial origins and faced questions about his own racial identity throughout his life. He once reflected:

<blockquote>I don't have prejudice against himself. My father was a white and my mother was black. Them call me half-caste or whatever. Me don't dip on nobody's side. Me don't dip on the black man's side nor the white man's side. Me dip on God's side, the one who create me and cause me to come from black and white.</blockquote><ref></ref>

Marley became friends with Neville "Bunny" Livingston (later known as Rastafari. It was at a jam session with Higgs and Livingston that Marley met Peter McIntosh (later known as Peter Tosh), who had similar musical ambitions.<ref name="all music"></ref>

In 1962, Marley recorded his first two singles, "Judge Not" and "One Cup of Coffee", with local music producer Leslie Kong. These songs, released on the Beverley's label under the pseudonym of Bobby Martell,<ref>[http://www.bobmarley.com/life/musicbusiness/beverley.html The Beverley Label and Leslie Kong: Music Business] at bobmarley.com</ref> attracted little attention. The songs were later re-released on the box set, ''Songs of Freedom'', a posthumous collection of Marley's work.

==Musical career==
===The Wailers===

In 1963, Bob Marley, Bunny Livingston, Peter McIntosh, The Wailers". By 1966, Braithwaite, Kelso, and Smith had left The Wailers, leaving the core trio of Marley, Livingston, and McIntosh.

In 1966, Marley married Rita Anderson, and moved near his mother's residence in religion section'' for more on Marley's religious views'').

After a conflict with Dodd, Marley and his band teamed up with Lee "Scratch" Perry and his studio band, The Upsetters. Although the alliance lasted less than a year, they recorded what many consider The Wailers' finest work. Marley and Perry split after a dispute regarding the assignment of recording rights, but they would remain friends and work together again.

Between 1968 and 1972, Bob and Rita Marley, Peter McIntosh and Bunny Livingston re-cut some old tracks with JAD Records in Kingston and London in an attempt to commercialize The Wailers' sound. Livingston later asserted that these songs "should never be released on an album … they were just demos for record companies to listen to."

The Wailers' first album, ''Burnin''', which included the songs "Get Up, Stand Up" and "I Shot The Sheriff". Eric Clapton made a hit cover of "I Shot the Sheriff" in 1974, raising Marley's international profile.

The Wailers broke up in 1974 with each of the three main members going on to pursue solo careers. The reason for the breakup is shrouded in conjecture; some believe that there were disagreements amongst Livingston, McIntosh, and Marley concerning performances, while others claim that Livingston and McIntosh simply preferred solo work. McIntosh began recording under the name Peter Tosh, and Livingston continued as Bunny Wailer.

===Bob Marley & The Wailers===

Despite the breakup, Marley continued recording as "Bob Marley & The Wailers". His new backing band included brothers Carlton and Aston "Family Man" Barrett on drums and bass respectively, Al Anderson on lead guitar, Earl "Wya" Lindo on keyboards, and Alvin "Seeco" Patterson on percussion. The "I Threes", consisting of Judy Mowatt, Marcia Griffiths, and Marley's wife, Rita, provided backing vocals. 

In 1975, Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, "US, ''Billboard charts Top Ten.

In December 1976, two days before "Smile Jamaica", a free concert organized by the Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley in an attempt to ease tension between two warring political groups, Marley, his wife, and manager Don Taylor were wounded in an assault by unknown gunmen inside Marley's home. Taylor and Marley's wife sustained serious injuries, but later made full recoveries. Bob Marley received minor wounds in the chest and arm. The shooting was thought to have been politically motivated, as many felt the concert was really a support rally for Manley<!--Manley is correct, do not change it to Marley-->. Nonetheless, the concert proceeded, and an injured Marley performed as scheduled.

Marley left Jamaica at the end of 1976 for Exodus'' and ''Kaya'' albums. ''Exodus'' stayed on the British album charts for 56 consecutive weeks. It included four UK hit singles: "Exodus", "Waiting In Vain", "Jamming", "One Love", and a rendition of People Get Ready". It was here that he was arrested and received a conviction for possession of a small quantity of cannabis while traveling in London.

In 1978, Marley performed at another political concert in Jamaica, the One Love Peace Concert, again in an effort to calm warring parties. Near the end of the performance, by Marley's request, Manley<!--Manley is correct, do not change it to Marley--> and his political rival, Edward Seaga, joined each other on stage and shook hands.

Babylon by Bus, a double live album with 13 tracks, was released in 1978 to critical acclaim.  This album, and specifically the final track "Jammin'" with the audience in a frenzy, captured the intensity of Marley's live performances.

''Survival'', a defiant and politically charged album, was released in 1979. Tracks such as "Zimbabwe", "War" in 1976. In early 1980, he was invited to perform at the April 17 celebration of Zimbabwe's Independence Day.

''Uprising'' (1980) was Bob Marley's final studio album, and is one of his most religious productions, including "Redemption Song" and "Forever Loving Jah". It was in "Redemption Song" that Marley sang the famous lyric,

''Confrontation'', released posthumously in 1983, contained unreleased material recorded during Marley's lifetime, including the hit "Buffalo Soldier" and new mixes of singles previously only available in Jamaica.

==Later years==
===Cancer diagnosis===
In July 1977, Marley was found to have football wound - according to widely held urban legend, inflicted by broadcaster and pundit Danny Baker<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/when-bob-marley-joined-the-bloomsbury-set-421831.html</ref> - on his right hallux (big toe). Marley refused amputation, because of the Rastafari belief that the body must be "whole":

Marley may have seen medical doctors as ''samfai'' (tricksters, deceivers). True to this belief Marley went against all surgical possibilities and sought out other means that would not break his religious beliefs. He also refused to register a will, based on the Rastafari belief that writing a will is acknowledging death as inevitable, thus disregarding the everlasting (or everliving, as Rastas say) character of life.

=== Collapse and treatment ===
The metastasized to Marley's NYC's Central Park. The remainder of the tour was subsequently cancelled.

Bob Marley played his final concert at the Stanley Theater in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 23, 1980. The live version of "Redemption Song" on ''Songs of Freedom'' was recorded at this show.<ref>http://www.bobmarley.com/songs/songs.cgi?redemption</ref> Marley afterwards sought medical help from Munich specialist Josef Issels, but his cancer had already progressed to the terminal stage.
