'''''The Tailor of Gloucester''''' is a children's novel by Beatrix Potter that was first published in October 1903.<ref></ref> It is traditionally read to children on Christmas eve, just before bed time.<ref></ref>

==Origins==
The story tells of a tailor who falls ill and is unable to complete an important commission. When he returns to his shop, however, it is to find the waistcoat completed, apart from a button-hole because there is "no more twist". The work has been done by mice who are grateful because the tailor rescued them from his cat.

Potter had heard of this story while visiting a cousin, Caroline Hutton, though in fact the work had been secretly done by the tailor's very human assistants.<ref>''The Complete Tales of Beatrix Potter'', published by F. Warne & Co., 1989</ref>

==Synopsis==

This book tells the story of a poor tailor, his cat, and the mice that live in his shop.  He has many scraps of cloth and ribbons left over that are too small for any practical use.  The mice take these and make fine clothes for themselves.  

The tailor sends his cat Simpkin to buy food and a twist of cherry-coloured silk for a coat the mayor has commissioned for his wedding, which will take place on Christmas morning.

While the cat is gone, he frees the mice from teacups where Simpkin has imprisoned them.  When Simpkin returns and finds his mice gone, he hides the twist in anger.  

When the tailor falls ill, the mice save the day by completing the coat.  (One buttonhole remains incomplete because the mice run out of twist).
