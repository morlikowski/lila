'''Viking Fotballklubb''' is a Norwegian football club from the city of Norwegian Premier Football League titles, most recently in 1991, and 5 domestic cup titles, most recently in 2001. The club has played and won more top-flight league games than any other club, and it has played in the top division since the league was established, except for the years 1966-67 and 1987-88. Notable European successes include knocking English giants Chelsea out of the Sporting Portugal from the same tournament in 1999-2000, and qualifying for the group stages of the UEFA Cup 2005-06.

==History==
Viking was founded in Norway's 1936 olympic team. His brother Norway, while Bernhard Lund later went on to write the club anthem. 

After the Sandefjord in the 1959 final, as well as the league title in 1958. Long-serving goalkeeper Norway. Rolf and Odd 4-0 in the cup semifinal.

While the 1960s was a somewhat quieter decade for Viking, the club returned to dominate Norwegian football in the 1970s. Viking won four straight league titles from 1972 to 1975, as well as the double in 1979. Innovative 1972 manager Kjell Schou Andreassen has been credited for laying the foundation for the success, with his ideas on cooperative behaviour and his revolutionary use of pacey, attacking full backs Sigbjørn Slinning and Anbjørn Ekeland. However, the team had a new manager every year, with Sverre Andersen, Stewart Williams and Olav Nilsen leading them to the title in the subsequent years, and Tony Knapp managing the 1979 team. Midfielder Olav Nilsen was also a crucial player on the pitch in the first half of the decade, earning the nickname "Olav Viking", while fellow midfielder Svein Kvia was awarded the Norwegian Player of the Year title on several occasions. Reidar Goa, Hans Edgar Paulsen, Erik Johannessen, Inge Valen, Johannes Vold, Svein Hammerø, Gunnar Berland and Trygve Johannessen were other key players.

The 1980s started well for the club. Kjell Schou Andreassen returned to guide the club to the league title in 1982. They also finished runners-up in the league in 1981 and 1984, and in the cup in 1984, producing players such as Bjarne Berntsen, Per Henriksen, Erik Thorstvedt, Svein Fjælberg, Nils Ove Hellvik, Tonning Hammer, Isak Arne Refvik, Torbjørn Svendsen, Trygve Johannessen and Gary Goodchild. However, the mid-80s saw the club relegated to the second division, and 1987 was the club's worst season in recent memory as the club fell to 8th position in the Second Division, while local rivals Bryne F.K. won the cup and neighbouring minnows F.K. Vidar almost won promotion to the Premier League.

Something had to be done, and the solution was a massive financial gamble which saw Swedish manager Benny Lennartsson and players Kjell Jonevret and Per Holmberg arrive on large salaries. The gamble paid off when charismatic striker Alf Kåre Tveit secured a controversial penalty in the 95th minute against Vard in the final league game of the 1988 season. Arild Ravndal converted the spot kick to give Viking the victory and secure promotion, dubbed "the miracle in Haugesund". This signalled the start of a new era, and the club won the cup in 1989 and the league in 1991. Lars Gaute Bø, Roger Nilsen, Kent Christiansen, Egil Fjetland, Jan Fjetland, Trond Egil Soltvedt, Mike McCabe, Børre Meinseth were other key players in a young Viking team.

However, many of the young players from the 1991 league winning squad did not manage to live up to their expectations, and the club was almost relegated under new manager Magnus Svensson, Bjarte Aarsheim, Kenneth Storvik, Roger Nilsen and Ingve Bøe were other key players in this generation.

Chelsea. In 2003, Kjell Inge Olsen took over as manager, and the club finished fifth in the league. 

At the beginning of the 2004 season, the club moved to its new stadium in Finland manager, and he was replaced by Tom Prahl. 
    
The 2006 season started poorly for Prahl's team and poor soon turned to terrible. With seven matches to go, the once so feared team were situated at the bottom of the table. Something had to be done and the former Start coach Brann 5-0 at home to pass both Odd Grenland in the standings and ultimately retain their spot in the Premier League. Tom Nordlie was considered the favorite for the manager role after the season, but he chose a move to rivals Lillestrøm instead. On November 22nd, Viking signed Uwe Rösler (who was replaced by Tom Nordlie in Lillestrøm just one week earlier) as their new manager.

Under Rösler, Viking returned as a top team, and claimed the 3rd spot on the table in 2007.
