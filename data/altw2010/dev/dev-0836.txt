'''רומן מפתח''' (בצרפתית: '''roman à clef''') הוא מונח המציין סוגה של רומן או נובלה, שבה מתוארים אירועי חיים אמיתיים, מאחורי העמדת פנים של סיפור בדיוני. 

ה"מפתח", שאינו מוצג בטקסט עצמו, הוא ההתאמה הקיימת בין האירועים, המאפיינים או הדמויות שביצירה הספרותית, לבין אלה הקיימים במציאות. 

קיימות מספר סיבות שבעטיין יבחר המחבר בסוגת "רומן המפתח": 
* סאטירה
* כתיבה על נושאים שנויים במחלוקת, סקנדל או מחדל, בלי רצון מצד המחבר לשים תווית ו"לקרוא לילד בשמו".
* הזדמנות מצד המחבר לתאר השתלשלות עניינים של מציאות קיימת, או שהייתה יכולה להתקיים, באופן שונה, שיעביר מסר או שיוביל את הקורא למוסר השכל. 

רומן מפתח שעורר סערה בישראל עם פרסומו הוא ספרה של הדסה מור, "דרכים לוהטות", שבו תואר בפירוט רב רומן בין הגיבורה ובין איש צבא, האלוף הגידם "מתי יניב", בן דמותו של משה דיין.

A '''''roman à clef''''' or '''''roman à clé''''' (French for "novel with a key") is a novel describing real-life behind a façade of fiction. The 'key' is usually a famous figure or, in some cases, the author.

The reasons an author might choose the ''roman à clef'' format include:
* Satire
* Writing about controversial topics and/or reporting inside information on scandals without giving rise to charges of libel
* The opportunity to turn the tale the way the author would like it to have gone
* The opportunity to portray personal, autobiographical experiences without having to expose the author as the subject

Since its original use in the context of writings, the ''roman à clef'' technique is also used in the theatre and in movies, such as ''Citizen Kane'', a thinly-veiled biopic about William Randolph Hearst. Victor Hugo's banned play, ''Le Roi s'amuse'', the basis for the opera ''Rigoletto'', and more recently ''Dreamgirls'', a musical based on the career of The Supremes, are examples from the theatre.
