== Stadium history ==
=== Conception and construction ===

Dolphin Stadium was the first of its kind to be constructed entirely with private funds. Joe Robbie led the financing campaign to build Joe Robbie Stadium (JRS) for the Miami Dolphins of the NFL. JRS revolutionized the economics of professional sports when it opened in 1987. Inclusion of a Club Level, along with Executive Suites, helped to finance the construction of the stadium. Season ticket holders committed to long term agreements and in return they received first-class amenities in a state-of-the-art facility.

The stadium was designed at Joe Robbie's request to have a wider than normal playing field in order to accommodate South Florida. Because of this design decision, the first row of seats is 90 feet (27 m) from the sideline in a football configuration, considerably more distant than the first row of seats in most football stadia (the closest seats at the new Soldier Field, for instance, are 55 feet (17 m) from the sideline at the 50-yard line). While the decision to employ a wider playing field resulted in a Major League Baseball (MLB) expansion franchise for Miami (see below), it resulted in a less intimate venue for football when compared to other contemporary football facilities.

=== The Marlins move in ===

In 1990, H. Wayne Huizenga, then Chairman of the Board and CEO of Blockbuster Video and Huizenga Holdings Inc., agreed to purchase 50 percent of Joe Robbie Stadium and became the point man in the drive to bring July 1991, when South Florida was awarded an MLB expansion franchise. The new team was named the Florida Marlins and placed in the National League. On 24 January 1994, Huizenga acquired the remaining fifty percent of the stadium to give him 100% ownership. Since 1991, several million dollars have been spent to upgrade and renovate the stadium.

=== Notable sporting events and concerts held ===

The stadium has been home to the 1987 and to the Florida and Syracuse, which had to be moved due to a conflict with a Dolphins playoff game. The stadium has played host to: four 1997 and 2003), and numerous concerts, featuring entertainers such as Chicago, Genesis, Madonna on Nov 26, 2008.

The stadium was the venue where Ken Griffey, Jr. hit his 600th career home run off Mark Hendrickson of the Florida Marlins on June 9, 2008.

=== Other events held ===

Other events held at Dolphin Stadium have included international soccer matches, Monster Truck shows, Hoop-It-Up Basketball, RV and Boat Shows, the UniverSoul Circus, and Australian rules football exhibition matches and numerous trade shows. The Stadium also plays host bi-annually to the yearly Shula Bowl, a game played between Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University, when the game is hosted by FAU (FIU hosts the game at their own stadium, FIU Stadium, every other year). In 2006, Dolphin Stadium hosted the High School State Football Championships, sanctioned by the FHSAA Florida High School Athletic Association.

== Renovations for the Florida Marlins ==

Behind the scenes, the facility underwent $100&nbsp;million in renovations to accommodate Major League Baseball and the Florida Marlins before the 1993 season. Purists feared the result would be similar to Exhibition Stadium in Toronto; when the Toronto Blue Jays played there from 1976 to 1989, they were burdened with seats that were so far from the field that they weren't even sold during the regular season. However, as mentioned above, Robbie had foreseen Miami would be a likely location for an expansion major league baseball team, and the stadium was designed to make any necessary renovations for baseball as seamless as possible.

The conversion included the installation of retractable seating on the north side of the stadium (with the stands that were removed installed as seating at the Dolphins training camp facility), the construction of the baseball press box in the southwest corner of the facility, the building of the baseball dugouts, the addition of 660 new lights for suitable night play and the installation of a hydraulic disappearing pitcher's mound. The stadium also features a synthetic warning track designed to absorb water. At the time, the only other facility to feature this type of track was Oriole Park at Camden Yards, home of the Baltimore Orioles. The renovation also included the construction of the Florida Marlins clubhouse and other amenities to accommodate baseball at the stadium.

The stadium's capacity for baseball was reduced to just over 47,600 seats. Even without the Marlins' desire for a more intimate atmosphere, most of the upper-deck outfield seats would have been too far from the field. The stadium's baseball capacity has been reduced even further in recent years, and it now seats just over 36,500. However, for the two times (1997 and 2003) the stadium has hosted the World Series, the 400 section in the outfield was uncovered, giving the Marlins an average attendance of over 66,000 for those seven home games.

Because of the need to fit a football field in the stadium, the field of play is larger than in most other new baseball stadiums. The distance to straightaway center, , is the second deepest in the majors (only Minute Maid Park is deeper at 436), however, research suggests that this distance may be exaggerated by 10 feet or so. The 33-foot (10 m) tall left field fence, nicknamed the "Teal Monster" further limits the ability of players to hit home runs. Foul territory is also fairly large in comparison with most new stadiums.

Since winning the World Series in 1997, Marlins' management has regularly argued that the stadium is insufficient to host an MLB team on a regular basis, largely due to the fact that current team management does not own any part of Dolphin Stadium (owned by Huizenga), and therefore are not able to take in any money from parking, concessions or the like. The Marlins also ran into problems during the 2003 World Series when the turf conversion between the Marlins and Dolphins games provided an unsteady playing surface for football. Also, most believe a retractable dome is needed to prevent rain-outs. The stadium did not prevent the team from winning a second world championship in 2003, however.

On the field, the stadium is equipped with a Prescription Athletic Turf (PAT) system which provides draining for its natural grass. At a cost of $1&nbsp;million, the system ensures a firm, dry playing surface within half an hour's time after as much as a three inches (76 mm)  per hour rain fall.

Like the Metrodome, Dolphin Stadium is not a true multipurpose stadium, but is a football stadium that can convert into a baseball stadium. Most of the seats are pointed toward center field - where the 50-yard line would be in the football configuration. As such, the sight lines are not as good for baseball. During the Marlins' two World Series appearances, most fans sitting in the upper-deck seats in left field were unable to see much of left and center field (areas that are not part of the football playing field) except on the replay boards.

Due to all the problems such as that, the Florida Marlins are booked for a new home in 2011, moving to the Miami Orange Bowl site at their new home (New Marlins Stadium).
