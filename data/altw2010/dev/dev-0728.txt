'''John Anthony Bellairs''' (gothic mystery novels for young adults featuring Lewis Barnavelt, Anthony Monday, and Johnny Dixon.

==Biography==
After earning degrees at UK, and studying history and Latin. His favorite authors included Charles Dickens, Henry James, C. V. Wedgwood, and Garrett Mattingly, as well as M.R. James, from whose ghost stories he occasionally borrowed elements to work into his own fiction.

His first published work, ''St. Fidgeta and Other Parodies'', was a collection of short stories satirizing the rites and rituals of Catholicism; the book remains out of print. ''The Pedant and the Shuffly'', his second book, was a short, illustrated fable detailing the chaotic encounter of the two title characters; originally published in 1968, it was reissued in paperback in 2001.

Bellairs undertook ''The Face in the Frost'' while living in Britain and after reading J. R. R. Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings''; in the upshot, it is not much like that book, save for the fact that it shares the idea of a wizard who is palpably human and not a literary stereotype. Bellairs said of his third book: "''The Face in the Frost'' was an attempt to write in the Tolkien manner. I was much taken by ''The Lord of the Rings'' and wanted to do a modest work on those lines. In reading the latter book I was struck by the fact that Gandalf was not much of a person—just a good guy. So I gave Prospero, my wizard, most of my phobias and crotchets. It was simply meant as entertainment and any profundity will have to be read in." Writing in 1973, Lin Carter described ''The Face in the Frost'' as one of the three best fantasy novels to appear since ''The Lord of the Rings''. Carter stated that Bellairs was planning a sequel to ''The Face in the Frost'' at the time.<ref>Lin Carter, ''Imaginary Worlds''. New York: Ballantine/Random House, 1973 (Cites Carter's correspondence with Bellairs).</ref>

''The House with a Clock in Its Walls'' (1973), Bellairs's next novel, was originally composed as a contemporary adult fantasy, but at the time there was little market for such a thing. The second publisher to which it was submitted suggested rewriting it as a young readers' book; Bellairs did so, and thus determined the future course of his career. While his following books were all good-to-excellent of kind, his earlier adult work suggests to many that—not for the first or the last time—the world was deprived by economic stringencies of some works of excellence. Bellairs wound up writing 15 young-adult novels.

Two books, ''The House with a Clock in its Walls'' and ''German, French, Japanese and Polish, among others.

===Death and afterward===
Bellairs died of cardiovascular disease at his home in Haverhill, Massachusetts, in 1991. He was 53 years old.

At the time of his death he left behind two unfinished manuscripts and two one-page synopses for future adventures. Author 1996 with ''The Hand of the Necromancer'', Strickland began writing his own stories based on the established characters. In Marshall, noting that the imposing Italianate mansion was the basis for his book. Bellairs was inducted posthumously into the Haverhill Hall of Fame in 2000.

Rumors of a full-fledged motion picture adaptation of ''The House with a Clock in Its Walls'', as well as other titles, have been exchanged online for years; to date, there is no official release date set for any movie.

Brad Strickland announced in spring 2005 that new adventures of the Bellairs characters were under way, following contract negotiations with the Bellairs estate and a two-year absence since his last-published novel. The first of these new adventures was ''The House Where Nobody Lived'', released on 5 October, 2006.
