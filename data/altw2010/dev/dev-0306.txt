'''Nauru''' , officially the '''Republic of Nauru''', is an South Pacific. The nearest neighbour is Republic of Kiribati, 300 km due east. Nauru is the world's smallest island nation, covering just 21&nbsp;km² (8.1&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi), the smallest independent republic, and the only republican state in the world without an official capital.<ref name="CIA">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nr.html CIA World Fact Book] URL accessed 2006-05-02.</ref> It is the least populous member of the United Nations.

Initially inhabited by Germany in the late 19th century, and became a mandate territory administered by Japan during World War II, and after the war entered into trusteeship again. Nauru achieved independence in 1968.

Nauru is a detention centre that held and processed asylum seekers trying to enter Australia.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7229764.stm BBC News: Australia ends 'Pacific Solution']</ref>

==History==

Nauru was first inhabited by Micronesian and Polynesian people at least 3,000 years ago.<ref name="UNCCD">Nauru Department of Economic Development and Environment. 2003. [http://www.unccd.int/cop/reports/asia/national/2002/nauru-eng.pdf First National Report To the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)] URL Accessed 2006-05-03</ref> There were traditionally 12 clans or tribes on Nauru, which are represented in the 12-pointed star in the nation's flag. The English speakers could easily pronounce the name. Nauruans traced their descent on the female side. Naurans subsisted on pandanus fruit, and caught juvenile ''ibija'' fish, acclimated them to fresh water conditions and raised them in Buada Lagoon, providing an additional reliable source of food.<ref>McDaniel, C.

thumb|left|Nauru annexed in 1888 by Germany.
The island was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany's Marshall Islands Protectorate; they called the island Nawodo or Onawero. The arrival of the Germans ended the war; social changes brought about by the war established Kings as rulers of the island, the most widely known being King Auweyida. Christian missionaries from the Gilbert Islands also arrived at the island in 1888.<ref>Ellis, A. F. 1935. ''Ocean Island and Nauru - their story''. Angus and Robertson Limited. pp 29–39</ref> The Germans ruled Nauru for almost 3 decades.

Phosphate was discovered on the island in 1900 by prospector Albert Ellis and the Pacific Phosphate Company started to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany; they exported their first shipment in 1907.<ref>Ellis, A. F. 1935. ''Ocean Island and Nauru - their story''. Angus and Robertson Limited. pp 127–139</ref> Following the outbreak of World War I, the island was captured by Australian forces in 1914. After the war, the League of Nations gave Australia a trustee mandate over Nauru; the UK and New Zealand were also co-trustees.<ref>Cain, Timothy M., comp. "Nauru." The Book of Rule. 1st ed. 1 vols.

Nauru became self-governing in January 1966, and following a two-year constitutional convention, became independent in 1968, led by founding president Hammer DeRoburt. In 1967, the people of Nauru purchased the assets of the British Phosphate Commissioners, and in June 1970, control passed to the locally owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation. Income from the exploitation of phosphate gave Nauruans one of the highest living standards in the Pacific and per capita, in the world.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7296832.stm Nauru seeks to regain lost fortunes] Nick Squires, 2008-03-15, BBC News Online.

In 1989, the country took legal action against Australia in the International Court of Justice over Australia's actions during its administration of Nauru, in particular, Australia's failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining.<ref>Highet, K and Kahale, H. 1993. Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru. ''The American Journal of International Law'' 87:282–288</ref> The action led to an out-of-court settlement to rehabilitate the mined-out areas of Nauru. Diminishing phosphate reserves has led to economic decline in Nauru, which has brought increasing political instability since the mid-1980s. Nauru had 17 changes of administration between 1989 and 2003.<ref name="DFAT">Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Dowiyogo died in office in March 2003 and Ludwig Scotty was elected President. Scotty was re-elected to serve a full term in October 2004. Following a vote of no confidence by Parliament against President Scotty on 19 December 2007, Marcus Stephen became president.

In recent times, a significant proportion of the country's income has been in the form of aid from Australia.

Nauru is a government. An 18-member Democratic Party, Centre Party. The fact that Nauru is a democracy makes Nauru a rare and atypical counterexample of the traditional theory of the rentier state, as the sale of Nauru's natural resource has not led to authoritarianism.<ref name="Kirkpatrick 2006">Kirkpatrick, Andrew.

Since 1992, local government has been the responsibility of the Nauru Island Council (NIC). The NIC has limited powers and functions as an advisor to the national government on local matters. The role of the NIC is to concentrate its efforts on local activities relevant to Nauruans. An elected member of the Nauru Island Council cannot simultaneously be a member of parliament.<ref>Ogden, M.R.

Nauru has a complex legal system. The Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice, is paramount on constitutional issues. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions, but Appellate Court rulings can be appealed to the High Court of Australia;<ref>''Nauru (High Court Appeals)'' Act (Australia) 1976.

Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. Finally, there also are two quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.<ref name="State Department">[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/16447.htm State Department Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs September 2005] URL Accessed 2006-05-11</ref></small>

Following independence in 1968, Nauru joined the Commonwealth as a Special Member, and became a full member in 2000.<ref name="UN">[http://www.un.int/nauru/overview.html Republic of Nauru Permanent Mission to the United Nations] URL Accessed 2006-05-10</ref></small> Nauru was admitted to the Asian Development Bank in 1991 and to the UN in 1999. It is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, the South Pacific Regional Environmental Program, the South Pacific Commission, and the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission. The US Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program operates a climate-monitoring facility on the island.

Nauru and Australia have close diplomatic ties. In addition to informal defence arrangements, the September 2005 Memorandum of Understanding between the two countries provides Nauru with financial aid and technical assistance, including a Secretary of Finance to prepare Nauru's budget, and advisers on health and education. This aid is in return for Nauru's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed.<ref name="DFAT">Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. [http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/nauru/nauru_brief.html Republic of Nauru Country Brief - November 2005] URL accessed on 2006-05-02.</ref> Nauru uses the Australian dollar as its official currency.

Nauru has used its position as a member of the UN to gain financial support from both US$60 million in aid. In response, Taiwan severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later. Nauru later re-established links with Taiwan on 14 May 2005,<ref>AAP. May 14, 2005. [http://taiwansecurity.org/AFP/2005/AFP-140505.htm Taiwan Re-establishes Diplomatic Ties with Nauru] URL Accessed 2006-05-05</ref> and diplomatic ties with China were officially severed on 31 May 2005; however, the PRC continues to maintain a diplomatic presence in the island nation.

== Geography ==

thumb|right|Aiwo
Nauru is a small, oval-shaped island in the western Pacific Ocean, 42 km (26 mi.) south of the canals have been made in the reef to allow small boats to access the island. A 150&ndash;300 m (about 500&ndash;1000 ft.) wide fertile coastal strip lies landward from the beach. Coral cliffs surround the central plateau, which is known on the island as Topside. The highest point of the plateau is 65 m (213 ft) above sea level. The only fertile areas are the narrow coastal belt, where pandanus trees and indigenous hardwoods such as the tomano tree are cultivated. The population of the island is concentrated in this coastal belt and around Buada Lagoon.

Nauru was one of three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean (the others are Banaba (Ocean Island) in Kiribati and Makatea in French Polynesia); however, the phosphate reserves are nearly depleted. Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to 15 m (49 ft) high. A century of mining has stripped and devastated four-fifths of the land area. Mining has also had an impact on the surrounding Exclusive Economic Zone with 40% of marine life considered to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff.<ref name = "climate">Republic of Nauru. 1999. [http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf Climate Change Response Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] URL accessed 2006-05-03.</ref>

There are limited natural fresh water resources on Nauru. Roof storage tanks collect rainwater, but islanders are mostly dependent on a single, aging desalination plant. Nauru's climate is hot and extremely humid year-round, because of the proximity of the land to the climate and sea level change, but to what degree is difficult to predict; at least 80% of the land area of Nauru is well elevated, but this area will be uninhabitable until the phosphate mining rehabilitation program is implemented.<ref name = "climate">Republic of Nauru. 1999. [http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf Climate Change Response Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] URL Accessed 2006-05-03</ref>

There are only sixty recorded endemic.

The Polynesian Rat, cats, dogs, pigs and chickens have been introduced to the island.

== Economy ==

Nauru's economy depends almost entirely on declining phosphate deposits; there are few other resources, and most necessities are imported.<ref name="Mining">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/332164.stm Big tasks for a small island] URL Accessed 2006-05-10</ref></small> Small-scale mining is still conducted by the NPC. The government places a percentage of the NPC's earnings in the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. The Trust manages long-term investments, intended to support the citizens once the phosphate reserves have been exhausted. However, a history of bad investments, financial mismanagement, overspending and corruption has reduced the Trust's fixed and Air Nauru's only Boeing 737-400 was repossessed in December 2005 - though the aircraft was replaced in June of the next year with a Boeing 737-300 model, and normal service was resumed by the company.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/17/1082140116981.html?from=storyrhs Receivers take over Nauru House].

In the 1990s, Nauru became a Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) then identified Nauru as one of 15 "non-cooperative" countries in its fight against money laundering. Under pressure from FATF, Nauru introduced anti-avoidance legislation in 2003, following which foreign hot money flowed out of the country. In October 2005, this legislation—and its effective enforcement—led the FATF to lift the non-cooperative designation.<ref>FATF. October 13, 2005.

From 2001 to 2007, the Nauru detention centre provided a source of income for the small country. The Nauruan authorities reacted with concern to its closure by Australia.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/nauru-fears-gap-when-camps-close/2007/12/10/1197135374481.html "Nauru fears gap when camps close"], Jewel Topsfield, ''The Age'', December 11, 2007</ref> In February 2008, foreign affairs minister Dr. Kieren Keke stated that it would result in 100 Nauruans losing their jobs, and would affect 10% of the island's population directly or indirectly:
:''"We have got a huge number of families that are suddenly going to be without any income. We are looking at ways we can try and provide some welfare assistance but our capacity to do that is very limited. Literally we have got a major unemployment crisis in front of us."''<ref>[http://news.theage.com.au/nauru-hit-by-detention-centre-closure/20080207-1qs6.html "Nauru 'hit' by detention centre closure"], ''The Age'', February 7, 2008</ref>
