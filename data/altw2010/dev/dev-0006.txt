The '''Giant Otter''' (''Pteronura brasiliensis'') is an amphibious, mammalian active during daylight hours. It is the noisiest otter species and distinct vocalizations have been documented that indicate alarm, aggressiveness, and reassurance.

The Giant Otter ranges across north-central South America, although its distribution has been greatly reduced and is now discontinuous. The species was listed as endangered in 1999 and population estimates are typically below 5,000 in the wild. The Guianas are the last real stronghold for the species. Decades of poaching for its velvety pelt, peaking in the 1950s and 1960s, decimated population numbers. Habitat degradation and loss is the greatest current threat. The Giant Otter is also rare in captivity: as of 2003, only 60 animals were held.<ref name=Cali>{{cite journal |last=Londono |first=G. Corredor |coauthors=Munoz, N.

The Giant Otter shows a variety of adaptations suitable to an amphibious lifestyle, including exceptionally dense fur, a wing-like tail, and webbed feet. The species prefers freshwater rivers and streams, which are usually seasonally flooded, and may also take to freshwater lakes and springs. It constructs extensive campsites close to feeding areas, clearing large amounts of vegetation. The Giant Otter largely subsists on a diet of fish, particularly characins and catfish, and may also take crabs. It has no serious natural predators, although it must compete with other species, including the Neotropical Otter and caiman species, for food resources.

==Naming==
The Giant Otter has a handful of other names in English. '''River Wolf''' (Spanish: ''Lobo del Río'') and '''Water Dog''' (Spanish: ''Perro del Agua'') are used occasionally. The last of these may have been more common in the reports of explorers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<ref> See e.g., Duplaix, pg. 547.</ref> All three names are in use in Spanish and Portuguese, with a number of regional variations. "Giant Otter" translates as ''Nutria Gigante'' and ''Lontra Gigante'' in Spanish and Portuguese, respectively; a fourth name, ''Ariraí'' or ''Ariranha'' is also in use in South America.<ref name=FAO/>  Among the Achuar people, they are known as ''Wankanim'',<ref name=Descola/> and among the Sanumá as ''Hadami''.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The genus name, '''''Pteronura''''', is derived from the Ancient Greek words ''pteron''/πτερον 'feather' or 'wing' and ''ura''/ουρά 'tail',<ref name="Liddell 1980"></ref> a reference to its distinctive wing-like tail.<ref name=Koepfli/>

==Taxonomy and evolution==

The otters form the Amazon, and Guianas river systems; to the south, ''P. b. paraguensis'' has been suggested in morphology. Carter and Rosas, however, rejected the subspecific division in 1997, noting that the classification had only been validated once, in 1968, and that the ''P. b. paraguensis'' type specimen was very similar to ''P. b. brasiliensis''.<ref name=C4/> Biologist Nicole Duplaix calls the division of "doubtful value."<ref>Duplaix, pg. 511.</ref>

An extinct genus, ''Satherium'', is believed to be ancestral to the present species, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene.<ref name=Koepfli></ref> The Giant Otter shares the South American continent with three of the four members of the ''Lontra'' genus of otters: the Neotropical River Otter, the Southern River Otter, and the Marine Otter.<ref name=actionplan></ref> It seems to have evolved independently of ''Lontra'' in South America, despite the overlap. The Smooth-coated Otter (''Lutrogale perspicillata'') of Asia may be its closest extant relative: similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted.<ref name=Koepfli/> Both species also show strong pair bonding and paternal engagement in rearing cubs.<ref>Duplaix, pg. 614.</ref>

basal divergence among the otters or fall outside of them altogether, having split even before other mustelids, such as the Polecat, and Mink.<ref name=Koepfli/> Later gene sequencing research on the mustelids, from 2005, places the divergence of the Giant Otter somewhat later, between 10.6 and 7 million years ago; the corresponding phylogenetic tree locates the ''Lontra'' divergence first amongst otter genera, and ''Pteronura'' second, although divergence ranges overlap.<ref></ref>

==Biology and behaviour==

The Giant Otter is large, gregarious, and diurnal (active through the day). Early travellers' reports describe noisy groups surrounding explorers' boats but little scientific information was available on the species until Duplaix's groundbreaking work in the late 1970s.<ref>Duplaix, pg. 497.</ref> Concern over this endangered species has since generated a corpus of research.  

=== Physical characteristics ===

The Giant Otter is clearly distinguished from other otters by morphological and behavioural characteristics. It has the greatest body length of any species in the mustelid family, although the Sea Otter may be heavier. Males are between 1.5 and 1.8&nbsp;meters (4.9–5.9&nbsp;feet) in length and females between 1.5 and 1.7&nbsp;m (4.9–5.6&nbsp;ft). Early reports of skins and living animals suggested exceptionally large males of up to 2.4&nbsp;m (7.9&nbsp;ft); intensive hunting likely reduced the occurrence of such massive specimens. Weights are between 32 and 45.3&nbsp;kilograms (70–100&nbsp;pounds) for males and 22 and 26&nbsp;kg (48–57&nbsp;lbs) for females.<ref name=C2>Carter and Rosas, pg. 2.</ref>

The Giant Otter has the shortest fur of all otter species; it is typically chocolate brown but may be reddish or fawn, and appears nearly black when wet.<ref name=C2/> The fur is extremely dense, so much so that water cannot penetrate to the skin.<ref name=Philly></ref> Guard hairs trap water and keep the inner fur dry; the guard hairs are approximately 8&nbsp;millimeters (one third of an inch) in length, about twice as long as the fur of the inner coat.<ref name=Seaworld></ref> Its velvety feel makes the animal highly sought after by fur traders and has contributed to its decline.<ref name=EE></ref> Unique markings of white or cream fur colors the throat and under the chin, allowing individuals to be identified from birth.<ref name=C2/> Its well-muscled tail can account for as much as 69&nbsp;centimeters (27&nbsp;in) of total body length.<ref></ref> 

Giant Otter muzzles are short and sloping and give the head a ball-shaped appearance.<ref name=D511>Duplaix, pg. 511.</ref> The ears are small and rounded.<ref name=Philly/> The nose (or rhinarium) is completely covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The Giant Otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey.<ref name=WWF></ref> The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.<ref></ref>

As of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been directly studied but field observations show that the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, it is able to recognize observers at great distances. The fact that it is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting. In other otter species vision is generally normal or slightly myopic, both on land and in water. Giant Otter hearing is acute and its sense of smell excellent.<ref name=D533>Duplaix, pg. 533.</ref><ref name=C2/>

===Vocalizations===

The Giant Otter is an especially noisy animal, with a complex repertoire of vocalizations. All otters produce vocalizations, but by frequency and volume, the Giant Otter may be the most vocal.<ref></ref> Duplaix identified nine distinct sounds, with further subdivisions possible, depending on context. Quick ''HAH!'' barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger. A wavering scream may be used in bluff charges against intruders, while a low growl is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as advance warning of non-hostile intent between groups, although evidence is limited. Newborn cubs squeak to elicit attention, while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in group activities.<ref>Duplaix, pp. 552–561.</ref>

=== Social structure ===
thumb|right|Giant Otters leave a pool together at the [[Philadelphia Zoo. The species is extremely social, a rarity amongst mustelids, and family groups are cohesive.]]
The Giant Otter is a highly social animal and lives in extended family groups. Group sizes are anywhere from two to twenty members but likely average between three and eight.<ref name=FAO></ref>  (Larger figures may reflect two or three family groups temporarily feeding together.)<ref name=vandamme2002/> The groups are strongly cohesive: the otters sleep, play, travel, and feed together.

Group members share roles, structured around the dominant breeding pair. The species is territorial, with groups marking their ranges with latrines, gland secretions, and vocalizations.<ref name=Ribas05></ref> At least one case of a change in alpha relationship has been reported, with a new male taking over the role; the mechanics of the transition were not determined.<ref name=Evan07/> Duplaix suggests a division between ''residents'', who are established within groups and territories, and nomadic and solitary ''transients''; the categories do not seem rigid, and both may be a normal part of the Giant Otter life cycle.<ref>Duplaix, pp. 571–572.</ref> One tentative theory for the development of sociality in mustelids is that locally abundant but unpredictably dispersed prey causes groups to form.<ref name=Johnson00/> 

Aggression within the species ("intraspecific" conflict) has been documented. Defense against intruding animals appears to be cooperative: while adult males typically lead in aggressive encounters, cases of alpha females guarding groups has been reported.<ref name=Evan07></ref> One fight was directly observed in the Brazilian Pantanal in which three animals violently engaged a single individual near a range boundary.<ref name=Ribas05/> In another instance in Brazil, a carcass was found with clear indications of violent assault by other otters, including bites to the snout and genitals, an attack pattern similar to that exhibited by captive animals.<ref></ref> While not rare amongst large predators in general, intraspecific aggression is uncommon amongst otter species; Ribas and Mourão suggest a correlation to the animal's sociability, which is also rare amongst other otters.<ref name=Ribas05/>
<!--http://iucnosg.org/Bulletin/Volume18/Groenendijk_et_al_2001.html-->A capacity for aggressive behaviour should not be overstated with the Giant Otter. Researchers emphasize that even between groups, conflict avoidance is generally adopted.<ref>Duplaix, pg. 563.</ref><ref name=C15>Carter and Rosas, pg. 15.</ref> Within groups, the animals are extremely peaceful and cooperative. Group hierarchies are not rigid and the animals easily share roles.<ref></ref>

thumb|left|Captive Giant Otters have provided much of the research on the species' reproduction and life cycle.
=== Reproduction and life cycle ===
Details of Giant Otter reproduction and life cycle are scarce, and captive animals have provided much of the information. Females appear to give birth year round, although in the wild births may peak during the dry season. The estrous cycle is 21 days, with females receptive to sexual advances between 3 and 10 days.<ref name=C18>Carter and Rosas, pg. 18.</ref> Study of captive specimens has found that only males initiate copulation.<ref name=Cali/> At Tierpark Hagenbeck in Germany, long-term pair bonding and individualized mate selection were seen, with copulation most frequently taking place in water.<ref name=Germany/> Females have a gestation period of 65 to 70 days, giving birth to one to five pups, with an average of two.<ref name=Germany></ref><ref name=C18/> Research over five years on a breeding pair at the Cali Zoo in Colombia found that the average interval between litters was six to seven months, but as short as 77 days when the previous litter did not survive.<ref name=Cali/> Other sources have found greater intervals, with as long as 21 to 33 months suggested for the wild.<ref name=C18/> 

Mothers give birth to furred and blind cubs in an underground den near to the river shore and fishing sites.<ref>Duplaix, pg. 567.</ref> Males actively participate in rearing cubs and family cohesion is strong;<ref>Duplaix, pg. 576</ref> older, juvenile siblings also participate in rearing, although in the weeks immediately after birth they may temporarily leave the group.<ref name=C18/> Cubs open their eyes in their fourth week, begin walking in their fifth, and are able to swim confidently between 12 and 14 weeks.<ref name=Cali/> They are weaned by nine months and begin hunting successfully soon after.<ref name=C18/> The animal reaches sexual maturity at about two years of age and both male and female cubs leave the group permanently after two to three years.<ref name=Germany/><ref name=C18/> They then search for new territory to begin a family of their own.<ref name=Dortmund/>

The Giant Otter is very sensitive to human activity when rearing its young. No institution, for example, has successfully raised Giant Otter cubs unless parents were provided sufficient privacy measures; the stress caused by human visual and acoustic interference can lead to neglect, abuse and infanticide, as well as decreased lactation. In the wild, it has been suggested, although not systematically confirmed, that tourists cause similar stresses: disrupted lactation and denning, reduced hunting, and habitat abandonment are all risks.<ref name=Dortmund/> This sensitivity is matched by a strong protectiveness towards the young. All group members may aggressively charge intruders, including boats with humans in them.<ref>Duplaix, pp. 564–565, 570.</ref>

The longest documented Giant Otter lifespan in the wild is eight years. In captivity this may increase to 17, with an unconfirmed record of 19. The animal is susceptible to a variety of diseases, including the canine parvovirus. Parasites, such as the larvae of flies and a variety of intestinal worms, also afflict the Giant Otter.<ref name=Dortmund></ref> Other causes of death include accidents, gastroenteritis, infanticide, and epileptic seizures.<ref name=C18/>

=== Hunting and diet ===
right|thumb|250px|A captive Giant Otter, feeding. This predator grasps prey in its forepaws and begins eating immediately, at the head. 
The Giant  Otter is an order Perciformes, particularly cichlids, were seen in 97% of scats, and Characiformes, such as characins, in 86%. Fish remains were of medium-sized species that seem to prefer relatively shallow water, to the advantage of the probably visually oriented Giant Otter. Prey species found were also sedentary, generally swimming only short distances, which may aid the Giant Otter in predation. The Giant Otter seems to be opportunistic, taking whatever species are most locally abundant.<ref></ref> If fish are unavailable it will also take crabs, snakes, and even small caimans and anacondas.<ref name=OSF></ref> 

The species can hunt singly, in pairs, and in groups, relying on its sharp eyesight to locate prey.<ref name=D544>Duplaix, pg. 544–546</ref> In some cases, supposed cooperative hunting may be incidental, a result of group members fishing individually in close proximity; truly coordinated hunting may only occur where the prey cannot be taken by a single Giant Otter, such as with anacondas and the Black Caiman.<ref name=C15>Carter and Rosas, pg. 15.</ref> The Giant Otter seems to prefer prey fish that are generally immobile on river bottoms in clear water. Prey chase is rapid and tumultuous, with lunges and twists through the shallows and few missed targets. The otter can attack from both above and below, swiveling at the last instant to clamp the prey in its jaws. Giant Otters catch their own food and consume it immediately; they grasp the fish firmly between the forepaws and began eating noisily at the head.<ref name=D544/> Carter and Rosas have found that captive adult animals consume around 10% of their body weight daily—about , in keeping with findings in the wild.<ref name=C17>Carter and Rosas, pg. 17.</ref>
