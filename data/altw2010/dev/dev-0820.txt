Ephrata's population has steadily grown over the last century.  In 1900, 2,452 people lived there, in 1910, 3,192, and by 1940, the population had increased to 6,199. The population was 13,213 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Ephrata is noteworthy for having been the former seat of the Seventh-Day Dunkers. The community, which contained both men and women, was founded by Johann Conrad Beissel in 1732.

Many of the members were well-educated; Peter Miller, second prior of the monastery, translated the Declaration of Independence into seven languages, at the request of Congress. At the period of its greatest prosperity the community contained nearly 300 persons.<ref>Gibbons, ''Pennsylvania Dutch and Other Essays'', (Philadelphia, 1872)</ref> <ref>Sachse, ''The German Sectarians of Pennsylvania'', two volumes, (Philadelphia, 1899-1900) </ref>
