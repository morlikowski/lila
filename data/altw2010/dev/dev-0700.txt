Les '''Modes Alternatifs de Résolution des Conflits''' (MARC) sont des pratiques placées en regard des systèmes mis en place par les états et les gouvernements (recours contentieux, système judiciaire) impliquant un règlement à la fois juridique et judiciaire d'un différend. En anglais, il s'agit des ''ADR'', soit ''Alternative Dispute Resolution''. 

Ces modes ont fait l'objet d'un livre vert<ref>[http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/fr/lvb/l33189.htm Livre vert sur les modes alternatifs de résolution des conflits relevant du droit civil et commercial]</ref> au sein de la commission européenne qui souhaite promouvoir ces nouveaux modes de résolution des conflits.

== Généralités==

Selon les enjeux, on parle également de :
* MARL - le ''L'' signifiant ''Litiges''
* MARD - le ''D'' signifiant ''Différend''

Les modes alternatifs de résolution de conflit ou ''MARC'' se rapportent aux processus et aux techniques de ''résolution de conflit'' en dehors des procédures juridiques sous autorité étatique. 

La pratique la plus connue des MARC est aujourd'hui la médiation. Les intérêts que présentent ces modes sont les suivants :
* absence de lourdeur dans les procédures ou processus
* coûts contrôlés de la prestation choisie
* préférence pour la confidentialité
* avec la médiation, issue choisie par les parties

== Théorie ==

Un mode de résolution des conflits est considéré comme ''alternatif'' au regard du système de décision auquel il est fait référence de manière conventionnelle, c'est-à-dire du système juridique.

Tout processus tendant permettre à des parties en conflits de rechercher et de prendre leur propre décision visant à résoudre le conflit sera considéré comme alternatif, considérant qu'une décision judiciaire imposerait une décision. De même, dans une relation contentieuse avec une administration, la pratique de la négociation ou de l'intervention d'un tiers évitant le recours à une procédure sera considérée comme alternative.

==Discussion==

La discussion porte souvent sur l'usage du qualificatif ''alternatif''. A savoir, un mode alternatif devrait présenter deux possibilités. Or, dans cet usage ''alternatif'' tend à signifier ''une autre possibilité'' relativement à celle des rapports de force, sans offrir deux voies possibles.

==Listes des modes alternatifs de résolution des conflits==

===Arbitrage===

L'''arbitrage'' en matière contentieuse consiste à faire un appel à un tiers en dehors du système judiciaire. Ce tiers - qui peut être un collège de personnes missionnées par les parties - est chargé par les protagonistes d'instruire l'affaire, d'écouter les parties et de prendre une décision.

=== Conciliation ===

La ''conciliation'' consiste dans le recours à un tiers, généralement ce recours est prévu dans le cadre d'une procédure, écouter les parties et leur faire une proposition de réglement du différend.

=== Médiation===

La ''médiateur'', de trouver la solution la plus satisfaisante possible ''pour elle'' - non pour le tiers médiateur.

'''Alternative dispute resolution (ADR)''' includes dispute resolution processes and techniques that fall outside of the government judicial process.  Despite historic resistance to ADR by both parties and their advocates, ADR has gained widespread acceptance among both the general public and the legal profession in recent years.  In fact, some courts now require some parties to resort to ADR of some type, usually mediation, before permitting the parties' cases to be tried.  The rising popularity of ADR can be explained by the increasing caseload of traditional courts, the perception that ADR imposes fewer costs than litigation, a preference for confidentiality, and the desire of some parties to have greater control over the selection of the individual or individuals who will decide their dispute.

ADR is generally classified into at least four subtypes: negotiation, mediation, collaborative law, and arbitration. (Sometimes a fifth type, conciliation, is included as well, but for present purposes it can be regarded as a form of mediation. See conciliation for further details.) The salient features of each type are as follows:

*In negotiation, participation is voluntary and there is no third party who facilitates the resolution process or imposes a resolution. (NB --- a third party like a chaplain or organizational ombudsperson or social worker or a skilled friend may be coaching one or both of the parties behind the scene, a process called "Helping People Help Themselves" --see Helping People Help Themselves, in Negotiation Journal July 1990, p 239-248, which includes a section on helping someone draft a letter to someone who is perceived to have wronged them.)

*In mediation, there is a third party, a mediator, who facilitates the resolution process (and may even suggest a resolution, typically known as a "mediator's proposal"), but does ''not'' impose a resolution on the parties. In some countries (for example, the United Kingdom), ADR is synonymous with what is generally referred to as mediation in other countries.

*In collaborative law or collaborative divorce, each party has an attorney who facilitates the resolution process within specifically contracted terms. The parties reach agreement with support of the attorneys (who are trained in the process) and mutually-agreed experts. No one imposes a resolution on the parties. 

*In arbitration, participation is typically voluntary, and there is a third party who, as a private judge, imposes a resolution.  Arbitrations often occur because parties to contracts agree that any future dispute concerning the agreement will be resolved by arbitration. This is known as a 'Scott Avery Clause'.  In recent years, the enforceability of arbitration clauses, particularly in the context of consumer agreements (e.g., credit card agreements), has drawn scrutiny from courts.  Although parties may appeal arbitration outcomes to courts, such appeals face an exacting standard of review.

Beyond the basic types of alternative dispute resolutions there are other different forms of ADR:
- Case evaluation: a non-binding process in which parties present the facts and the issues to a neutral case evaluator who advises the parties on the strengths and weaknesses of their respective positions, and assesses how the dispute is likely to be decided by a jury or other adjudicator.
- Early neutral evaluation: a process that takes place soon after a case has been filed in court. The case is referred to an expert who is asked to provide a balanced and neutral evaluation of the dispute. The evaluation of the expert can assist the parties in assessing their case and may influence them towards a settlement.
- Family group conference: a meeting between members of a family and members of their extended related group. At this meeting the family becomes involved in making a plan to stop the abuse or other ill-treatment between its members.
-Neutral fact-finding: a process where a neutral third party, selected either by the disputing parties or by the court, investigates an issue and reports or testifies in court. The neutral fact-finding process is particularly useful for resolving complex scientific and factual disputes.
- Ombuds: third party selected by an institution – for example a university, hospital, corporation or government agency – to investigate complaints by employees, clients or constituents. The ombuds works within the institution to look into complaints independently and impartially.

"Alternative" dispute resolution is usually considered to be alternative to litigation.  It also can be used as a colloquialism for allowing a dispute to drop or as an alternative to violence.  

In recent years there has been more discussion about taking a systems approach in order to offer different kinds of  options to people who are in conflict,  and to foster APPROPRIATE dispute resolution. That is, some cases and some complaints in fact ought to go to formal grievance or to court or to the police or to a compliance officer or to a government IG. Other conflicts could be settled by the parties if they had enough support and coaching, and yet other cases need mediation or arbitration. Thus "alternative" dispute resolution simply means a method that is not the courts. "APPROPRIATE" dispute resolution considers all the possible responsible options for conflict resolution that are relevant for a given issue.

ADR - can increasingly be conducted online or by using technology. This branch of dispute resolution is known as online dispute resolution (ODR). It should be noted, however, that ODR services can be provided by government entities, and as such may form part of the litigation process. Moreover, they can be provided on a global scale, where no effective domestic remedies are available to disputing parties, as in the case of the UDRP and domain name disputes. In this respect, ODR might not satisfy the "alternative" element of ADR.
