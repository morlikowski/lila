}}'''Miroslav Klose''' (nado ''Mirosław Klose'' o 9 de Xuño, 1978 en Opole, Polonia) é un goleador da selección nacional de fútbol de Alemaña. A súa nai Barbara foi membro do equipo nacional polaco de balonmán (82 encontros internacionais)e o seu pai Josef, de etnia xermana, foi entre outras cousas un xogador de fútbol profesional no AJ Auxerre. A familia mudou primeiro á Francia e logo, no 1987, á Kusel en Alemaña. 
No Mundial de fútbol Corea e Xapón 2002, marcou cinco goles coa Selección nacional de fútbol de Alemaña, rematando coma un dos mellores xogadores do mundial. Esta marca a repetiría catro anos despois no Mundial de fútbol Alemaña 2006, resultando máximo anotador do torneo e quedando en terceiro posto coa selección xermana.

Na atualidade xoga no Bayern Munich, do que é unha das súas estrelas.

"Miro" e a súa muller Sylwia foron pais de xemelgos o 30 de Xaneiro de 2005, chamados Luan e Noah.

==Perfil do xogador==
A pesar da súa fama relativamente modesta, Klose é un dos mellores dianteiros que rematan coa testa na Bundesliga. Ademais, xoga dunha maneira naturalmente agresiva e é tecnicamente un xogador apropiado, capaz de rematar cos pés tamén. No 2005, o introvertido Klose é considerado coma un dos mellores goleadores alemáns.

==Outros datos==
A marca de fábrica de Miro, a celebración dos goles, consiste en abrazar ós seus compañeiros de equipo Johan Micoud e Ivan Klasnic ou un "Salto" (termo alemán para voltereta) que fixo ata cinco veces durante a Copa do Mundo de 2002.

===As footballer===
Klose learned his football at a village club, Blaubach-Diedelkopf, in the German seventh division. Klose had also successfully completed an apprenticeship to become a carpenter and had worked in this profession until joining the professional team of 1. FC Kaiserslautern.

Klose made it professional much later than football players in the age bracket. He has in the past had many comparisons with various world class strikers such as Owen and Van Nistelrooy. When asked about the comparisons Klose expressed his flattery to be compared to the likes of Van Nistelrooy, “It's an honour to be compared to Ruud. He's played in Europe for so long and has a great goal scoring record. I hope one day I can be as good as him.” This interview was conducted in June 2007 with Der Spiegel prior his move to Bayern Munich.

==Club career==
===Kaiserslautern===
After a season at FC Homburg, he eventually joined the amateur division of FC Kaiserslautern. 

A year after joining the club he made it into the first team. In his first 67 matches, Klose scored 33 goals. The 2002–03 season was a comparatively disappointing one as Klose found the back of the net a mere seven times.

===Werder Bremen===

Klose transferred to Werder Bremen in €5 million. After a lackluster start, Klose formed an impressive attacking triangle with French midfielder Croatian forward Paraguayan forward Nelson Valdez, scoring 15 goals in the Bundesliga.

Despite his relatively slender frame, Klose is one of the best headers of the ball in the Bundesliga. Moreover, he combines a natural killer instinct inside the box with excellent technical ability, and is equally lethal with the ball at his feet. By 2005-06 season, he scored 25 goals, the highest that season, and registered 16 assists in just 26 games in the Bundesliga. 

After his strong performance at the 2006 World Cup, Klose was linked by newspapers with a move away from the Barcelona and Juventus were listed among his potential suitors. Klose was also heavily linked with a move to Bayern Munich, with Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer an admirer of Klose.

Klose came on as a substitute and headed in from close range the winning 2-1 goal two minutes from time. <ref></ref>

In an interview given to Przeglad Sportowy on June 9, 2008, Klose stated that the decision to play for Germany instead of Poland was not an easy one, and if Polish officials had been faster, he would be playing for Poland now. Furthermore, he added that he does not regret the choice, as with Germany he has won medals in the World Cup tournaments.<ref name="euro2008.pl"/> The German national team has never lost a game in which Klose has scored.
