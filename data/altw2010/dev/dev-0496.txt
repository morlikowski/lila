'''Täplädelfiini''' (''Stenella attenuata'') on noin kahden metrin pituinen hammasvalaslaji. Laji on saanut nimensä ihoa kirjovista tummemmista täplistä, joita tosin poikasilla ei vielä ole. Täplädelfiinit elävät Atlantin melko lämpimissä vesissä ja ovat muiden delfiinien tavoin hyvin leikkisiä ja älykkäitä. Ne liikkuvat usein melko pienissä, alle 20 yksilön parvissa.

The '''Pantropical Spotted Dolphin''' (''Stenella attenuata'') is a purse seines. The 1980s saw the rise of "dolphin-friendly" tuna capture methods in order to save millions of the species in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first identified by John Gray in 1846. Gray's initial analysis included the Atlantic Spotted Dolphin in this species. They are now regarded as separate. Both the genus and specific names come from Latin words meaning thin or thinning.

There are three subspecies recognised in Rice's 1998 survey of cetacea taxonomy. Two of these have not been formally named
:''S. a. subspecies A'', the off-shore form found in the eastern Pacific 
:''S. a. subspecies B'', a form found around the Hawaiian islands.
:''S. a. graffmani'', coastal form found from Mexico to Peru

==Physical description==

The Pantropical Spotted Dolphin varies significantly in size and colaration throughout its range. The most significant division is between coastal and pelagic varieties. The coastal form is larger and more spotted. (These two forms have been divided into subspecies only in eastern Pacific populations &mdash; see taxonomy above).

Spots are key defining characteristics in adults, though immature individuals are generally uniformly coloured and susceptible to confusion with the Bottlenose Dolphin. Populations around the Gulf of Mexico may be relatively spot-free even in adulthood. In the Atlantic, confusion is possible with the Atlantic Spotted Dolphin.

Broadly speaking the Dolphin has a long thin beak. The upper and lower jaws are darkly coloured but are separated by thin white "lips". The chin, throat and belly are white to pale grey with a limited amount of spots. The flanks are separated into three distinct bands of colour &mdash; the lightest at the bottom, followed by a thin grey strip in the middle of the flank and a dark grey back. The tall concave dorsal fin is similarly coloured. The thick tail stock matches the colour of the middle band.

The Pantropical Spotted Dolphin is very active and is prone to making large splashy leaps from the sea. It is a common breacher and will often clear the water for a second or more. Bow-riding and other play with boats is common.

In the eastern Pacific, the Dolphin is often found swimming with Yellowfin Tuna (hence the problem with dolphin deaths caused by tuna fishing &mdash; see the Human interaction section). However they do not feed on that fish. In fact the two species have a similar diet of small epipelagic fish. In other areas the species may also feed on squid and crustaceans.
