'''Orlandus Wilson''' (* Chesapeake, US-amerikanischer Gospelsänger und Arrangeur. Er sang die Bassstimme im Golden Gate Quartet.  

Aus einer ländlichen Familie stammend, trat er 1935 dem ein Jahr zuvor in Norfolk (Virginia) gegründeten ''Golden Gate Jubilee Singers'' bei, wo er Robert Ford ersetzte. Wilson gehörte der  1941 in ''Golden Gate Quartett'' umbenannten Gruppe von 1935 bis 1994 an, betreute sie danach bis zu seinem Tod 1998 bei Proben. Schon wegen dieser extrem langen Bandzugehörigkeit hat er das Golden Gate Quartett geprägt wie kein anderes Mitglied. 

Rhythmus und Harmonik kamen bei Wilson in selten erreichter Weise in Einklang. Ein Kritiker nannte das eine geist-erfüllte Musik für Körper und Seele. Ein anderer attestierte einen Sinn für Timing und Synkopierung als Grundlage für "jump, glide, bounce and swing". 

Außer als Bassist wirkte Wilson auch als Manager der Gruppe und zeichnete für die vierstimmigen Gesangsarrangements verantwortlich, die zum Vorbild für viele anderen Quartette und Quintette sowohl des Black wie des Chöre adaptiert und ist bis heute beliebt als eine swingende Gospelnummer, die die frohe Botschaft auch als eine fröhliche herüberbringt.

'''The Golden Gate Quartet''' (aka The jubilee quartet style.  Founded as the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet in Henry Owens and Orlandus Wilson. They began as a traditional jubilee quartet, combining the clever arrangements associated with barbershop quartets with rhythms borrowed from the blues and jazz like scat singing.

The makeup of the group changed over the years, as some members were drafted during the war and new members were brought in to replace those who had retired or left to join other groups. William Langford joined the group when Griffin left in 1935 and Orlandus Wilson replaced Ford the same year. Clyde Riddick replaced Langford in 1938, Johnson left in 1948 to join "The Jubalaires" and Owens left the group later to become a preacher and solo artist. Riddick remained with the group until his retirement in 1995 and Wilson until his death in 1998.

The Gates had a broad repertoire of styles--from Owens' mournful, understated approach in songs such as ''Anyhow'' or ''Hush, Somebody's Calling My Name'', to the group's highly syncopated arrangements in ''Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego''. Like The Mills Brothers of popular music, they would often include vocal special effects in their songs, imitating train sounds in songs such as ''Golden Gate Gospel Train''. Langford often sang lead, using his ability to range from baritone to falsetto, while Johnson narrated in a hip syncopated style that became the hallmark for the group. Wilson's bass served as the anchor for the group and Owens harmonized with Langford and Johnson.

They achieved regional fame through their John Hammond presented them as part of the 1938 extravaganza ''From Spirituals to Swing'' in World War Two, making several appearances in popular front songs such as  ''Stalin Wasn't Stalling'' that mixed humor with political commentary.

The quartet lost their preeminent position in gospel music after the war, when they faced competition from the newer hard gospel quartets. They continued in their old style, offering sharper political commentary in songs such as ''God's Gonna Cut 'Em Down'', but losing much of their audience to quartets such as the Dixie Hummingbirds and the Soul Stirrers. Johnson left for the Jubilaires in 1948, and Owens departed in 1950 to become a preacher. 

The Golden Gates revived their career in 1955, however, when they toured Paris in 1959 and has continued touring, primarily in Europe, since then. During his stint in the US Army, in Germany,  Elvis Presley, who was a huge  admirer of their work since his early childhood, visited them backstage at "Le Lido",  in Paris,  and stayed to watch their entire show, staying also with them at the hotel "Prince de Galles". 

The Quartet appeared in films such as ''Star Spangled Rhythm'' (1942), ''Hit Parade of 1943'' (1943), ''Hollywood Canteen'' (1944), and the Danny Kaye film ''A Song Is Born'' (1948). In the latter film, they performed the songs "Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho" and part of "A Song Is Born" with Louis Armstrong and Virginia Mayo.
