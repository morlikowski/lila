'''Orlovtravare''', är en hästras, som finns i två typer; den tunga och den lätta. Det är den tunga som finns nu mest i Ryssland, där orlovtravare kommer ifrån. Den lätta typen används fortfarande inom trav i Ryssland. De tyngre hästarna drar traditionella vagnar i Ryssland kallade trojka där tre hästar går på bredd. Den mittersta hästen travar, medan de två hästarna på sidorna galopperar för att hålla takten.

==Historia==

Före den arabisk hingst vid namn Smetanka från en turkisk sultan. I sitt stuteri utanför Moskva hade han några av världens finaste hästar som han hade köpt från Danmark, Holland, Tyskland och Mellanöstern. Han började genast avla på Smetanka men 1788 flyttade han verksamheten till ett annat stuteri i Voronesj där han arbetade tillsammans med en mycket skicklig stuterichef, V.I. Sjisjkin. Tillsammans kom de fram till att de bästa avkommorna var med de danska och holländska stona, då speciellt en hingst som kom att bli stamfader för hela Orlovtravaren. Bars I var en gråskimmel som föddes 1784. Han var sonson till Smetanka  och hade både holländskt och danskt påbrå. 

Bars I fick betäcka ston av de raser som ingick i honom själv, arabiska fullblod, holländska och danska hästar. För att fixera en typ linjeavlade man på Bars I och hans söner. Alla renrasiga Orlovtravare ska därför ha en stamtavla som kan spåras till Bars I. 

1834 började man med prestationsprov och systematisk träning inom amerikanska travaren. Orlovrtravaren var mycket långsammare och kunde inte nå upp till den amerikanska travarens klass. Därför ingick Orlovtravaren istället i utvecklingen av den ryska travaren genom att man korsade Orlovtravare med amerikanska travare. 

Idag används Orlovtravaren fortfarande som körhäst men i Ryssland används de till största del för att förädla andra hästar. Uppfödarna jobbar även på att utveckla tävlingshästar av Orlovtravaren, genom att behålla höjden, de eleganta linjerna och den lätta men starka benbyggnaden samtidigt som de avlar  bort svagheterna och höjer prestationsförmågan. Det finns även två olika typer av Orlovtravaren även om utseendet kan variera mycket mer än så beroende på vilket stuteri Orlovtravaren har fötts upp på.

The '''Orlov Trotter''' (also known as ''Orlov;'' Russian: орловский рысак) is a breed with a hereditary fast Count Alexei Orlov at his Khrenovskoy mares (primarily of English, Dutch, Danish breeding) with Arabian stallions. 

During the 19th century, Orlov trotters were used mainly for riding and American-developed mares and a new breed, the  Soviet disregard of horse-raising. However, the breed survived, and today fifteen stud farms in Russia and the Ukraine raise pure-blooded Orlov Trotters.

==Development of the breed==
thumb|left|Smetanka
The land that became Orlov's Khrenovsky stud farm was given to him by Catherine II (Catherine the Great) as a reward for his participation in the coup d'etat which brought her to the throne. The buildings were constructed by Giovanni Giliardi. The original estate was very large; the modern Khrenovsky stud area is fifteen times smaller than it was prior to the Bolshevik revolution.

The ancestor of all Orlov Trotters was the purebred grey Arabian stallion roubles.<ref>[http://www.horses.ru/arabian/hist_main.htm "History of the Russian Arabian." Web site accessed March 29, 2007]</ref>  Although he died the next year, he lived to sire five offspring. Among others he was crossed with Isabelline, a Danish mare from the Frederiksborg royal stud-farm, who foaled a stallion that was named Polkan (1778–1793). 

Polkan was crossed with a Dutch mare which, in 1784, produced the grey stallion Bars I (1784–1808), considered the first Orlov trotter. He was 162,5 cm high at the gait and featured the beauty and noble bearing which would later distinguish the newly=created breed. For seventeen years Bars I was crossed with different mares and sired eleven stallions that carried his distinguishing characteristics.  The emergence of the breed was the result of a thorough and elaborate selection process. About 3,000 horses kept at the stud were involved.<ref>[http://www.imh.org/imh/bw/orlov.html "Orlov Trotter"]</ref>. Unlike many other Russian nobles who were fond of horse-raising, Orlov was a professional breeder who is also credited for creating some seventy different animal breeds including the Russian wolfhound.

Orlov was very protective of his bloodstock, and would sell only castrated stallions). Even when Alexander I asked Orlov to sell him several stallions, Orlov only agreed to sell geldings. This rule was maintained for twenty years after Orlov's death. Later, when the Khrenovsky stud farm belonged to the Russian Crown, Trotters were then openly sold to private stud-owners.

==Orlov trotters in the 19th century==

In 1809, the Khrenovsky stud-farm was inherited by Orlov's daughter Anna. Until 1831 Orlov's disciple, the former serf Vasily Shishkin, continued to develop the breed. However, in 1831, he left the Khrenovsky stud-farm and founded his own. Orlov's daughter lacked her father's competence in horse-breeding and the Khrenovsky stud-farm went downhill. Trotters were intensively crossed with various European breeds in order to increase their dimensions and their quality fell.  In 1845, the stud-farm passed into the hands of the Crown, but for some time this only made matters worse. It was able to regain its fame only some decades later. In 1881, the Khrenovsky stud-farm stopped raising all breeds except for Orlov trotters.  The best Orlov trotters were now raised in private stud-farms such as the Shishkin's. 

In 1834, a Trotting Society was established in Moscow, and regular races began.  Orlov trotters had already proved to be the best racing horses in Russia and soon they proved to be the best in Europe. In 1867, Orlov trotter Beduin made headlines when, at World's Fair in Paris, it covered 3500 feet in 1 minute 32 seconds – 4 seconds ahead the fastest Standardbred mare, Flora Temple. Since then many trotters have been sold abroad where they greatly contributed to the creation of local trotting breeds. Meanwhile, in the USA, Standardbreds were gradually improved until they were able to outrace Orlov trotters. In 1877, harness racing totalisator emerged in Russia and this led to crucial changes in breeding Orlovs. Many stud-farmers turned to raising racing horses who were not as large and hard-working or as beautiful and elegant as traditional Orlov trotters. Since Standardbreds were, in general, faster than Orlov trotters, these breeds were intensively crossed. The resulting breed was called Russian trotters and they lacked many distinctive features of Orlov trotters. They were smaller and lighter and were not capable of doing as much work as Orlov trotters. In order to prevent Orlov trotters from disappearing through mixing with Standardbreds, the government introduced separate races for Orlov trotters and Standardbreds. Finally Russian stud-farmers managed to improve the racing performance of Orlov trotters. Stallion Krepysh born in 1904 won 55 races and covered 1 mile for 2 minutes 8.5 seconds.  He was the fastest trotter in pre-revolutionary Russia.  Krepysh and most of his issue died during the Russian civil war.

==In the Soviet Union==

The Civil war was a major disaster for horse breeding in Russia.  Many horses died in battle, yet more were eaten for food, and there was a general collapse of the economy, making horse breeding a luxury few could afford. However, after 1920, the raising of Orlov Trotters resumed and crossbreeding was forbidden. At that time, Orlov trotters were used primarily for farming and transport due to their physical strength and outstanding working abilities. By the 1930s, race breeding had also been reestablished and pre-revolutionary racing records were being broken. Arguably, the Orlovs reached their second heyday in the 1930s.
