'''Malamir''' () was the ruler of Bulgaria 831&ndash;836.

Malamir was a son of Omurtag and a grandson of Krum.  Clearly, his name is of Slavic origin<ref>Insert footnote text here</ref>, being the first Bulgar khan to possess a Slavic name. This has led to the speculation that his mother was a Slav, which cannot be proven.   

Malamir became ruler of Bulgaria in 831 on the death of his father Omurtag, because his older brother Enravota (Voin) had forfeited his right to the succession by becoming a Christian.  It is possible that Malamir was young and inexperienced at the time of his accession, and that affairs of state were managed by his minister (''kaukhanos'') Isbul.   

About 833 Malamir executed his older brother Enravota for refusing to renounce Theophilos ravaged the regions inside the Bulgarian frontier.  The Bulgarians retaliated, and under the leadership of Isbul they reached Adrianople.  At this time, if not earlier, the Bulgarians annexed Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and its environs.  Several surviving monumental inscriptions from this reign make reference to the Bulgarian victories and others to the continuation of construction activities in and near Pliska.  Malamir died in 836, allegedly as retribution for his execution of his older brother.

In several older studies Malamir is identified with his successor Presian I, and it is assumed that he survived until the 850s as the direct predecessor of Boris I. This is very unlikely, as Malamir is attested as having been succeeded by his nephew (the son of his brother Zvinica), while Boris I was preceded by his father Presian I.  Zlatarski resolved the problems in the fragmentary sources by determining that Malamir's unnamed nephew and successor was in fact Presian I, and Boris I was the latter's son.

The 17th century Volga Bulgar compilation ''Ja'far Tarikh'' (a work of disputed authenticity) represents Balamir (i.e., Malamir) as the son of Yomyrčak (i.e., Omurtag), and as the brother of Sabanša (i.e., Zvinica), who was the father of Birdžihan (i.e., Presian I).

'''Malamir''' ( '''Маламир''') (-836) fut khan des Bulgares de 831 à 836.  

Malamir était le fils de slave, spéculant sur le fait que sa mère serait slave. Malamir devint prince de chrétien. D'ailleurs vers 833, Malamir fit exécuter ce dernier, au motif qu'il refusait d'abjurer sa foi chrétienne.

Il est possible que Malamir étant jeune et inexpérimenté lors de son accession au pouvoir, les affaires de l'état furent gérées dans un premier temps par son ministre (''kaukhanos'') Théophile ravagea les régions à l'intérieur de la frontière bulgare. Les Bulgares en représailles, sous la conduite Adrinople. Ils annexèrent aussi Philippopolis (Plovdiv) et ses environs. Plusieurs inscriptions monumentales dans la région de Pliska, font état de ces victoires bulgares, pour les unes, et des activités de construction sous le règne de Malamir, pour les autres. Malamir mourut en 836, prétendument comme rétribution pour l'exécution de son frère aîné.
