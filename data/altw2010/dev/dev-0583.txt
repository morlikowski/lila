'''Queens''' is the largest in area and the second most populous of the five boroughs of county of New York State. 

Located on the western portion of John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia), the U.S. Open), Kaufman Astoria Studios, Silvercup Studios, Flushing Meadows Corona Park, and Queens Center (the most profitable per-square-foot mall in America).

As of the 2005 American Community Survey, immigrants comprise 47.6% of Queens residents making Queens the city's most diverse borough.<ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?_event=&geo_id=05000US36081&_geoContext=01000US%7C04000US36%7C05000US36081&_street=&_county=queens&_cityTown=queens&_state=&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=050&_submenuId=factsheet_1&ds_name=null&_ci_nbr=null&qr_name=null&reg=null%3Anull&_keyword=&_industry= 2005 American Community Survey Fact Sheet for Queens County, New York], tenth most populous county in the United States. The 2.2 million figure is the highest historical population for the borough.  [http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html]  Were each borough an independent city, Queens would be the fifth largest city in the United States (and Brooklyn would be fourth).

Queens was established in 1683 as one of the original 12 counties of New York and was supposedly named for the then-Charles II[http://queens.about.com/od/queensalmanac/f/queens_name.htm] [http://www.ny.com/histfacts/geography.html#queens] (this is not supported by contemporary documents).
The borough is often considered one of the more Nassau County. In its northwestern section, however, Queens is home to many urban neighborhoods and several central business districts. Long Island City, on the Queens' waterfront across from Manhattan, is the site of the Citicorp Building, the tallest skyscraper in New York City outside of Manhattan.

==History==
European colonization brought both Dutch and English settlers, as a part of the Maspeth in 1642,<ref></ref> and Flushing) in 1643.<ref name="ellis-p54"></ref>  Other early settlements included Newtown (now Elmhurst) and Jamaica.  However, these towns were mostly inhabited by English settlers from Suffolk County) subject to Dutch law.  After the capture of the colony by the English and its renaming as New York in 1664, the area (and all of Long Island) became known as Yorkshire.

Originally, Queens County included the adjacent area now comprising Nassau County. It was an original county of New York State, one of twelve created in 1683.

Queens played a minor role in the American Revolution, as compared to Brooklyn where the Battle of Long Island was largely fought. Queens, like the rest of Long Island, fell under British occupation after the Battle of Long Island in 1776 and remained occupied throughout most of the rest of the war. Under the Quartering Act, British soldiers used, as barracks, the public inns and uninhabited buildings belonging to Queens residents, against the will of many of the local people. The quartering of soldiers in private homes, except in times of war, was banned by the Third Amendment to the United States Constitution. Nathan Hale was captured by the British on the shore of Flushing Bay in Queens before being executed in Manhattan.

From 1683 until 1784, Queens County consisted of five towns: Flushing, Hempstead, Jamaica, Newtown, and Oyster Bay.  On Town of North Hempstead, was formed through secession by the northern portions of the Town of Hempstead.<ref>

|quote=From the final withdrawal of the British in November, 1783, until the 1830s, Queens continued as an essentially Long Island area of farms and villages. The location of the county government in Mineola (in present-day Nassau County) underscores the island orientation of that era. Population grew hardly at all, increasing only from 5,791 in 1800 to 7,806 in 1830, suggesting that many younger sons moved away, seeking fortunes where land was not yet so fully taken up for farming.

|quote=There was only one post office established in present Nassau County when the Long Island post road to Sag Harbor was established September 25, 1794. It appears that the mail from New York went to Jamaica. This was the only post office in the present day Boroughs of Queens or Brooklyn before 1803.  From Jamaica the mail went east along the Jericho Turnpike/Middle Country Road route and ended at Sag Harbor. The only post office on this route between Jamaica and Suffolk County was QUEENS established the same date as the others on this route 9/25/1794. This post office was officially Queens, but I have seen the area called "Queens Court House" and was located approximately in the Mineola-Westbury area. The courthouse was used until the 1870's when the county court was moved to Long Island City. Later it served as the Queens County Insane Asylum and still later as an early courthouse for the new Nassau County, during construction of the present "old" Nassau County Courthouse in Mineola. It was demolished shortly after 1900 ... after about 120 years of service of one type or the other.

From 1905 to 1908 the LIRR in Queens was electrified. Transportation to and from Manhattan, previously by ferry or via bridges in Brooklyn, opened up when the Queensboro Bridge was finished in 1909, and with railway tunnels under the East River in 1910. From 1915 onward, much of Queens was connected to the New York City subway system.<ref>

With the construction of the Steinway Tunnel carrying the IRT Flushing Line between Queens and Manhattan, and the emergent expansion of the use of the automobile, the 
population of Queens more than doubled in the 1920s, from 469,042 in 1920 to 1,079,129 in 1930.<ref></ref>. This was followed by the IND Queens Boulevard Line via the 53rd Street Tunnel which included a special loop station for the 1939 World's Fair.

==Geography==
Queens County is in the western part of Long Island and includes a few smaller islands, most of which are in Jamaica Bay and form part of Gateway National Recreation Area, which is in turn one of the National Parks of New York Harbor [http://www.nps.gov/npnh/index.htm ]The Rockaway Peninsula sits between Jamaica Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The western and northern edge of the borough is defined a watery continuum made up of Newtown Creek which flows
into the tidal estuary known as the East River, which includes the associated Flushing Bay and Flushing River. The East River into opens into {[Long Island Sound]]. The mid-section of Queens is crossed by the Long Island straddling terminal moraine created by the Wisconsin Glacier. This feature evolved into a land use pun due to the siting of many cemeteries.

The tallest tree in the New York metropolitan area, called the Queens Giant, is also the oldest living thing in the New York metro area. It is located in northeastern Queens, and is 450 years old and  tall as of 2005.<!--what kind of tree is it? even linked article does not say-->

According to the sq&nbsp;mi); 109.2 sq&nbsp;mi of it is land and 38.73% of it is water.

The Far Rockaway, and Floral Park. These ZIP codes do not necessarily reflect actual neighborhood names and boundaries; "East Elmhurst," for example, was largely coined by the USPS and is not an official community. Most neighborhoods have no solid boundaries. The Forest Hills and Rego Park neighborhoods, for instance, overlap.

Residents of Queens often closely identify with their neighborhood rather than with the borough or city as a whole. Postal addresses are written with the neighborhood, state, and then zip code rather than the borough or city. The borough is a patchwork of dozens of unique neighborhoods, each with its own distinct identity:
* Howard Beach, Ozone Park, Middle Village, and Whitestone, are home to large Italian American populations.
* Rockaway Beach and Woodside have large Irish American populations. 
* Astoria, in the northwest, is traditionally home to one of the largest Greek populations outside of Greece, and is home to a growing population of young professionals from Manhattan.  Nearby Long Island City is a major commercial center and the home of the Queensbridge housing project.
* Maspeth and Ridgewood are home to many European immigrants, including large Romanian, Polish, and other Slavic populations. Ridgewood also has a large Hispanic population.
* Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and Corona make up an enormous conglomeration of Hispanic,  Asian American and South Asian communities.
* Flushing, one of the largest neighborhoods in Queens, is home to people of European, Asian, Hispanic and African-American descent.  There are large Korean and Chinese communities as well.
* Richmond Hill, in the south, is often thought of as "Little Guyana" for its large Sikhs from the Indian state of Punjab.
* Rego Park, Forest Hills, and Kew Gardens have traditionally large Jewish populations (many of these communities are Jewish immigrants from Israel, Iran and the former Soviet Union). Also known for large and growing Hispanic/Latino community, mainly immigrants from South America. 
* Jamaica Estates, Fresh Meadows, and Hollis Hills are also populated with many people of Jewish background. Many Asian families reside in parts of Fresh Meadows as well.
* Jamaica is home to large Hollis, Saint Albans, Cambria Heights, Springfield Gardens, Rosedale, and Laurelton along east and southeast Queens.
* Bellerose and Floral Park are home to a large Punjab and the south-Indian state of South Jamaica.

Together, these neighborhoods comprise the most diverse county in the United States.<ref>Roberts, Sam. [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/18/us/18population.html "A 300 Millionth American. Don’t Ask Who."], ''The New York Times'', October 18, 2006. "In Queens, the nation’s most diverse county, Emanuel Plata weighed in at 6 pounds 15 ounces at Elmhurst Hospital Center..."</ref> Several of these neighborhoods are home to a diverse mix of many different ethnicities.

Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, Queens has been governed by the New York City Charter that provides for a strong mayor-council system. The centralized New York City government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services in Queens.

The office of Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court's 1964 "one man, one vote" decision.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0489_0688_ZS.html Cornell Law School Supreme Court Collection: Board of Estimate of City of New York v. Morris], accessed June 12, 2006.</ref>

Since 1990 the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations. Queens' Borough President is Democrat in 2001 and re-elected in 2005.

The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices.  Sixty-three percent of registered Queens voters are Democrats. Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education and economic development. Controversial political issues in Queens include development, noise, and the cost of housing.

'''Queens''' est l'une des cinq circonscriptions (borough) de la ville de New York aux États-Unis, avec Manhattan, Brooklyn, le Bronx et Staten Island. Il coïncide avec le '''comté de Queens''', découpage administratif de l’État de New York. En 2000, sa population était de 2&nbsp;229&nbsp;379 habitants. Créé le 1 novembre 1683, il a été baptisé en l'honneur de la reine consort (''queen consort'') Catherine de Bragance, épouse du roi Charles II d'Angleterre.

== Géographie ==

Le district de Queens occupe une partie de l'île de Long Island, ainsi que son voisin Brooklyn. Il comprend également d'autres petites îles, la plupart étant situées dans Jamaica Bay. La surface totale du comté est de 461 km², dont 282,9 km² de terres émergées et 178,8 km² d'eau. Il est en superficie le plus étendu des ''boroughs'' de New York. Queens est relié à Manhattan par le pont de Queensboro. Le seul accès routier à Roosevelt Island est à partir du Queens, par un pont plus petit au bout de la 36 avenue.

== Démographie ==

Le Queens est l'un des quartiers les plus multi-ethniques de l'agglomération new-yorkaise. Des immigrés venant de tous les continents s'installent ici depuis longtemps à cause de la proximité de Manhattan, relié au Queens par le métro et des loyers raisonnables. 130 nationalités, 500 000 nouveaux arrivants au cours des dix dernières années, près de 48 % d'étrangers, telles sont les données démographiques du district.

La population est composée de 44% d'habitants « blancs » d'origine européenne, de 20% d'afro-américains, 17,5% d'asiatiques, le reste ayant d'autres origines. 23% de la population du Queens a moins de 18 ans.

Dans la zone de Flushing se trouve une forte concentration de population d'origine chinoise et coréenne (voir Chinatown).

== Histoire ==

Au départ, le comté de Queens incluait une zone voisine qui englobe maintenant le comté de Nassau. C'est un des 12 comtés créés en même temps que l'État de New York en 1683. Avant 1870, le comté de Queens possédait six communes : Newtown, Flushing, Jamaica, North Hempstead, Hempstead, et Oyster Bay. En 1870 la ville de Long Island ( ''Long Island City'' ) y fut incorporée. Long Island City, Newtown, Flushing, Jamaica, et la partie Rockaway Peninsula de Hempstead devinrent le ''borough'' de Queens de New York le 1 Janvier 1898. La partie de Queens County qui ne fut pas annexée à la ville de New York (North Hempstead, Oyster Bay et la ville de Hempstead à l'exception de Rockaway Peninsula) constitua le comté de Nassau en 1899.

== Économie ==

thumb|right|250px|L'[[Unisphere, dans le Flushing Meadow-Corona Park]]

L'économie de Queens repose sur le tourisme, l'industrie et le commerce. Queens abrite deux aéroports majeurs de New York, l'aéroport international John-F.-Kennedy dans le quartier de Jamaica et l'Aéroport international de La Guardia à Flushing.
