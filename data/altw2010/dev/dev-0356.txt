==History==
===Foundations===
The company was begun as '''Fratelli Prada''' ( ''English:'' '''''Prada Brothers''''' ) by Mario Prada in 1913 as a leathergoods shop in English steamer trunks and handbags.<ref name="funding"/> Fratelli Prada gained great reputation and came to create accounts with prominent Italian noblemen.<ref name="funding"/> Mario Prada did not believe in women interaction within business, and so he prevented female family members from entering into his workshop.<ref name="funding"/> After his death in the mid-1950s, Mario's son harbored no interest in the business. So ironically, it was Mario's daughter-in-law who took the helm of Prada, and maintained it for almost twenty years.<ref name="funding"/> Her own daughter, Miuccia Prada, joined the company in 1970. Miuccia began making waterproof backbacks out of ''Pocone''.<ref name="lifeinitaly"/><ref name="fragrance"/> She met Patrizio Bertelli in 1977, an Italian who had begun his own leathergoods business at the age of 17, and he joined the company soon on.<ref name="funding"/> He greatly advised Miuccia -- and she readily followed the advice -- on better decisions for the Prada company. It was his advice to discontinue importing English goods and to begin to revolutionize the old-fashioned luggage styles.<ref name="funding"/>

===Prada's ascent into high-fashion===
Miuccia inherited the company in 1978 by which time sales were up to $400,000 USD.<ref name="funding"/> With Bertelli alongside her as business manager, Miuccia was allowed time to implement for total mind onto design.<ref name="lifeinitaly"/> She would go on to incorporate her ideas into the House of Prada that would transform it into a label of renown.<ref name="lifeinitaly"/> She released her first set of backbacks and totes in 1979. They were made out of a tough military spec black nylon that her grandfather had used as coverings for his steamer trunks.<ref name="funding"/> Initial success was not instant, as they were hard to sell due to the lack of advertising and high-prices, but the lines would go on to become her first commercial hit.<ref name="funding"/> Next, Miuccia and Bertelli sought out wholesale accounts for the bags in upscale department stores and boutiques worldwide.<ref name="funding"/> In 1983, Prada opened a second boutique in Millan reminiscent to the original shop, but with a sleek and modern contrast to it. It was opened in the historic and upscale shopping district of Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II.<ref name="funding"/>

The next year, Prada released its nylon tote.<ref name="funding"/> That same year, the House of Prada began expansion across continental Florence, Time'' described the apparel as "unassertive, combining traditional good manners and an ultramodern industrial sleekness."<ref name="funding"/> Truly, the designs to come out of the House of Prada reflected feminine worker aesthetic which made it quite unique in contrast to other high-fashion brands.<ref name="funding"/> It would be identified with as for the affluent working women who held demanding jobs identified with it."<ref name="funding"/> Thus, it is no surprise that Miuccia herself took it upon herself to call her women's outfits as "uniforms."<ref name="funding"/>

The logo for the label, the Prada silver-and black triangle, was not the main design element unlike other prominent luxury brands the likes of Louis Vuitton.<ref name="funding"/> And its appeal, including the apparel, were taken as "anti-status" or "reverse snobbery."<ref name="funding"/>

===Establishing image in the 1990s===

Prada's originality gained it a place as the most influential fashion house in terms of design and look in the 1990s<ref name="lifeinitaly"/> and was well becoming the 1990s premium status symbol.<ref name="funding"/> The signature Prada look encompassed luxurious fabrics in colors of mostly black, browns, grays, greens, and creams incorporated to become simple yet provocative styles. ''Life in Italy'' states that clothing was "sexy and spoke of confidence without revealing too much skin. Accessories included skinny leather belts, elegant high heeled shoes, and of course, the classic handbag."<ref name="lifeinitaly"/> 

For 1990, sales were reported at L 70 billion, or $31.7 million USD.<ref name="funding"/> Partrizio di Marco became in charge of growing business in the United States after working for the House in Asia. He was successful in having the Prada bags prominently displayed in department stores, and, so, they became a hit with fashion editors. Prada's continued success was attributed to its "working-class" theme that Ginia Bellafante in the New York Times Magazine proclaimed, "was becoming chic in the high-tech, IPO-driven early 1990s."<ref name="funding"/> Furthermore, now husband and wife, Miuccia and Bertelli led the Prada lable on a very cautious expansion, making products hard to come by.<ref name="funding"/> In 1992, the clothing brand Miu Miu was launched. It was named after Miuccia's nickname, and catered for more younger consumer base by offering apparel constructed out of "tacky synthetic fabrics".<ref name="funding"/> By 1993 Prada was awarded the Council of Fashion Designers of America award for accessories.<ref name="lifeinitaly"/><ref name="fragrance"/>

Men's ready-to-wear collections were launched in the middle of the decade as well.<ref name="funding"/> By 1994, sales were at  $210 million USD, with clothing sales making up for 20% (expected to double in 1995).<ref name="funding"/> Prada won another award from the CFDA, this time in 1995 as "Designer of the Year."<ref></ref><ref name="fragrance"></ref> 1996 witnessed the opening of the 18,000ft<sup>2</sup> Prada boutique in Manhattan, New York, the largest in the chain at the time.<ref name="funding"/> By now the House of Prada operated 40 locations worldwide, 20 of which were prominently located in Japan.<ref name="funding"/> As for manufacturing, the company owned eight factories and subcontracted work from 84 other manufacturers in Italy. Miuccia's Prada and Bertelli company were merged together to create Prapar B.V. in 1996.<ref name="funding"/> The name, however, was later changed to Prada B.V. and Patrizio Bertelli was named Chief Executive Officer of the Prada luxury company.

In 1997, revenue was recorded at  $674 million USD.<ref name="funding"/> Another location in Milan was opened that same year. The ''Moët-Hennessy • Louis Vuitton Chairman Bernard Arnualt in January 1998 for a profit of $140 million USD.<ref name="funding"/> Arnault was in fact attempting a full take over of Gucci: LVMH had been purchasing brands for a while and already owned Dior, Givenchy, and numerous other luxury brands). Gucci however managed to fend him of by selling a 45$stake to industrialist François Pinault, for $3 billion USD.<ref name="funding"/> In 1998, the first Prada menswear boutique is opened in Los Angeles.<ref name="fragrance"/>

Nevertheless, Prada was determined to become a leading holder of a portfolio of Luxury brands similar to the Gucci group and LVMH. 51 % of Fendi S.p.A.<ref name="funding"/> They did this to out beat Gucci, who had also wanted to purchase that share. Prada's half of that purchase (25.5%) was worth $241.5 million USD out of the reported $520 million USD total paid by both Prada and LVMH.<ref name="funding"/> However, Fendi was ailing and Prada took in debts as a result.

The past inquisitions truly rose Prada to the high ranks of European luxury goods groups.<ref name="funding"/> Revenue tripled from that of 1996, to  L 2 trillion. Despite apparent success, the company was in debt.<ref name="funding"/>

===A new look into the 21st century===
It suspended to merging and purchasing in 2000s, however, a loose agreement was signed in with Azzedine Alaia.<ref name="funding"/> Personal skin care products were introduced in the United States in October 2000 (a 30-day supply of cleansing lotion going for the retail price of $100 USD).<ref name="funding"/> To help pay of depts of over $850 million USD, the company planned on offering 30% of the company on the Milan Stock Exchange to the public on June 2001. However, the offering was slowed down after a decline in luxury goods spending in the United States and Japan. In 2001, under the pressure of his bankers, Bertelli also sold all of Prada's 25.5% share in Fendi to LVMH to help reduce Prada's debt. He raised only $295 million USD.<ref name="funding"/>

thumb|272px|Prada-Geschäft in Mailand
Die '''Prada''' SpA ist eine italienische Modefirma unter dem Dach des französischen Luxusgüterkonzerns LVMH mit Einzelhandelsgeschäften weltweit. Das Unternehmen, ursprünglich bekannt unter der Bezeichnung Fratelli Prada (Gebr. Prada), wurde 1913 von Mario Prada gegründet. Zunächst konzentrierte sich Prada auf die Herstellung und den Verkauf von Lederwaren. Im Jahre 1978 erbte die Enkelin des Firmengründers, Miuccia Prada, das Unternehmen von ihrer Mutter und begründete damit die Ausdehnung und den Erfolg zum Modeunternehmen.

Miuccia Prada erwarb sich ihr Ansehen und ihre Reputation durch den kreativen Umgang mit Stoffen und die schlichten, modernen Linien ihrer Kollektion von 1985 mit schwarz glänzenden Handtaschen aus Fallschirmnylon. Diese neuartigen Taschen waren sehr schnell überall heiß begehrt und brachten eine weltweite Fälscherindustrie von Produkten aus dem Hause Prada hervor.

Pradas erste Prêt-à-porter-Kollektion wurde von Miuccia Prada für die Herbst-/Winter-Saison von 1989 entworfen. Die schlichten und modernen Linien dieser Kollektion bildeten einen starken Kontrast zu den grellen und sexualisierten Entwürfen anderer Marken und führten zu einem steilen Anstieg der Popularität der Marke Prada.

In Ergänzung zur ursprünglichen Prada-Linie führte die Firma 1992 die Miu-Miu-Kollektion ein, eine preiswertere Linie für ein jüngeres Publikum. Die Miu-Miu-Linie, deren Namensgebung auf den Spitznamen von Miuccia Prada zurückgeht, betont Erdfarben und weniger einen Couture-Stil und weckt Erinnerungen an einen insgesamt eher unkonventionellen Stil. Die Miu-Miu-Linie nutzt in Werbekampagnen den Auftritt sehr junger Models in häuslicher Umgebung, um das Unkonventionelle dieser Modelinie noch besonders herauszustellen. Die Kleidung ist oft einfach und erinnert permanent an exklusive und gleichzeitig „altmodische“ Kleidung. Es folgte die Prada Sportkollektion.

Prada gelangte zu seiner modischen Vorrangstellung in den frühen 1990er-Jahren mit einem Look, der mit dicken Brillengläsern und grellen Farben assoziiert und unter dem Begriff „Prada Ugly“ bekannt wurde. Prada hat eine bestimmte und bewusst intellektuelle Annäherung an den Modebegriff. Der Look seit 2000 ist als der „Chic einer neofaschistischen Armee“ (New York Times) beschrieben worden.

Im Jahre 1993 gewann Prada die internationale Auszeichnung für modische Accessoires des Council of Fashion Designers of America.

Obwohl Prada nach wie vor Spitze im Bereich zeitgenössischer Mode bleibt, macht das Unternehmen den Großteil seines Umsatzes mit dem ursprünglichen Lederwarengeschäft, dem Verkauf von Schuhen und Handtaschen. Entsprechend wird von der Chefredakteurin der Vogue, Anna Wintour, erzählt, sie habe Miuccia Prada erzählt, dass sie „der einzige Grund sei, dass jemand nach Mailand zu den Modeschauen käme“.

Dem Trend anderer Unternehmen und Marken folgend, soviele Modehäuser wie nur irgend möglich aufzukaufen, nahm Prada hohe Schulden auf, um das finanziell angeschlagene, in Rom beheimatete Unternehmen Louis Vuitton Moet Hennesy (LVMH). Prada gelang es nicht, das defizitäre Fendi-Unternehmen in die Gewinnzone zu steuern, und verkaufte den Aktienanteil an LVMH. Prada hat sich finanziell von diesem Abenteuer noch nicht erholen können.
