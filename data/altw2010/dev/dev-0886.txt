'''Magdeburg''' (Low Saxon: ''Meideborg,'' ), the Bundesland'' of Otto I, the first Central and Protestant resistance during the Thirty Years' War.

== History ==

<!--PLEASE REWRITE THIS AS A STANDARD ARTICLE-->
In 919 King Magyars and Slavs. In 929 the city went to Edith, through her marriage with Henry's son Otto I, as a ''Morgengabe'' — a Germanic customary gift received by the new bride from the groom and his family after the wedding night. Edith loved the town and often lived there; she was buried in the abbey church crypt at her death. In 937, Magdeburg was the seat of a royal assembly. Otto I also continually returned to it. He granted the Benedictine abbey of Saint Maurice (later the cathedral) the right to income from various tithes and to corvée labor from the surrounding countryside.  Otto I was also buried in the cathedral. 

The Havelberg, Brandenburg, Merseburg, Meissen, and Zeitz-Naumburg. The archbishops played a prominent role in the German colonization of the Slavic lands east of the Elbe river.

In 1035 Magdeburg received a patent giving the city the right to hold trade exhibits and conventions, the basis of the later family of city laws known as Magdeburg rights. These laws were adopted and modified throughout Central and Eastern Europe. Visitors from many countries begin to trade in Magdeburg. In 1118 a fire almost destroyed it.

In the 13th century, Magdeburg became a member of the Brunswick). The citizens constantly struggled against the archbishop, becoming nearly independent from him by the end of the 15th century.

In 1524 Catholicism. The Charles V repeatedly outlawed the unruly town, which had joined the Alliance of Torgau and the Schmalkaldic League. Because it had not accepted the "Interim" (1548), the city, by the emperor's commands, was besieged (1550-1551) by Maurice, Elector of Saxony, but it retained its independence. The rule of the archbishop was replaced by that of various administrators belonging to Protestant dynasties. In the following years Magdeburg gained a reputation as a stronghold of Protestantism and became the first major city to publish the writings of Luther. In Magdeburg, Matthias Flacius and his companions wrote their anti-Catholic pamphlets and the ''Magdeburg Centuries'', in which they argued that the Roman Catholic Church had become the kingdom of the Anti-Christ. 

In 1631, during the imperial troops stormed the city and committed a massacre, killing about 20,000 inhabitants and burning the town in the August of Saxe-Weissenfels, as the semi-autonomous Duchy of Magdeburg; this occurred in 1680.

In the course of the French troops in 1806. The city was annexed to the French-controlled Treaty of Tilsit. King Jérôme appointed Count Heinrich von Blumenthal as mayor. In 1815, after the Napoleonic Wars, Magdeburg was made the capital of the new Prussian Province of Saxony. In 1912, the old fortress was dismantled.

The city became capital of the Province of Magdeburg near the end of World War II. Magdeburg, then a city of about 340,000 inhabitants, suffered near total destruction from Allied firebombing. The impressive ''Gründerzeit'' suburbs north of the city, called the Nordfront, were destroyed as well as the city's main street with its Baroque buildings. It was the second most devastated city in Germany; only Dresden suffered more. American and Soviet troops occupied the city; however, the Americans soon left, leaving the city under Soviet stewardship. 

In the postwar years, many of the remaining pre-World War II city buildings were destroyed, with only a few buildings near the cathedral restored to their pre-war state. Prior to the reunification of Germany, many surviving ''Gründerzeit'' buildings were left uninhabited and, after years of degradation, waiting for demolition. From 1949 on until German reunification on 3 October 1990, Magdeburg belonged to the German Democratic Republic.

In 1990 Magdeburg became the capital of the new state of Saxony-Anhalt within reunified Germany. The city center was rebuilt almost exclusively in a modern style. In recent years, a community currency, the Urstromtaler, has gone into circulation alongside the euro.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6333063.stm Germans take pride in local money]</ref>

=== Cathedral ===

Magdeburg's  most impressive building, the Protestant Cathedral of Saints Maurice, has a height of 104 m: the highest church building of eastern Germany. It is notable for its beautiful and unique sculptures, especially the "Twelve Virgins" at the Northern Gate, the depictions of Editha as well as the statues of Maurice was an Egyptian. It is in fact the oldest depiction of a black person in Europe.  St Catherine is dressed like a young teenage girl from the time of the statue's creation would have been - the equivalent to a girl in jeans and T-Shirt today. (Quite a scandal then.)

The predecessor of the cathedral was a church built in 937 within an abbey, called St. Maurice. Emperor Otto I the Great was buried here beside his wife in 973. St. Maurice burnt to ashes in 1207. The exact location of that church remained unknown for a long time. The foundations were rediscovered in May 2003, revealing a building 80 m long and 41 m wide.
