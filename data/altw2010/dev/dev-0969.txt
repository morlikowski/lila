'''Epitácio Lindolfo da Silva Pessoa''' (May 23, 1865 - February 13, 1942) was a Brazilian politician and jurist, and president of the republic between 1919 and 1922, when Rodrigues Alves could not take office due to illness after being elected in 1918. His period of government was marked by military revolts that would culminate in the Revolution of 1930, which brought Getúlio Vargas into control of the Federal Government.

In addition to his term as president, Pessoa served as Senator, Chief of the Brazilian delegation for the Treaty of Versailles and a judge on the Permanent Court of International Justice.

==Biography==
Pessoa was born in Paraíba, his parents died of smallpox when he was only seven years old. He was taken in and educated by his uncle Henrique de Lucena, the then governor of Pernambuco. Pessoa endured a very poor childhood, but with great effort managed to earn a degree in law. He went on to join the Faculty of Law at the University of Pernambuco as a professor. He eventually made his way to Rio de Janeiro.

Young Epitácio managed to make the acquaintance of Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca through the connections of his eldest brother José. With the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic he was invited by governor Venâncio Neiva to serve as secretary-general of the first republican government of Paraíba. He was a deputy to the constituent assembly from 1890 to 1891, during which time he was noted as a standout figure. By the time he was twenty five years old, he was already noted as an accomplished jurist.

During his time in the Constituent Assembly, Pessoa gave an outstanding speech where he articulated on the political responsibilities of the President of the Republic. In 1894, he resolved to abandon politics because of his disagreements with then president Floriano Peixoto. After marrying Maria da Conceição Manso Saião, he left for Europe.

After his return to Brazil he became Minister of Justice in the government of Campos Sales, during which time he invited Clóvis Beviláqua, a colleague from his days as a professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Recife, to write a civil code for the country that would eventually be adopted in 1916. After leaving the Ministry of Justice, Pessoa would then successively serve as Minister of Transportation, a Justice of the Supreme Federal Tribunal, and Attorney General of the Republic. Levi Carneiro, in his "Livro de um Advogado", notes that as a justice Pessoa never voted in favor of any case in which he had been assigned to elaborate the views of the court.

Elected as a senator for his home state of Paraíba in 1911, Pessoa moved to Europe where he would live until 1914. Returning to Brazil, he would soon assume the post of realtor for the Commission for the Verification of Powers.

With the end of the First World War, Pessoa was chosen to lead the Brazilian delegation for the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Ruy Barbosa had originally been chosen to lead the delegation, but he resigned and Pessoa was picked as his substitute. The Brazilian delegation, which supported the aims of the United States, obtained good results in its attempts to resolve issues that Brazil had an interest in: the sale of Brazilian coffee that had been stored in European ports, and the fate of 70 German ships seized by Brazil during the war. 

Pessoa disputed the succession of Delfim Moreira, the vice-president of president-elect Rodrigues Alves, who had died before he could take office. He won the presidency of the Republic by defeating the then septuagenarian Ruy Barbosa in a snap election without having even left France; the only such case in the whole history of the Brazilian republic. His candidacy had been supported in Minas Gerais, and was considered fairly symbolic. The election of a president from Paraíba represented a defeat for the old political system of café com leite, with the election of Marshal Hermes da Fonseca from Rio Grande do Sul a decade earlier being the only previous exception. Regardless, Pessoa still represented the intrests of the traditional oligarchies of Minas Gerais and São Paulo.

There is another view of this election however: The belief that after the death of Rodrigues Alves the elite of Minas Gerais and São Paulo wanted to choose a new candidate from outside their own ranks. That Artur Bernardes of Minas Gerais was elected president in the next election supports the theory that the oligarches had never lost control in the intervening years.

==Presidency==
Brazil had greatly improved its financial situation over the course of the First World War. The industrialized countries had been forced to concentrate all of their resources towards the arms industry. Brazil exported raw materials at compensatory prices and enlarged its industrial base, manufacturing products that were previously imported. With the end of the war, Europe began to rehabilitate its industries. At the same time, Brazil was befallen with a number of workers strikes, and the business community along with the coffee-growers tried to reimpose their control.  In response to this events Pessoa introduced a program of austere financial planning. Nevertheless, the pressures on the State continued to grow. New loans, totaling nine million pounds financed the retention of green coffee in Brazilian ports. Another loan was secured from the United States for the electrification of the Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil.  

Pessoa did not escape from the intrigues of state politics, and used the Federal Government to intervene on behalf of state-based interest groups in return for support in Congress. He was embroiled in one of the most troubled periods in the history of the Old Republic, with the outbreak of the 18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt on July, 5, 1922, the crisis of the false letters (see below) and the revolt of the Military Club. The process of finding a successor for Pessoa therefore happened within a highly charged climate where the lieutenants and subalterns (the Tenentes) of the Armed Forces called for profound political reforms.

== Leben ==

1873 verlor der junge Epitácio Pessoa seine Eltern durch den Ausbruch der Pocken. Er wurde an einer staatlichen Schule unterrichtet und von seinem Onkel Henrique Pereira de Lucena (Barão de Lucena), dem Gouverneur von Pernambuco, unterstützt. Er machte 1886 seinen Abschluss in Rechtswissenschaften und diente von 1887 bis 1889 als Anklagevertreter in Bom Jardim und in Cabo (Pernambuco). Nach Proklamation der Republik übernahm er zunächst Aufgaben im Staatsdienst der Provinz Paraíba. Vom 15. November 1898 bis zum 6. August 1901 war er Justiz- und Innenminister im Kabinett von Präsident Campos Sales und arbeitet an einem Entwurf für das sogenannte Código Civil. Vom 25. Januar 1902 bis zum 17. August 1912 gehört er dem Obersten Bundesericht (Supremo Tribunal Federal) an. Gleichzeitig war er vom 7. Juni 1902 bis zum 21. Oktober 1905 Anklagevertreter der Republik. Danach wurde er von 1912 bis 1916 zum Senator in Paraíba gewählt. Während er Brasilien auf der Pariser Friedenskonferenz 1919 vertritt, wird er am 13. April 1919 zum Präsidenten gewählt. In seiner Regierungszeit fiel der Kaffee-Preis um circa die Hälfte, was einen starken Einfluss auf die brasilianische Wirtschaft hatte. Zentrum der Opposition war der Bundesstaat Rio Grande do Sul, dessen Politiker mit denen aus den Bundesstaaten Bahia, Pernambuco und Rio de Janeiro die Reação Republicana gründeten, um die ''Kaffee-Oligarchie'' an der Wahl von Artur da Silva Bernardes zum nächsten Präsidenten zu hindern, was jedoch scheiterte.

Pessoa leidete in den letzten Jahren seines Lebens an der Parkinsonschen Krankheit.
