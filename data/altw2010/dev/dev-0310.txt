'''Slavonski Brod''' è una città della Sava nella regione storico-geografica della Slavonia. La città è il capoluogo della contea di Brod e della Posavina.

Slavonski Brod vuol dire "Brod slavona" (la nave (guado) della Slavonia), in opposizione a Bosanski Brod ("Brod bosniaca") che è la città della Bosnia-Erzegovina al di là del fiume. Nelle lingue slave in generale, la parola ''brod'' vuol dire "guado" e compare sovente nei nomi delle città sorte nei pressi di un fiume. Fino al 1934, la città si chiamava ''Brod na Savi'' ("Brod presso il fiume Sava").

Slavonski Brod è famosa per la sua fortezza barocca , [http://www.festungbrod.com/ "Festung"]  (la parola tedesca per fortezza) attualmente in ristrutturazione.
 
La città è un importante nodo per il traffico commerciale è infatti nodo ferroviario e stradale oltre a disporre di un porto fluviale. 

In epoca jugoslava era importante per la sua industria (specialmente ditta "Đuro Đaković") distrutte però nel corso della guerra degli anni '90.

'''Slavonski Brod''' is a city in Brodsko-Posavska county, and a Croatian, the city's name bears witness to an older meaning - 'water crossing'.

==Geography==
The city developed at the strategically important crossing over the Sava river towards Bosanski Brod in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is an important intersection of the Posavina part of the highway and a railway junction, since it is located on the highway linking Zagreb&ndash;Lipovac&ndash;Belgrade (E70, A3) and the Zagreb&ndash;Vinkovci&ndash;Belgrade railway. The ship port 'Brod' on the Sava river is under construction.

There is also new modern highway under construction, on the international transit route 5C, which will connect Northern Europe and Hungary with Croatia (region of Slavonia), Bosnia and Herzegovina and again Croatia (coastal region of Dalmatia). Alignment of this highway is some 16 km far away from the center of town. With completion of this route, the area of the town of Slavonski Brod will become one of the major highway intersections in this part of the Europe connecting directions west-east and north-south.
