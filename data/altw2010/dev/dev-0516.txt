'''Robert Abercrombie Lovett''' (Secretary of Defense, serving in the cabinet of President Domhoff described Lovett as a "Cold War architect".

==Early life==
The son of R.S. Lovett, president and chairman of the board of the Union Pacific Railroad, Lovett was born in Huntsville, Texas. He was a member of the Skull and Bones society at Yale University<ref>Alexandra Robbins, ''Secrets of the Tomb: Skull and Bones, the Ivy League, and the Hidden Paths of Power'', Little, Brown and Company, 2002, page 184-8.</ref> <ref>''Current Biography'', 1954, H.W. Wilson Company, page 29.</ref> where he graduated in 1918 and took postgraduate courses in law and business administration at Harvard University between 1919 and 1921. He married debutante Adele Quartley Brown April 19, 1919. As a naval ensign during World War I, Lovett flew for a time with the British Naval Air Service on patrol and combat missions and then commanded a U.S. naval air squadron, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander. 

Lovett began his business career as a clerk at the National Bank of Commerce in New York and later moved to Brown Brothers Harriman and Company, where he eventually became a partner and a prominent member of the New York business community. He remained interested in aeronautics, especially in European commercial and military aviation.

==Early government career==
In December 1940 Lovett accepted appointment as special assistant for air affairs to Secretary of War Secretary of War. Lovett served with distinction, overseeing the massive expansion of the Army Air Forces and the procurement of huge numbers of aircraft during Distinguished Service Medal in September 1945, President Harry Truman wrote: "He has truly been the eyes, ears and hands of the Secretary of War in respect to the growth of that enormous American airpower which has astonished the world and played such a large part in bringing the war to a speedy and successful conclusion." 

President Truman refused the resignation of Lovett and McCloy when they and Bundy gave their resignations in September 1945 but Lovett returned to Brown Brothers Harriman in December 1945 only to be called back to Washington a little more than a year later to serve with General Pentagon in September 1950. As deputy secretary of defense, Lovett played a critical role in the management of the department and he was instrumental in the creation of the CIA.

When Lovett became secretary of defense, the end of the Korean War was not yet in sight. His main concern continued to be the long-range rearmament program. Like Marshall, Lovett believed that the United States erred seriously at the end of World War II by disintegrating the military.

When the Korean conflict happened, he designed the rearmament program intended both to meet the demands of the Korean conflict and to serve as a deterrent and mobilization base in future military emergencies. As Lovett put it, "Heretofore this country has only had two throttle settings one, wide-open for war, and the other, tight-shut for peace. What we are really trying to do is to find a cruising speed."

Lovett argued for large monetary budgets to carry on the Korean conflict and to improve U.S. defensive strength, asking for large sums of money and arguing strenuously against additional congressional cuts, emphasizing the need to expand Army, Navy, and Marine Corps forces. He argued toward working toward a goal of 143 Air Force wings (as compared with 95 then authorized) and a larger military. Lovett did not get all that he wanted. The actual amount his department received for 1953 came to about $44.2 billion, almost $13 billion less than the previous year. He had asked for initially $71 billion, later reducing his requests to $49 billion.

Lovett's efforts to meet rearmament and preparedness goals suffered in 1952 from a major dispute between the federal government and the steel industry. Truman tried to avert a threatened strike, caused mainly by a wage dispute, by taking over the steel mills in April 1952. The strike occurred after the Supreme Court overruled Truman's seizure order. Lovett supported the president's action as essential to maintaining defense production and expressed serious concern about the strike's effects on the nation's military capabilities. Even so, he noted that "the last six months of 1952 saw the most significant increases in the military effectiveness of the United States since the beginning of partial mobilization."

By the end of the Truman administration, the Defense Department had met successfully the challenges of the Korean War mobilization and embarked on a long-term preparedness effort.

Besides the preparedness issue, Lovett inherited a number of other matters that were still unresolved in the early 1950s, including the proper military role of nuclear weapons. Lovett's stands on the nuclear weapons question and other major military issues generally followed those of his predecessors. He strongly supported universal military training, regarding it as the only viable long-term approach to building a reserve force, and thus making possible a smaller regular military establishment. A firm proponent of NATO, he played an important role when the NATO Council in February 1952 adopted force goals totaling 50 divisions and 4,000 aircraft to be achieved at the end of 1952.

'''Robert Abercrombie Lovett''', född den Huntsville, Locust Valley, New York, var amerikansk affärsman och politiker.

Han var son till R.S. Lovett, vd för Union Pacific Railroad. Lovett studerade vid Yale University och var medlem i sällskapet Skull and Bones. Därefter fortsatte han sina studier i juridik och företagsekonomi vid Harvard University. Lovett deltog i första världskriget.

Han inledde sin karriär på National Bank of Commerce i New York och gick sedan över till Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. I december 1940 utnämndes han till krigsminister Henry L. Stimsons specialmedarbetare och fyra månader senare till biträdande krigsminister. I december 1945 återvände han till Brown Brothers Harriman.

När general George C. Marshall utnämndes till USA:s utrikesminister 1947, blev Lovett biträdande utrikesminister. När Marshall lämnade utrikesdepartementet 1949, var det igen dags för Lovett att återvända till näringslivet. I september 1950 ville Marshall som ny försvarsminister åter ha Lovett som sin medarbetare. Lovetts tid som vice försvarsminister blev kort, redan ett år senare lämnade Marshall politiken för gott och Lovett tillträdde som USA:s försvarsminister i stället.
