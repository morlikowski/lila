The '''French Third Republic''' (in French, <span lang="fr">''La Troisième République''</span>, sometimes written as <span lang="fr">''La III<sup>e</sup> République''</span>) (Vichy Regime. It was a republican parliamentary democracy that was created on Napoleon III in the invasion of France by the German Third Reich in 1940. <span lang="fr">Republic in the 1870s, called republicanism in the 1870s "the form of government that divides France least." France might have agreed about being a republic, but it never fully agreed with the Third Republic. France's longest lasting régime since before the 1789 French Revolution, the Third Republic was consigned to the history books, as unloved at the end as it had been when first created seventy years earlier. But its longevity showed that it was capable of weathering many a storm.

== Background ==
In 1852, Emperor of the French, following the earlier example of his uncle Napoleon I. However, the Second French Empire lasted only eighteen years because of the emergence of the German Empire, which quickly grew to dominate continental affairs after defeating the French in the Franco-Prussian War.

Prime Minister <span lang="de">Sedan</span>, Parisian Deputies established the Government of National Defence, governed in Paris by the President, General <span lang="fr">Louis Jules Trochu</span>, and in the provinces by the Minister of the Interior, <span lang="fr">Léon Gambetta</span>. After the French surrender in January 1871, the Government of National Defence disbanded and returned power to the National Assembly based at <span lang="fr">Versailles</span>. The new government under <span lang="fr">Adolphe Thiers</span> was overshadowed by the settlement of peace terms with Prussia and the subsequent revolution in Paris known as the Paris Commune, which maintained a radical regime for two months until its bloody suppression by <span lang="fr">Thiers</span>' government in May 1871. The following repression of the <span lang="fr">''communards''</span> would have disastrous consequences on the labor movement.

== Prospects of a Parliamentary Monarchy ==

In the aftermath of the collapse of the regime of Napoleon III, the clear majority of French people and the overwhelming majority of the French National Assembly wished to return to a Charles X</span>, recognising as king his grandson, <span lang="fr">Louis Philippe</span>, recognising as king his grandson, <span lang="fr">Louis-Philippe, Comte de Paris</span>. However the two groups came to a compromise, whereby the childless <span lang="fr">Comte de Chambord</span> would be recognised as king, with the <span lang="fr">Comte de Paris</span> recognised as his heir. Consequently in 1871, the throne was offered to the <span lang="fr">Comte de Chambord</span>. In 1830 <span lang="fr">Charles X</span> had abdicated in favour of <span lang="fr">Chambord</span>, then a child (his father having died already), and <span lang="fr">Louis-Philippe</span> had been recognised as king instead.

In 1871 <span lang="fr">Chambord</span> had no wish to be a ''constitutional'' monarch, but a semi-absolutist one like his grandfather <span lang="fr">Charles X</span>, or like the contemporary rulers of Prussia/Germany. Moreover, he refused to reign over a state that used the <span lang="fr">Tricouleur</span> that was associated with the Revolution of 1789 and the Louis Philippe</span>, ''King of the French''. This became the ultimate reason the restoration never occurred. As much as France wanted a restored monarchy, the nation was unwilling to abandon the popular <span lang="fr">''Tricouleur''</span>. Instead a "temporary" republic was established, to await the death of the elderly, childless <span lang="fr">Chambord</span>, when the throne could be offered to his more liberal heir, the <span lang="fr">Comte de Paris</span>.  However, <span lang="fr">Chambord </span> lived until 1883, by which time enthusiasm for a monarchy had faded.

== The <span lang="fr">''Ordre Moral''</span> Government ==
In February 1875, a series of parliamentary Acts established the organic or constitutional laws of the new republic. At its apex was a ''President of the Republic''. A two-chamber parliament was created, along with a ministry under the "President of the Council", who was nominally answerable to both the President of the Republic and parliament. Throughout the 1870s, the issue of monarchy versus republic dominated public debate. 

On Duc de Broglie</span> to office. He then dissolved parliament and called a general election (October 1877). If his hope had been to halt the move towards republicanism, it backfired spectacularly, with the President being accused of having staged a ''constitutional <span lang="fr">coup d'état</span>'', known as  <span lang="fr">''le seize Mai''</span> after the date on which it happened. 

Republicans returned triumphant, finally killing off the prospect of a restored French monarchy by gaining control of the Senate on 5 January 1879. <span lang="fr">MacMahon</span> himself resigned on 30 January 1879, leaving a seriously weakened presidency in the shape of <span lang="fr">Jules Grévy</span>. Indeed it was not until <span lang="fr">Charles de Gaulle</span>, eighty years later, that a President of France next unilaterally dissolved parliament.

== The Opportunist Republicans ==

Following the 16 May crisis in 1877, (laїque)''</span> public education, voted in 1881 and 1882, were one of the first sign of this republican control of the Republic, as public education was not anymore in the exclusive control of the Catholic congregations.

<!-- ANECDOTICAL: To mark the final end of French monarchism as a serious political force, in 1885 the French Crown Jewels were broken up and sold. Only a few crowns, their precious gems replaced by coloured glass, were kept. --> 

In 1889 the Republic was rocked by the sudden but short-timed <span lang="fr">Boulanger</span> crisis, while the Dreyfus Affair was another important event, spawning the rise of the modern intellectual (<span lang="fr">Emile Zola</span>). Later, the Panama scandals also were quickly criticized by the press.

In 1893, following National Assembly, killing nobody but injuring one, deputies voted the <span lang="fr">''Sadi Carnot</span> was stabbed to death by the Italian anarchist <span lang="it">Sante Geronimo Caserio</span>. Also in 1894, 30 alleged anarchists were judged during the Trial of the thirty.

== The Radicals' Republic == 
 

The Radical-Socialist Party, founded in 1901 (four years before the socialist <span lang="fr">SFIO</span> which unified the various socialist currents), remained the most important party of the Third Republic starting at the end of the 19th century. The same year, followers of <span lang="fr">Léon Gambetta</span>, such as <span lang="fr">Raymond Poincaré</span>, who would become President of the Council in the 1920s, created the Democratic Republican Alliance (ARD), which became the main center-right party after World War I and the parliamentary disappearance of monarchists and Bonapartists.

Governments during the Third Republic collapsed with regularity, rarely lasting more than a couple of months, as radicals, socialists, liberals, conservatives, republicans and monarchists all fought for control. However others argue that the collapse of governments were a minor side effect of the Republic lacking strong political parties, resulting in coalitions of many parties that routinely lost and gained a few allies. Consequently the change of governments could be seen as little more than a series of ministerial reshuffles, with many individuals carrying forward from one government to the next, often in the same posts.

In 1905 the government introduced the law on the separation of Church and State, heavily supported by <span lang="fr">Emile Combes</span>, who had been strictly enforcing the 1901 voluntary association law and the 1904 law on religious congregations' freedom of teaching (more than 2,500 private teaching establishments were by then closed by the state, causing bitter opposition from the Catholic and conservative population).

==Political and Military Scandals of the 1890s==
There were two major scandals that rocked the Third Republic during the 1890s. One scandal entailed the Panama scandals in 1892. Due to widespread corruption, the company designated to spearhead the massive project went bankrupt. Approximately 300 million dollars were lost in the financial fiasco . Adjusted for inflation, that loss would have amounted to around six billion dollars by today's account . The role of French politicians in the scandal severely undermined the ability of the French government to regulate the enormous power of the bourgeoisie. 

The Dreyfus Affair was another, famous scandal, which involved the French military. In 1894, a Jewish artillery officer, Alfred Dreyfus, was arrested on charges relating to conspiracy and espionage. Allegedly, Dreyfus had handed over important military documents discussing the designs of a new French artillery piece to a German military attaché named Max von Schwartzkoppen. In 1898, writer Emile Zola published an article entitled ''J'Accuse. ..!'' (I accuse. ..!). The article alleged an anti-Semitic conspiracy in the highest ranks of the military to scapegoat Dreyfus, tacitly supported by the government and the Catholic Church. By 1906 however, it became apparent that the documents handed over to Schwartzkoppen were a forgery and thus Dreyfus was pardoned after serving twelve years behind bars.

== France and the First World War ==

One of the reasons for France's entrance in World War I was, in patriotic circles and in most of the political class, to avenge its defeat during the colonial lobby," gathering a few politicians, businessmen and geographers favorable to colonialism, until 1918. Thus, <span lang="fr">Radical), declared that colonialism diverted France from the "blue line of the <span lang="fr">republican), <span lang="fr">Léon Gambetta</span> (republican), and <span lang="fr">Eugène Etienne</span>, the president of the parliamentary colonial group. 

Another reason pertaining to France's entrance into the Lord Lansdowne, the British Foreign Secretary, the <span lang="fr">Entente Cordiale</span> in 1904. These entangling alliances not only tied France to various unwanted foreign crises but also made Germany feel increasingly encircled.

After <span lang="fr">pacifist leader <span lang="fr">SFIO socialist party's support in the <span lang="fr">''censorship imposed, leading to the creation in 1915 of the <span lang="fr">''liberal theories of non-interventionism.  	

After the outbreak of the war in August 1914, France enjoyed relatively little success. In order to uplift the French national spirit, many mutinies along the Front. According to French historian Leonard V. Smith, as many as thirty-thousand French soldiers engaged in mutinous activities during 1917 alone.<ref>Leonard V. Smith et al., ''France and the Great War 1914-1918'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 122.</ref> Still, the French government, led by <span lang="fr">Clemenceau</span>, insisted on victory at all costs and therefore the French persisted in their efforts to defeat the Germans.

== The Downfall of the Third Republic ==
Throughout its seventy-year history, the Third Republic stumbled from crisis to crisis, from dissolved parliaments to the appointment of a mentally ill regime of Vichy ("the French state"), which replaced the Republic.

The second idea regarding the collapse of the Third Republic involves the poor German armistice signed on June 22, 1940 in the same railway carriage where the Germans had signed the armistice ending the First World War back in November 1918.<ref>Julian Jackson, ''The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003), 181.</ref>

When France was finally liberated after the constitution for a successor, established as the Fourth Republic that December. The Fourth Republic would last only twelve years as 1958 saw the drafting of a Fifth French Constitution and thus the beginning of the French Fifth Republic, which has subsequently survived to this day.
