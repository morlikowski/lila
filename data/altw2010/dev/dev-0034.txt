'''Thủy lôi''' còn gọi là '''mìn Hải Quân''' là một loại mìn được đặt trong nước để tiêu diệt các loại tàu thuyền. Từ khi thả xuống nước chúng sẽ nằm chờ đến khi, do tàu thuyền đến gần, sẽ tự bị kích nổ. Thủy lôi có thể sử dụng để tấn công nhờ việc cản trở tàu thuyền của đối phương phải nằm lại cảng; hoặc để phòng thủ nhằm bảo vệ các tàu thuyền của đồng minh và tạo ra một khu vực "an toàn".

Do được thả trong nước, để tránh sự dịch chuyển do tác động của các dòng nước xô đẩy từ các phía, thủy lôi thường có dạng tròn. Ngoài ra, để gia tăng tính cố định cho thủy lôi, một số dây cột được sử dụng giữ thủy lôi lơ lửng trong nước, không nổi lên bề mặt để dễ bị phát hiện nhưng cũng không chìm dưới đáy sông hay biển khiến hiệu quả bị suy giảm. Cũng vì được thả ngầm trong nước, xác xuất để va chạm với tàu thuyền khá nhỏ, thủy lôi hiện đại phải thiết kế thêm thiết bị cảm ứng để tự bị kích nổ khi tàu thuyền đến gần, và thường có kích thước lớn, chứa một lượng nổ rất mạnh. Các đầu nổ của thủy lôi thường dựa vào cảm ứng với tác động mạnh của làn nước, với kim loại, với từ trường khi tàu thuyền đi qua v.v.

Thủy lôi thường được thả nhiều, tạo thành những bãi mìn ngầm dưới mặt nước biển rất nguy hiểm, nhằm phong tỏa các khu vực trọng yếu, như các luồng tàu thuyền của đối phương, các bến cảng.

A '''naval mine''' is a self-contained explosive device placed in water to destroy ships or submarines. Unlike depth charges, mines are deposited and left to wait until they are triggered by the approach of or  contact with an enemy ship. Naval mines can be used offensively, to hamper enemy ships or lock them into a harbour; or defensively, to protect friendly ships and create "safe" zones.

Mines can be laid in many ways: by purpose-built minelayers, refitted ships, submarines, or airplanes—and even by dropping them into a harbour by hand. They can be inexpensive: some variants can cost as little as a thousand United States dollars (USD), although more sophisticated mines can cost millions of USD, be equipped with several kinds of sensors, and deliver a warhead by rocket or torpedo. 

Their flexibility and cost-effectiveness make mines attractive weapons to the less powerful belligerent in asymmetric warfare. The cost of producing and laying a mine is usually anywhere from 0.5% to 10% of the cost of removing it, and it can take up to 200 times as long to clear a minefield as to lay it. 
Parts of some World War II naval minefields still exist, because they are too extensive and expensive to clear; some of these mines might remain dangerous for hundreds of years. 

There are three main uses of mines: offensive, defensive and psychological. Offensive mines are placed in enemy waters, outside harbours and in important shipping routes to sink civilian and military ships. Defensive minefields protect a coast from enemy ships and submarines and force them into areas that are easier to defend. Minefields designed for psychological effect are usually placed in trade routes and are used to stop shipping to an enemy nation. They are also spread out thinly, to create a feeling of random minefields in large areas. A single mine along a shipping route can stop shipping for days until the entire area is swept.

International law requires nations to declare when they mine an area, in order to make it easier for civil shipping to avoid the mines. The warnings do not have to be specific; during World War II, Britain declared simply that it had mined the English Channel, North Sea, and French coast.

== History ==
thumb|right|180px|A 14th century drawn illustration of a naval mine and page description from the ''[[Huolongjing''.]]
The precursor to naval mines was first described by the early Ming Dynasty Chinese artillery officer Jiao Yu, in his 14th century military treatise known as the ''Huolongjing''.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 203 205">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 203-205.</ref> Chinese records tell of naval explosives in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, used to fight against Japanese pirates (Wokou). This kind of naval mine was loaded in a wooden box, sealed by putty. General Qi Jiguang made several timed explosive drifting explosives to harass Japanese pirate ships.<ref></ref> However, in the ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' ('The Exploitation of the Works of Nature') treatise, written by Song Yingxing in 1637 AD, it describes naval mines with a rip cord pulled by a hidden ambusher located on the nearby shore which rotated a steel wheellock flint mechanism to produce sparks and ignite the fuse of the naval mine.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 205">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 205.</ref> Although this is the rotating steel wheellock's first use with naval mines, Jiao Yu had described their use for land mines back in the 14th century.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 199">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 199.</ref>

The first plan for a sea mine in the West was by Ralph Rabbards, who presented his design to Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1574.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 205">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 205.</ref> The Dutch inventor Cornelius Drebbel was employed in the Office of Ordnance by King Charles I of England to make weapons, including a "floating petard" which proved a failure.<ref></ref> Weapons of this type were apparently tried by the English at the Siege of La Rochelle in 1627.<ref></ref>

American David Bushnell invented the first practical mine, for use against the British in the American War of Independence. It was a watertight keg filled with gunpowder that was floated toward the enemy, detonated by a percussion lock if it struck a ship.

In 1812 Russian engineer Pavel Shilling exploded an underwater mine using an electrical circuit. In 1854, during the unsuccessful attempt of the Anglo-French fleet to seize Kronshtadt fortress, British steamships HMS ''Merlin'', HMS ''Vulture'' and HMS ''Firefly'' were damaged by underwater explosions of Russian naval mines. More than 1500 naval mines, or ''infernal machines'', designed by Moritz von Jacobi were set by Russian naval specialists in the Gulf of Finland during the Crimean War.

The USS ''Cairo'' in 1862 in the Yazoo River.  Rear Admiral David Farragut's famous statement, "Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!" refers to a minefield laid at Mobile, Alabama.

In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, mines were called H. L. Hunley'' used one to sink the USS ''Housatonic'' on February 17, 1864. A Harvey Torpedo was a type of floating mine towed alongside a ship, and was briefly in service in the Royal Navy in the 1870s. Other "torpedoes" attached to ships or propelled themselves. One such weapon, called the Whitehead Torpedo after its inventor, caused the word "torpedo" to be used for self-propelled underwater missiles rather than static devices.

The next major use of mines was in the Petropavlovsk'', killing the fleet commander, Admiral Makaroff, and most of the crew. On the other side, two Japanese battleships were sunk by Russian mines in one day.

Many early mines were fragile and dangerous to handle, with glass containers filled with nitroglycerin or mechanical devices that activated them upon tipping. Several mine-laying ships were destroyed when their cargo exploded.

The U-boat fleet, which dominated much of the battle of the Atlantic, was small at the beginning of the war and much of the early action by German forces involved mining convoy routes and ports around Britain. The German submarines also operated in the Mediterranean Sea, in the Caribbean Sea, and along the U.S. coast.

Initially contact mines were employed&nbsp;&mdash; meaning that a ship had to physically strike a mine to detonate it&nbsp;&mdash; usually tethered at the end of a cable just below the surface of the water. By the beginning of World War II most nations had developed mines that could be dropped from aircraft and  floated on the surface, making it possible to lay them in enemy harbors. The use of dredging and nets was effective against this type of mine, but this consumed time and resources, and required harbors to be closed. Contact mines usually hole ship's hulls

Later some ships survived mine blasts, limping into port with buckled plates and broken backs. This appeared to be due to a new type of mine, detecting ships magnetically and detonating at a distance, causing damage with the shock wave of the explosion. Ships that had successfully run the gauntlet of the Atlantic crossing were sometimes destroyed entering freshly cleared British harbors. More shipping was being lost than could be replaced, and Churchill ordered that the intact recovery of one of these new mines was of the highest priority.

The British experienced a stroke of luck in November 1939. A German mine was dropped from an aircraft onto the mud flats of the milligauss. 

From these data, methods were developed to clear the mines. Early methods included the use of large electromagnets dragged behind ships or below low-flying aircraft (a number of older bombers like the Vickers Wellington were used for this). Both of these methods had the disadvantage of "sweeping" only a small strip. A better solution was found in the "Double-L Sweep" <ref></ref> using electrical cables dragged behind ships that passed large pulses of current through the seawater. This induced a large magnetic field and swept the entire area between the two ships. The older methods continued to be used in smaller areas. The Suez Canal continued to be swept by aircraft, for instance.

While these methods were useful for clearing mines from local ports, they were of little or no use for enemy-controlled areas. These were typically visited by warships, and the majority of the fleet then underwent a massive degaussing process, where their hulls had a slight "south" bias induced into them which offset the concentration effect almost to zero.

Initially, major warships and large troopships had a copper ''degaussing coil'' fitted around the perimeter of the hull, energized by the ship's electrical system whenever in suspected magnetic-mined waters. Some of the first to be so-fitted were the carrier HMS ''Ark Royal'' and the liners  and , which were used as troopships. This was felt to be impracticable for the myriad of smaller warships and merchant vessels, not least due to the amount of copper that would be required. It was found that "wiping" a current-carrying cable up and down a ship' hull <ref></ref> temporarily canceled the ships' magnetic signature sufficiently to nullify the threat. This started in late 1939, and by 1940 merchant vessels and the smaller British warships were largely immune for a few months at a time until they once again built up a field. Many of the boats that sailed to Dunkirk were degaussed in a marathon four day effort by degaussing stations.

The Germans had also developed a pressure-activated mine and planned to deploy it as well, but they saved it for later use when it became clear the British had defeated the magnetic system.

Since World War II, mines have damaged or sunk 14 United States Navy ships, whereas air and missile attacks have damaged four. During the Korean War, mines laid by North Korean forces damaged 11 U.S. naval vessels.

During the USS ''Samuel B. Roberts'' (FFG-58) struck an Iranian M-08/39 mine in the central Gulf shipping lane, wounding 10 sailors.

During the USS ''Princeton'' (CG-59) and USS ''Tripoli'' (LPH-10).

== Types ==
Naval mines may be classified into two major groups.

=== Contact mines ===
The earliest mines were usually of this type. They are still used today, as they are extremely low cost compared to any other anti-ship weapon and are effective, both as a terror weapon and to sink enemy ships. Contact mines need to be very close to the target before they detonate, limiting the damage to the direct effects of the explosion and usually affecting only the single vessel that triggers them. (Read the section on damage below for explanation).

Early mines had mechanical mechanisms to detonate them, but these were superseded in the 1870s by the '''Hertz Horn''' (or '''chemical horn'''), which was found to work reliably even after the mine had been in the sea for several years. The mine's upper half is studded with hollow lead protuberances, each containing a glass vial filled with battery which until then contains no acid electrolyte. This energizes the battery, which detonates the explosive.

Earlier forms of the detonator used a vial filled with sulfuric acid, surrounded by a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar. When the vial was crushed, the acid ignited the perchlorate-sugar mix, and the resulting flame ignited the gunpowder charge.

During American invention, the antenna mine, was widely used. This had a copper wire attached to a buoy that floated above the mine. The top part of the cable connecting the mine to the weight on the seabed was also made of copper. The copper wire was insulated from the steel cable below it. If a submarine's steel hull touched the copper wire, the slight voltage produced because of the contact between two dissimilar metals was amplified and detonated the explosive.

==== Limpet mines ====<!-- This section is linked from The Red Sea Sharks -->
Limpet mines are a special form of contact mine which are attached to the target by magnets and left, and are so named because of the superficial similarity to the swimmer or diver may attach the mine, which is usually designed with hollow compartments to give the mine a slight negative buoyancy, making it easier to handle underwater. Normally they are directly attached, but the warhead of the human torpedo was linked to the magnets by wires about one foot (30 cm) long.

Usually limpet mines are set off by a time <!-- The correct spelling is FUZE. Read the hyperlink to understand why -->Fuse_%28explosives%29. They may also have an anti-removal system making the mine explode if removed from the hull by enemy divers or by explosions. Sometimes the limpet mine was fitted with a small propeller which would detonate the mine after the ship had sailed a certain distance, so that it was likely to sink in navigable channels or deep water out of reach of easy salvage and making it harder to determine the cause of the sinking.

A British limpet mine was developed by Stuart MacRae (editor of 'Science Armchair Magazine') and Major C.V. Clarke in 1939 using improvised development techniques.<ref></ref><ref>MacRae 1971</ref>

An example of the use of limpet mines by British special forces was in Operation Frankton which had the objective of disabling and sinking merchant shipping moored at Bordeaux, France in 1942. The operation was the subject of the film ''The Cockleshell Heroes''. The "limpets" used by the British during World War II contained only 4 kg of explosive, but placed 2 meters below the water line they caused a one meter wide hole in an unarmoured ship.

In 1980 a limpet mine was used to sink the ''Sierra'',<ref></ref> a pirate whaling vessel which docked in hiding in Portugal after a confrontation with Sea Shepherd, both exposing the Portuguese government for lying to international Governments about it being a safe haven for illegal whalers and encouraging a worldwide backlash against whaling in general. Later that year about half the Spanish whaling fleet was sunk in a similar fashion<ref></ref>. Rewards were also offered for the safe sinking of whaling vessels by various anti-whaling organisations.

Another notorious use was the sinking of the ''Rainbow Warrior'' by the French DGSE in Auckland harbour, New Zealand, on July 10 1985 to prevent them bringing attention to the nuclear testing underway.

====Moored contact mines ====
thumb|A German contact mine laid in [[Axis naval activity in Australian waters|Australian waters during World War II]]
Generally, this mine type is set to float just below the surface of the water or as deep as five meters. A steel cable connecting the mine to an anchor on the seabed prevents it from drifting away. The explosive and detonating mechanism is contained in a buoyant metal or plastic shell. The depth below the surface at which the mine floats can be set so that only deep draft vessels such as aircraft carriers, battleships or large cargo ships are at risk, saving the mine from being used on a less valuable target. In littoral waters it is important to ensure that the mine does not become visible when the sea level falls at low tide, so the preset cable length is adjusted to take account of tides. Even at the time of the Second World War there were mines which could be moored in 300-metre-deep water.

Floating mines typically have a weight of around 200 kg, including 80 kg of explosives e.g. TNT, minol or amatol.

During WWII mine traps were used for blocking port entrances. Two floating mines were anchored some distance apart on either side of a shipping channel, linked by a chain. When a deep draft vessel passed through the trap it would pull the chain along with it, dragging the mines onto the sides of the ship; the resulting double explosion often sank it. This system was not used extensively, but proved effective in blocking ports.

==== Drifting contact mines ====
Drifting mines were occasionally used during Admiral Jellicoe's British fleet did not pursue and destroy the outnumbered German High Seas Fleet when it turned away at the Battle of Jutland because he thought they were leading him into a trap: he believed it possible that the Germans were either leaving floating mines in their wake, or were drawing him towards submarines, although neither of these was the case.

Churchill promoted "Operation Royal Marine" in 1940 and again in 1944 where floating mines were put into the Rhine in France to float down the river, becoming active after a time calculated to be long enough to reach German territory.

After World War I the drifting contact mine was banned, but was occasionally used during World War II. The drifting mines were much harder to remove than tethered mines after the war, and they caused about the same damage to both sides.

==== Bottom contact mines ====
A bottom contact mine is the simplest form of mine. It is merely an explosive charge with some form of fuze fitted lying on the seafloor. They have been used against submarines, as submarines sometimes lie on the seafloor to reduce their acoustic signature. They are also used to prevent landing craft from reaching the shore and were a major obstacle during the D-Day landings. The Germans used antitank mines here with minor modifications to make them more reliable underwater, attaching the mines to the front of many of the obstacles seen in photos of the landing.

These mines usually weighed 2 to 50 kg, including 1 to 40 kg of explosives (TNT or hexatonal).

===Remotely controlled mines===
Frequently used in combination with coastal artillery and hydrophones, remote controlled (or command detonation) mines can be in place in peacetime, which is a huge advantage in blocking important shipping routes. The mines can usually be turned into "normal" mines with a switch (which prevents the enemy from simply capturing the controlling station and deactivating the mines), detonated on a signal or be allowed to detonate on their own. The earliest ones were developed around 1812 by Robert Fulton. The first remotely controlled mines were moored mines used in the American Civil War, detonated electrically from shore. They were considered superior to contact mines because they did not put friendly shipping at risk. 

Modern examples usually weigh 200 kg (440 lb), including 80 kg (175 lb) of explosives (TNT or hexatonal).

===Influence mines ===
These mines are triggered by the influence of a ship or submarine, rather than direct contact. Such mines incorporate electronic sensors designed to detect the presence of a vessel and blast range of the fuzes <!-- The correct spelling is FUZE. Read the hyperlink to understand why -->on such mines may incorporate one or more of the following sensors: magnetic, passive acoustic or water pressure displacement caused by the proximity of a vessel. 

First used during the fuzess has increased considerably over the years as first propellor) and ignore all others. The sophistication of modern electronic mine fuzes incorporating these Digital Signal Processing capabilities makes it much more difficult to detonate the mine with electronic countermeasures because several sensors working together (e.g. magnetic, passive acoustic and water pressure) allow it to ignore signals which are not recognised as being the signature of an intended target vessel.

Modern influence mines are detonating when a very large enemy target passes over it. Alternatively, the mine can be programmed specifically to ignore all surface vessels regardless of size and exclusively target submarines. 

Even as far back as the mine-sweepers deliberately trying to trigger mines) but fuze powers up fully and the passive acoustic sensors will begin to operate for some minutes. Obviously, it is possible to program computerised mines to delay activation for days or weeks after being laid. Similarly, they can be programmed to self-destruct or render themselves safe after a preset period of time e.g. 12 days or 12 months. As a general rule of thumb, the more sophisticated the mine design, the more likely it is to have some form of anti-handling device fitted in order to hinder clearance by divers or remotely piloted submersibles.

====Moored mines ====
The moored mine is the backbone of modern mine systems. They are deployed where water is too deep for bottom mines. They can use several kinds of instruments to detect an enemy, usually a combination of acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors, or more sophisticated optical shadows or electro potential sensors. These cost many times more than contact mines. Moored mines are effective against most kinds of ships. As they are cheaper than other anti-ship weapons they can be deployed in large numbers, making them useful area denial or "channelizing" weapons. 
Moored mines usually have lifetimes of more than 10 years, and some almost unlimited. These mines usually weigh 200 kg (440 lb), including 80 kg (175 lb) of explosives (hexatonal). In excess of 150 kg (330 lb) of explosives the mine becomes inefficient, as it becomes too large to handle and the extra explosives add little to the mine's effectiveness.

====Bottom mines ====
Bottom mines are used when the water is no more than 60 meters (180 ft) deep or when mining for submarines down to around 200 meters (660 ft). They are much harder to detect and sweep, and can carry a much larger warhead than a moored mine. Bottom mines commonly use pressure sensitive exploders, which are less sensitive to sweeping.

These mines usually weigh between 150 and 1,500 kilograms (330 to 3,300 pounds), including between 125 and 1,400 kg (275 to 3,090 pounds) of explosives.

===Unusual mines===

Several specialized mines have been developed for other purposes than the common minefield.

;Anti sweep mine
The anti sweep mine is a very small mine (40 kg warhead) with as small a floating device as possible. When the wire of a mine sweep hits the mine, it "sinks", letting the sweep wire drag along the anchoring wire of the mine until the sweep hits the mine. That detonates the mine and cuts the sweeping wire. They are very cheap and usually used in combination with other mines in a minefield to make sweeping more difficult.

;Rocket mine
A Russian invention, the rocket mine is a bottom distance mine that fires a homing high-speed rocket (not torpedo) upwards towards the target. It is intended to allow a bottom mine to attack surface ships as well as submarines from a greater depth.

;Torpedo mine
The fuzes.

The U.S. Mark 24 "mine", code-named FIDO, was actually an ASW homing torpedo. The mine designation was disinformation to conceal its function.

;Bouquet mine
The bouquet mine is a single anchor attached to several floating mines. It is designed so that when one mine is swept/detonated, another takes its place. It is a very sensitive construction and lacks reliability.

;Ascending mine
The ascending mine is a floating distance mine that may cut its mooring or in some other way float higher when it detects a target. It lets a single floating mine cover a much larger depth range.
