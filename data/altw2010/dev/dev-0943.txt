'''Paul Aaron Scholes''' (born English football player who has spent his whole career at Manchester United. Scholes has been called the best midfielder of his generation,<ref></ref> and was praised for his modesty and attitude towards the game.<ref></ref>

Scholes represented England for a period of seven years, having been handed his début in 1997. He went on to represent his country at four major tournaments; the 1998 and 2002 World Cups and the 2000 and 2004 European Championships. Following Euro 2004, Scholes announced his retirement from international football, citing his intentions to focus on his club career with Manchester United and spend more time with his family. Scholes went to Cardinal Langley Roman Catholic High School in Middleton Manchester. At his final period of school he was selected to represent Great Britain National Schools in Football. 

Netherlands star Edgar Davids called him the best midfielder in the world.<ref></ref>

==Club career==
Born in Oldham Athletic supporter, but has trained with Manchester United since the age of 14<ref name="observer best"></ref>. He then later joined as a trainee upon leaving the Middleton, Old Trafford team until the 1994–95 season, when he made 17 league appearances and scored five goals. His debut for the senior squad came on 21 September 1994, where he scored twice in a 3-2 victory over Port Vale in the League Cup. The 20-year-old Scholes proved himself to be a promising understudy for the likes of Eric Cantona and Andrew Cole and by 1996-97, Scholes reinvented himself somewhat from a striker to that of a midfielder and forward attacker, renowned for his slick passing and sharp mind in the game. However, this confusion about Scholes' natural positioning meant he was unable to secure a regular first team place until the 1997–98 season, when he played officially in midfield after the ninth game when Roy Keane was ruled out by injury.

In 1998–99, Scholes was a key player in Manchester United's Premiership title, Treble" success. He scored one of United's two goals against Newcastle in the FA Cup final. He also scored a vital away goal at the quarter-final of the Champions League, but was ruled out of the final victory over Bayern Munich through suspension.

===Established player===

Since then, Scholes has established himself as a world class midfield playmaker at the club level and for country. He became a key player in the Manchester United squad. Scholes generally played as a central attacking midfielder during his longstanding midfield partnership with Roy Keane, where Keane would drop deep and Scholes would push forward in a diamond formation. However since the departure of Keane he has shifted into a more conventional central midfielder, but still playing a more attacking role than defensive.

One of the well known features of Scholes' game is his high level of passing. Typical Manchester United moves over the last decade have involved Scholes receiving the ball from the holding midfielder, Roy Keane or Michael Carrick and then spreading a diagonal ball to the player on either flanks, mostly Gary Neville, David Beckham, Ryan Giggs or Cristiano Ronaldo.

Scholes' shooting has also been hailed by the fans and media alike. His goal-scoring record has diminished in recent seasons and it's highly unlikely he'll regain the goalscoring form he had during the 2002&ndash;03 season when he netted 20 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick away to Newcastle United and a 25 yard screamer off the underside of the bar against Everton.

In 14 years as a first team player at Manchester United, Scholes has won eight Premiership titles, three Intercontinental Cup, amongst many other personal achievements. As of April 30, 2008, he has scored 139 goals for Manchester United in his club career. No other Englishman has scored more goals in the Champions League than Scholes.

Unlike other modern footballers, Scholes does not have an agent and negotiates deals on his own behalf. He rarely gives interviews or accepts advertising contracts.

Real Madrid, which included Raúl, Roberto Carlos, Scholes was the most admired opponent, while Micah Richards called Scholes his "favourite player  of all time".<ref name="observer best"/>

Duncan Drasdo, head of the Manchester United Supporters' Trust, said, "As much as we love Cristiano Ronaldo, you don't get the same kind of connection as you do with Paul Scholes."<ref>{{cite news

===Later Days===
Scholes' retirement from England helped revive his club form in 2005–06 season with blurred vision. The cause of this was initially uncertain, at first leaving Scholes' career in the balance.<ref></ref> He overcame this problem through the beginning of the year and he appeared in United's final game of the 2005–06 season, against Charlton Athletic. Reportedly, Scholes' vision has not completely recovered.<ref></ref>

On Premiership victory over Liverpool at Old Trafford, twelve years after marking his Red Devils début with a League Cup brace against Port Vale, Scholes became the ninth United player to reach the 500th appearance landmark, following the likes of Sir Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes, Denis Irwin and current team-mates Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville. Scholes was voted Man of the Match and gave a rare interview after the game.

Inspired goalscoring form during late 2006 and early 2007 saw players from rival Premiership teams tip Scholes to be named Footballer of the Year. Arsenal, and Luis García of Liverpool, all said he was the player that they most admired. Many commentators have said that Scholes was their personal player of the year, over the high scoring Cristiano Ronaldo and Didier Drogba, although he eventually finished third behind these two, with Ronaldo claiming the top prize. He also made it into the PFA Team of the year alongside 7 of his fellow team-mates. In one edition of Match Of The Day Lee Dixon claimed that Scholes was the best footballer in the Premiership. 

Scholes was dismissed by referee Martin Atkinson, during Manchester United's 1-0 victory over Liverpool F.C. at Anfield on 3 March 2007, for swinging an arm at Xabi Alonso. It marked the first time he has been sent off in the league since Manchester United lost 1-0 to Everton FC in April 2005.  He missed the next three domestic games. The loss of Scholes was described by Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson as "a disappointment." <ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=199371&cc=4716 ESPNsoccernet - England - Liverpool v Man Utd Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  A month later he was sent off in the first leg of United's Champions League quarter final at A.S. Roma. On 13 May 2007, four seasons after Manchester United's last league championship, Scholes won his 7th Premiership title.

Scholes scored his first goal of the 2007/08 campaign in United's second game of the season away to Portsmouth. Following the 0-0 draw against Reading at Old Trafford, this was Manchester United's first goal of their extremely successful 2007-2008 season, ending in the European Double, consisting of the FA Premier League and the UEFA Champions League. On 23 August 2007, Scholes was shortlisted for a place in the National Football Museum Hall of Fame 2007. Viewers of BBC's Football Focus on 1 September 2007, however, ultimately voted for Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp.

In his autobiography, Sir Bobby Charlton says that he believes that Scholes is the one player still playing who truly epitomises the spirit of Manchester United and what is great about football.

Scholes was ruled out of action until the end of January 2008, after scan results showed he had suffered knee ligament damage. He sustained the injury after turning awkwardly in training the night before United's Champions League Group F clash with Dynamo Kiev on Tuesday 23 October 2007. Scholes made his long awaited return coming on as a Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the Liverpool and Aston Villa.

On Barcelona. In the 2nd leg, on Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson stated immediately that Scholes would start the final of the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final against Chelsea F.C., which United won on penalties after a 1-1 draw in normal time. Scholes himself received a blood injury, and yellow card, early on after a clash with Claude Makélélé, but returned to play a significant part in the match until his substitution for Ryan Giggs in the 87th minute. By winning the trophy, Scholes finally excorcised the demons of missing the 1999 Final through suspension.

Scholes is due to be inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in September 2008, alongside former team mate for United and England David Beckham.

==International career==

Scholes made his international début against South Africa in 1997 in a 2-1 friendly win at Old Trafford, and was included in the England squad for the 1998 World Cup. England were grouped with Colombia, Tunisia and Romania. During England's first World Cup group match against Tunisia, Scholes sealed a 2-0 victory with a goal late in the game. Picking up a pass from Paul Ince just outside the Tunisian area, Scholes pushed the ball slightly to his right and hit a shot with his right foot which curled into the top right-hand corner of Tunisian keeper Chokri El Ouaer's net.
