'''Graham James Arnold''' (born Australian national football (soccer) team. He was appointed to work as an assistant to Italy as a result of a controversial penalty. After Hiddink left, he became acting coach of the Socceroos.<ref></ref> He is a member of the Football Federation Australia Football Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Arnold was a striker who started his career at Canterbury-Marrickville in the New South Wales Premier League. He then moved to Sydney Croatia in Australia's now defunct NSL, where he was both the league's top goal scorer and player of the year in 1986. This was followed by a move overseas, where he made a name for himself in the Netherlands, playing for Roda JC and NAC Breda. He also spent time in Belgium with R.F.C. de Liège and R. Charleroi S.C.. He went on to play for Sanfrecce Hiroshima in Japan towards the end of his career, before finally returning home to play for the Northern Spirit FC.

===International===
Graham Arnold has represented Australia's senior national team 56 times, scoring 19 goals (85 caps, 33 goals including unofficial matches and "B" internationals). He was given his full debut by Frank Arok in a World Cup Qualifier against Taiwan at Adelaide's Hindmarsh Stadium on October 23, 1985. He scored on his debut as the "Socceroos" went on to record a 7-0 victory. His international playing career came to a sad end on November 29, 1997 in a World Cup Qualifier against Iran at the MCG when the score ended 2-2 and Australia was eliminated on the away goals rule after leading 2-0 for most of the match.

==Managerial Career==
Arnold had a cameo role as a coach very early on in his career. He was coach for 2 games whilst he was a player at 90 season. However, his proper coaching career started in 1998, when he was appointed player/manager of the Northern Spirit FC. He was the coach for 2 seasons, making the playoffs in their debut season. He was then appointed to the position of Australian assistant coach in 2000, becoming acting coach in July 2006, then appointed head coach in December 2006. 

On 6 September, 2006 Australia was defeated 2-0 in an Asian Cup qualifying game against lowly-ranked Kuwait.  The FFA confirmed Arnold would remain Head Coach through to the end of 2007 Asian Cup campaign.

Australia started their Asian Cup campaign poorly, drawing with Iraq in the 2007 Asian Cup. Following the match, Arnold told the assembled media (in reference to some of the team's higher profile members), "There's some players who seem like they don't want to be here. I'm extremely disappointed."

Arnold startete seine aktive Karriere bei Canterbury-Marrickville in der "New South Wales Premier League". Der Stürmer wechselte zu Sydney Croatia (heute Sydney United) in Australiens National Soccer League, wo er 1986 Torschützenkönig und zum Spieler des Jahres gewählt wurde. Er wechselte in die Niederlande, spielte für Roda JC Kerkrade und NAC Breda. In Belgien war er für RFC Lüttich und Sporting Charleroi aktiv. Seine Karriere wollte er bei Sanfrecce Hiroshima in Japan ausklingen lassen; nach seiner Rückkehr nach Australien spielte er aber noch für Northern Spirit FC (in einem Vorort von Sydney).

Graham Arnold spielte 56-mal für die Nationalmannschaft, wobei er 19 Tore erzielte. Sein erstes Spiel absolvierte er während der WM-Qualifikation gegen Taiwan in Adelaide am 23. Oktober 1985. In diesem Spiel - Endstand 7:0 für Australien - schoss er auch sein erstes Länderspieltor. Sein letzter Einsatz für die Socceroos am 29. November 1997 endete für ihn traurig: Im Qualifikationsspiel gegen den Iran schaffte Australien nur ein 2:2 und verpasste damit die Teilnahme an der WM 1998 in Frankreich.
