'''Réunion''' (French: ''Réunion'' or formally ''La Réunion''; previously ''Île Bourbon'') is an island located in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar, about 200&nbsp;km (130 miles) south west of Mauritius, the nearest island.

Administratively, Réunion is one of the overseas ''départements'' of overseas region) and an integral part of the Republic with the same status as those situated on the European mainland.

Réunion is an outermost region of the Saint-Denis René-Paul Victoria bought a bag of lychees at a market.<ref></ref><ref>Réunion is pictured on all Euro banknotes, on the backside at the bottom of each note, right of the Greek ΕΥΡΩ (EURO) next to the denomination.</ref>

== History ==
Arab sailors formerly called the island ''Adna Al Maghribain'' (“Western Island”). The Portuguese were the first Europeans to visit, finding it uninhabited in 1513, and naming it ''Santa Apollonia'', after Saint Apollonia.

The island was then occupied by France and administered from mutineers to the island from the royal house.

“Réunion” was the name given to the island in 1793 by a decree of the Convention with the fall of the National Guard in British navy led by Commodore the revolutions during that year meant that the island became “Réunion” once again.

From the 17th to the 19th centuries, French immigration supplemented by influxes of Africans, Chinese, Malays, and Indians gave the island its ethnic mix. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 cost the island its importance as a stopover on the East Indies trade route.

Réunion became a ''département d'outre-mer'' (overseas department) of code is 974.

Between 15 and 16 March 1952, Cilaos at the centre of Réunion received 1,869.9&nbsp;mm (73.6&nbsp;in) of rainfall. This is the greatest 24-hour precipitation total ever recorded on earth. The island also holds the record for most rainfall in 72 hours, 3,929 mm (154.7 in) at Commerson's Crater in March, 2007.

In 2005 and 2006 Réunion was hit by a crippling epidemic of chikungunya, a disease spread by mosquitoes. According to the BBC News, 255,000&nbsp;people on Réunion had contracted the disease as of 26 April 2006.<ref></ref> The disease also spread to Madagascar<ref></ref> and to mainland France through airline travel. The disease led to more than 200&nbsp;deaths on Réunion. The French government under Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin sent an emergency aid package worth 36&nbsp;million euros ($57.6M&nbsp;U.S. dollars) and deployed approximately five hundred French troops in an effort to eradicate mosquitoes. Chikungunya means "that which bends" in the Makonde language of the Tanzania/Mozambique border region where it was first identified. It can cause dehydration, extreme pain and high fevers and in some rare cases can be fatal.  There is no known cure.

==Politics==

Réunion sends five deputies to the French National Assembly and three senators to the French Senate.

== Arrondissements, cantons, and communes ==

Administratively, Réunion is divided into 4&nbsp;arrondissements, 24&nbsp;cantons, and 24&nbsp;communes<ref>[http://www.insee.fr/fr/nom_def_met/nomenclatures/cog/CarteD.asp?numreg=04&numdep=974#res Insee - Code Officiel Géographique<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. It is a French overseas ''département'' as well as a French region. The low number of communes, compared to French metropolitan departments of similar size and population, is unique; most Réunionnaises communes encompass several localities, sometimes separated by significant distances. Réunion is part of the Indian Ocean Commission.

Réunion contains most of the same ethnic populations as Indian, Chinese and ethnic French - but in different proportions. Creoles (a name given to those born on the island, of various ethnic origins), make up the vast majority of the population. Whites make up approximately one-quarter of the population, Indians make up 21%, and people of Chinese ancestry form most of the remainder. There are also some people of Vietnamese ancestry on the island, though they are very few in number.

While Gujarati, followed closely by Tamil people make up the majority of the Indo-Réunionnaise people, people of Hindi, Urdu and other origins form the remainder of the population.

Réunion is very similar in culture, ethnic makeup, language and traditions to Mauritius and Seychelles.
