'''''Beatles for Sale''''' is Lennon and McCartney as lyricists, Lennon particularly now showing interest in composing songs of a more autobiographical nature. "I'm a Loser" shows Lennon for the first time seemingly coming under the influence of Paul McCartney - Many Years From Now'' by Barry Miles)</ref>

In the United States, the tracks on ''Beatles for Sale'' were first released on the Capitol albums ''Beatles '65''  and ''Beatles VI''.

==Overview==

''Beatles for Sale'' is considered by some to be one of the weaker albums in the group's history, because of the "war weariness" (Lewisohn) the band was suffering from the now constant slog of touring and recording. Others note that the album, with its ironic title, and downbeat lyrics and cover photo, seems intended as a direct challenge to fans who wanted the Beatles to continue writing upbeat, happy songs. However, given the difference in singles release policy,(see below), this was less evident in the United States, where albums had fewer cuts and were spaced more closely in sequence. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic says ''Beatles for Sale'' brought folk and rock closer together on tracks such as I'm A Loser and I'll Follow The Sun.
==="War weariness"===
Only two months and eight days separate the last full band session for ''A Hard Day's Night'' (Tuesday 2 June) and the first for ''Beatles for Sale''. Prior to the new recording sessions, the band toured Australia and New Zealand (after a two-show night in Hong Kong), played concerts in the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden and made several television, radio and live concert appearances in the UK. It was "inevitable that the constant grind of touring, writing, promoting, and recording would grate on The Beatles" (Allmusic), leading to the inclusion of several cover versions after the all-original ''A Hard Day's Night''; the band's visible weariness on the album's cover is noted by narrator Malcolm McDowell during ''The Compleat Beatles''. Yet during these sessions they were still capable of recording the somewhat ironically-titled single "I Feel Fine" and its B-side, "She's a Woman" (both not in this album), both songs of considerable quality and interest. There is a strong country influence on songs like "I Don't Want to Spoil the Party" and "I'm a Loser". Gram Parsons has noted The Beatles strong country influence on "I Don't Want to Spoil the Party" noting that country rock was popularized in 1967.

===Charting===
''Beatles for Sale'' and its modified U.S. counterpart, ''Beatles '65'', each reached number one on the charts in their respective countries, with the former taking over from ''A Hard Day's Night'' in the United Kingdom. 

On 26 February 1987, ''Beatles for Sale'' was officially released on CD, as were three other of The Beatles' albums, ''Please Please Me'', ''With The Beatles'' and ''A Hard Day's Night''. Almost 23 years after its original release, the album charted in the United Kingdom for a fortnight in 1987. Having been available only as an import in the US in the past, the album was also issued domestically in the US on LP and cassette on July 21, 1987. Even though this album was recorded on four-track tape, the CD version as well as the US vinyl and cassette versions are available only in mono.

==Writing and recording==
===Background===
When ''Beatles for Sale'' was being recorded, Beatlemania was just past its peak; in early 1964, The Beatles had made waves with their television appearances in the United States, sparking unprecedented demand for their records. ''Beatles for Sale'' was The Beatles' fourth album in 21 months. Recording for the album began on August 11, just one month after the release of ''A Hard Day's Night'', following on the heels of several tours. Much of the production on the album was done on "off days" from performances in the UK, and most of the songwriting was done in the studio itself. 

Most of the album's recording sessions were completed in a three-week period beginning on September 29.  The Beatles' producer George Martin recalled: "They were rather war-weary during ''Beatles for Sale''. One must remember that they'd been battered like mad throughout '64, and much of '63. Success is a wonderful thing, but it is very, very tiring."

===Song selection===
Even the prolific Lennon/McCartney songwriting team could not keep up with the demand for their songs, and with a targeted deadline of Christmas to meet, the band resorted to recording several cover versions for the album. This had been their mode of operation for their first albums but had been abandoned for the all-original ''A Hard Day's Night''. The album included six covers, the same number as their first two albums. McCartney recalled: "Recording ''Beatles for Sale'' didn't take long.  Basically it was our stage show, with some new songs."  Indeed, three of the cover tunes were recorded in a total of five takes in one session on October 18.

''Beatles for Sale'' featured eight original Lennon and McCartney works. At this stage in their collaboration, Lennon's and McCartney's songwriting was highly collaborative; even when songs had a primary author the other would often contribute key parts, as with "No Reply" where McCartney provided a middle-eight for what was otherwise almost entirely a Lennon song. 

In 1994, McCartney described the songwriting process he and Lennon went through: <blockquote>We would normally be rung a couple of weeks before the recording session and they'd say, 'We're recording in a month's time and you've got a week off before the recordings to write some stuff.'  ...so I'd go out to John's every day for the week, and the rest of the time was just time off. We always wrote a song a day, whatever happened we always wrote a song a day.... Mostly it was me getting out of London, to John's rather nice, comfortable Weybridge house near the golf course.... So John and I would sit down, and by then it might be one or two o'clock, and by four or five o'clock we'd be done.</blockquote>

===Abbey Road Studios===
The recording of ''Beatles for Sale'' took place at four-track."  

Recording was completed on October 18. The band participated in several mixing and editing sessions before completing the project on November 4; the album was rushed into production and released exactly a month later. It was their fourth in 21 months. The Beatles' manager Neil Aspinall later reflected: "No band today would come off a long US tour at the end of September, go into the studio and start a new album, still writing songs, and then go on a UK tour, finish the album in five weeks, still touring, and have the album out in time for Christmas. But that's what the Beatles did at the end of 1964.  A lot of it was down to naivety, thinking that this was the way things were done.  If the record company needs another album, you go and make one."

==Original songs==
===Opening tracks===
The opening three tracks, "No Reply", "No Reply,' 'I'm a Loser', and 'Baby's in Black,'" according to Allmusic, "finds the singer showing up at a party only to find that the girl he expected to find isn't there."

==="No Reply"===

According to Lennon in 1972, The Beatles' music publisher Dick James was quite pleased with "No Reply": 

<blockquote>I remember Dick James coming up to me after we did this one and saying, 'You're getting better now &mdash; that was a complete story.' Apparently, before that, he thought my songs wandered off.
</blockquote> 

Reviewer David Rowley found its lyrics to "read like a picture story from a girl's comic," and to depict the picture "of walking down a street and seeing a girl silhouetted in a window, not answering the telephone."

==="I'm a Loser"===

Allmusic singled out "I'm a Loser" as "one of the very first The Beatles compositions with lyrics addressing more serious points than young love." (cf. There's a Place)

Rowley found it to be an "obvious copy of Bob Dylan," as where Lennon refers to the listener as a 'friend', Dylan does the same on "Blowin in the Wind". He also said its intention was to "openly subvert the simple true love themes of their earlier work."

==="Baby's in Black"===

Although "Baby's in Black", which Allmusic described as "a love lament for a grieving girl that was perhaps more morose than any previous The Beatles song," was, as described by some, as mostly Lennon's work, it was written in the same room with McCartney, who contributed a harmony to it.  Other therefore dispute that the song was mostly Lennon's work and claim that Lennon and McCartney were equally responsible for the song's composition; a claim that might be supported by the fact that both Lennon and McCartney shared lead vocal duties.

McCartney considered the ''Beatles for Sale'' sessions to be the beginning of a more mature phase for the band: 

<blockquote>We got more and more free to get into ourselves. Our student selves rather than 'we must please the girls and make money', which is all that "From Me to You", "Thank You Girl", "P. S. I Love You!" is about. "Baby's in Black" we did because we liked waltz-time ... and I think also John and I wanted to do something bluesy, a bit darker, more grown-up, rather than just straight pop.
</blockquote>

==="Every Little Thing"===

The dark theme of the album was balanced by "Every Little Thing," a "celebration of what a wonderful girl the guy has," according to Allmusic, that appeared later in the album and had been written as an attempt for a single, according to McCartney: 

<blockquote>'Every Little Thing', like most of the stuff I did, was my attempt at the next single ... but it became an album filler rather than the great almighty single. It didn't have quite what was required.</blockquote> 

The British progressive rock band Yes covered the song on their 1969 debut album.

==="Eight Days a Week"===

''Eight Days a Week'' is noteworthy as one of the first examples of the in-studio experimentation that the band would use extensively in the future; in two recording sessions totalling nearly seven hours on fade in as a counterpoint to pop songs which end in a fade out.

==="I'll Follow the Sun"===
