In Austria, the '''legislative election of October 3, 1999''' (elections for the National Council of Austria) caused a major upheaval in the political landscape.

From 1971, 1975, 1979 under the leadership of Bruno Kreisky. 

From 1983 to 1986, the SPÖ, under the leadership of Fred Sinowatz, headed a coalition government with the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), which was then led by Norbert Steger, a liberal; this coalition broke when the right-wing politician Jörg Haider became the leader of the FPÖ.

From 1986 to 1999 the government was formed by a coalition between SPÖ and its junior partner ÖVP (Austrian People's Party). During that time the share of Haider's FPÖ grew from 5% to 27%.

In the 1999 election campaign, Wolfgang Schüssel, leader of the ÖVP since 1995, announced that his party would not be part of next government if it should fall behind its current second place.  His promise did (as he had planned) mobilize his voters, but not enough -- by the slimmest of margins, Schüssel's ÖVP had to yield the second position to Haider's FPÖ (see table below).

The Liberal Forum  lost all its 10 seats in the National Council, where they had been represented since 1993, and has subsequently become a microparty.

Austrian federal president Thomas Klestil, in accordance with tradition and also with his own preferences, asked acting chancellor Viktor Klima, head of the SPÖ, which had remained the strongest party, to form a government that would have a majority in parliament; as an SPÖ-FPÖ coalition was unrealistic (because of the SPÖ's disdain for Haider's personality and politics), this would have meant a renewal of the SPÖ-ÖVP coalition.  Negotiations dragged on for months and eventually broke down in late January 2000.
