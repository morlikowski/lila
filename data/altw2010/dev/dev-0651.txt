The '''Serbian Renewal Movement''' (Serbian: Српски покрет обнове or ''Srpski pokret obnove'') is a monarchist political party in Serbia. It was founded in 1990.

In the late 1990s a dissident group abandoned the party and formed New Serbia. 

The party was part of Zajedno in 1996 and contested the Yugoslav federal elections and the local elections that caused an upheaval through the end of that year. In 1997, party leader Draskovic ran twice to be Serbian President but finished third in both elections with about a quarter of the vote. Its party won the third largest number of seats in that year's Serbian parliamentary elections.

In early 1999, the SPO joined the Yugoslav government, and Vuk Draskovic became a Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister. The SPO had a place in Serbia's Rambouillet delegation and held posts such as the Yugoslav Information Ministry to show a more pro-Western face to the world in the run-up to Nato's 1999 bombing campaign against the country. In the midst of the war, Draskovic and the SPO pulled out the government, calling on the government to surrender to Nato.

The SPO participated in the attempt to violently overthrow Milosevic through the rest of 1999 through street demonstrations, but Draskovic chose in the midst of them to break off his alliance with Zoran Djindjic. This caused the anti-Milosevic elements to suggest that he was working for Milosevic. Draskovic also discredited himself when he kissed Madeleine Albright's hand in late 1999.

In the revolutionary 2000 presidential and parliamentary elections in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in which Milosevic lost, the Serbian Renewal Movement overestimated its strength and ran independently, outside of the vast Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition. Vojislav Mihajlovic, grandson of Chetnik commander Draza Mihajlovic, was its presidential candidate. He was opposed by Vojislav Kostunica of DOS, Slobodan Milosevic of the ruling SPS and Tomislav Nikolic of the Serbian Radical Party. The SPO's vote collapsed, with its traditional voters drawn by Kostunica's conservative nationalism and by the fact that he was their best hope to remove Milosevic from power. 

There was talk before the 5 October coup d'etat of dissolving the Mirko Marjanovic government in Serbia and setting up a government with the Serbian Radical Party. Following the coup, the SPO participated in a so-called national unity government that served effectively under DOS "coordinator" Zoran Djindjic. In December 2000, after two months of DOS rule, Serbian parliamentary elections were held. The SPO, once the strongest opposition, failed to enter the parliament. 

The SPO was sidelined as Djindjic ran Serbia and dissolved Yugoslavia along with Javier Solana and Milo Djukanovic in 2003. This brought into existence a new country with a separatist president called Serbia-Montenegro.
