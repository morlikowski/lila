'''アラスカン・マラミュート'''は犬の品種の1つで、大型犬に分類される。

== 概要 ==
*アラスカ北西部の海岸地帯で暮らすマラミュート族のもと、船の曳航やそりの牽引を業としていた。
*ハスキー犬と比べると、全体的に丸みを帯びた容姿をしており、しっかりした骨格と筋肉質で強靭な身体を有する。やや小さめの立ち耳、巻き尾、茶色の目を持つ。成犬の体重は牝34キログラム前後、牡38キログラム前後になる。体高は牝58センチメートル前後、牡63センチメートル前後になる。被毛は硬い手触りのダブルコート。毛色は明るいグレーから黒までの色合いで白のマーキングがはいる。

== 特性 ==
*温厚で忠実な性格で、集団性に富み、家族思いであるため、子供や高齢者とも仲良くなれる。
*信頼関係が崩れたり、過度に甘やかしたりすると、飼い主よりも上に立とうとするので子犬の頃からのしっかりとしたしつけと信頼関係が重要。
*硬い体毛に覆われた強靭な肉体は、多少の事ではダメージとならない。自身が頑丈であるためか、若干乱暴な動き（障害物を無視して猛烈に走り、衝突する等）をすることもある。

*極寒に耐えうる分厚い毛を有するため夏の暑さに非常に弱い。
:日本の場合、北海道や本州東部の山間部など寒冷地での飼育には適しているが、熱帯・亜熱帯地帯や温暖湿潤気候地帯での飼育は夏季の猛暑を考慮すれば体調管理上好ましくない。
*長時間の激しい作業（そりの牽引による人や生活物資・生業資材などの運搬）に耐えられる頑丈な骨格・筋肉質の身体・体力・持久力をもつ。

The '''Alaskan Malamute''' is a large breed of domestic dog (''Canis lupus familiaris'') originally bred for use as an Alaskan sled dog and is often mistaken for a Siberian Husky. 

==Description==
===Appearance===

The AKC breed standard calls for a natural range of size, with a desired freighting weight of 75 to 85 pounds (34–39 kg) and a height of 23 to 25 inches (58–64 cm). Heavier individuals (90lbs and dogs smaller than 75 pounds are common—there is often a marked size difference between males and females. Weights upwards of 95 pounds or more are occasionally seen; these dogs are uncommon and are produced primarily by breeders who market a 'large Malamute.' These large sizes are not in accordance with the breed's history or show standards.

The coat is a dense double northern dog coat, somewhat harsher than that of the Siberian Husky. The usual colors are various shades of grey and white, sable and white, black and white, red and white, or pure white. Eyes are almond-shaped and are always brown; blue eyes are an indication of mixed breeding and will disqualify the dog in shows.  The physical build of the Malamute is compact with heavy bone. In this context 'compact' means that their height to length ratio is slightly longer than tall, unlike dogs like Great Danes which are longer and lankier in their ratios.

According to the American Kennel Club, the primary criterion for judging the Malamute in a show is its function to pull heavy freight as a sled dog; everything else is secondary.  As many an owner has found out, the pulling power of a Malamute is tremendous.

The malamute has a plume like tail that is well furred and hangs just over the back like a "plume". This is the written standard written in the breed book. Corkscrew tails can now be seen but is not the breed description . A corkscrew tail is what  you would  see in the Akita. The malamutes' tails, well-furred, aid in keeping them warm when they curl up in the snow . They wrap the tail around their nose and face which helps protect them against harsh weather like blowing snow.

Though superficially similar to wolves, there are several physical differences. When compared to a similarly sized wolf, the malamute's head is not as wide, shorter, and generally smaller. Their necks are generally the same size, though the malamute is bigger in the chest by a few inches. The malamute stands two inches shorter, is three inches shorter in the leg, and eight inches shorter in the body. The wolf's tail is longer and has no tendency to curl over its back as the malamute's can. The wolf's track is nearly twice the size of the dog's.<ref name="SAM"></ref>

===Temperament===
While a few Malamutes are still in use as sled dogs for personal travel, hauling freight, or helping move heavy objects, some are used for the recreational pursuit of sledding also known as mushing, also skijoring, bikejoring, and canicross. However, most Malamutes today are kept as family pets or show dogs. Although in 1994 Nancy Russell ran a team of Malamutes in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, completing 600 miles of the roughly 1,150 mile race before pulling her team, the Malamute is generally slower in long-distance dogsled racing against smaller and faster breeds and their working usefulness is limited to freighting or traveling over long distances at a far slower rate than that required for racing.  They can also help move heavy objects over shorter distances.  

The Malamute is one of the most "unaltered" of breeds, retaining its original form and function. Their affectionate nature does not make them useful as watch or guard dogs. If a dog owner cannot cope with a dog that will not comply with the owner's every command, a more compliant breed should be selected. This dog has a long genetic foundation of living in the wilderness with man surrounded by other domesticated animals of approximately the same size. 

There is reason to believe that Alaskan Malamutes cope poorly with smaller animals, including canines.<ref>[http://www.breederretriever.com/dog-breeds/90/alaskan-malamute.php Alaskan Malamute. About Alaskan Malamutes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, this has been difficult to document in detail beyond observational data. It is difficult to pinpoint why many Malamute owners have observed this behavior with smaller animals, though some might speculate this is due to the Malamute's uniquely divergent ancestry, at one point cross-breeding with wolves.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/21/science/21dog.html?ex=1400472000&en=6b49c839cde80d81&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND The New York Times > Science > Collie or Pug? Study Finds the Genetic Code<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> So while Malamutes are, as a general rule, particularly amiable around humans and children and in some instances friendly with smaller dogs, it is probably a good rule of thumb to be mindful of your Malamute around smaller animals until you have become acquainted with its behavior. 

Generally speaking, time and experience will show if a dog can be left unwatched with other household pets. In this respect, it is also important to understand that just because your Malamute is comfortable with your other pets, this does not mean it will be comfortable around other animals it encounters. And while Malamutes aren't normally thought of as territorial dogs, they may react unfavorably to unfamiliar house guests.<ref name=breedretriever>[http://www.breederretriever.com/dog-breeds/90/alaskan-malamute.php Alaskan Malamute. About Alaskan Malamutes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Like many canines, Malamutes may become aggressive around other unfamiliar dogs, especially if they are not neutered or spayed,neutering or spaying you malamute will help them settle down .<ref name=apbc>[http://www.apbc.org.uk/article4.htm Neutering Male Dogs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This is important to note due to their powerful, deep chest and large head.<ref>[http://www.akc.org/breeds/alaskan_malamute/index.cfm American Kennel Club - Alaskan Malamute<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Male dogs are of particular note, as they are generally the more aggressive sex, due to factors like testosterone acting on the brain, which is one of the major reasons veterinarians recommend neutering as a puppy.<ref name=apbc/> Overall, however, Malamutes are quite fond of people, a well known trait that makes them particularly sought-after family dogs. Malamutes are thought to be clumsy, but are nimble around furniture and smaller items, making them ideal house dogs. However, they prefer to be outdoors in winter to enjoy the snow. If they are year-round outdoor dogs, letting them play in a baby pool filled with cold water in summer keeps them cool, but air conditioning inside is a must have. They will stand in the baby pool at times, seemingly doing nothing at all. However, they absorb much of the coolness of the water through their paws,and giving them nice cool water with ice and putting them inside where the air coditioner is on the hottest part of the day helps too.
