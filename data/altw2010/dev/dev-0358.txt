'''''The Yakuza''''' is a 1975 post–film noir gangster film directed by Sydney Pollack, written by Leonard Schrader, Paul Schrader, and Robert Towne.

''The Yakuza'' portrays the clash of traditional Japanese values during Japan's transition from the US occupation to economic success in the early 1970s. The story's themes are concepts of moral indebtedness and obligation, loyalty to family and friends, and sacrifice; Eastern and Western cultural values are contrasted, and Classical Japanese tradition versus the modern, Westernized, tradition of contemporary Japan. 

Following a lacklustre initial release, the film gained a cult following.
==Plot==

Retired detective Harry Kilmer (Robert Mitchum) is called by an old friend, George Tanner (Brian Keith). Tanner has been doing business with a ''yakuza'' gangster, Tono, who has taken Tanner's daughter and her boyfriend hostage to apply pressure in a business deal. Tanner hopes that through Kilmer's Japanese contacts, he can locate and rescue the girl. 

Tanner and Kilmer had been Marine MPs and friends in Takakura Ken) returned from an island where he'd been stranded as an Imperial Japanese soldier. Both outraged that his sister was living with his former enemy, and deeply indebted to Kilmer for saving the lives of his (apparently) only remaining family, he disappeared into the yakuza criminal underground, and refused to see or speak to his sister. Kilmer repeatedly asked Eiko to marry him, but she consistently refused. Then and since, Eiko has been cautious to do nothing to offend her brother further. As a parting gift, Kilmer had bought Eiko the bar which she operates to this day, and they parted, neither of them falling in love or marrying since. 

Tanner hopes that Kilmer can contact Ken and use his connections to help him. Ken's debt to Kilmer, ''giri,'' is a lifelong debt that traditionally can never be repaid. Ken would, Tanner insists, do anything for Kilmer. Traveling to Tokyo, Kilmer visits Eiko at her coffeehouse; seeing her once again, it is clear Kilmer still loves her deeply and again proposes. Asked about Ken, Eiko says that Ken is no longer a yakuza, but Kilmer visits him at his Kendo school. Ken's animosity towards Kilmer is clear, but together they find and free the girl and her beau.  In so doing, Ken injures one of Tono's men and is discovered by one of the gangster's lieutenants, an inexcusable intrusion by Ken in yakuza affairs. Contracts on both Ken and Kilmer's lives are issued. Kilmer resists leaving until the danger to Ken can be resolved. Eiko suggests that he talk to Ken's brother, a high level legal counselor to the yakuza chiefs, whom Kilmer hadn't known about. Goro (James Shigeta) is unable to intercede due to his impartial role in yakuza society, but suggests that Ken can remove the death threat by killing Tono  ... or ''Kilmer can kill Tono.'' 

Guilt-ridden that once again he's interfered with Eiko's family, and endangered Ken, Kilmer stays in Tokyo. After a failed attempt on Kilmer's life, he learns that his old friend Tanner had taken out the contract on him. Despite appearances, Tanner and Tono are well-acquainted and successful business partners. During an attack on Ken and Kilmer in the house they are staying in, a stray bullet kills Eiko's daughter, Hanako. Both men are crushed by the tragedy.

Seeking advice again from Ken's brother, Goro advises them that they have no choice but to assassinate Tanner and Tono. This will embarrass the partners in the eyes of the yakuza, and clear Ken's honor. Goro discloses that he has a son who has joined Tono's clan, and asks that Ken spare him should he be caught in the battle. Goro then discloses a shocking family secret to Kilmer in private. Eiko is not Ken's sister but his wife, and Hanako their only daughter. Hearing this, Kilmer realizes the true meaning of Eiko and Ken's rift, and Ken's anguish at the death of Hanako, all brought about by his presence in their lives. 

Kilmer finds and kills Tanner, then joins Ken for a near-suicide attack on Tono's residence. During a tense, prolonged battle, in which Ken kills Tono in the traditional way with a ''hari-kiri,'' but his brother forbids it. Instead, Ken performs ''yubitsume'' (the ceremonial yakuza apology by cutting off one's little finger). After Ken excuses himself, Goro talks with Kilmer, and compliments him on his adherence to Japanese traditions, surprising for a ''gaijin.'' 

Before leaving Japan, a visibly troubled Kilmer visits Ken, and asks to speak to him formally. While Ken prepares tea, Kilmer quietly commits ''yubitsume,'' and when Ken enters the room, waits for him to be seated. Presenting his finger to Ken, he apologizes for "bringing great pain into your life, both in the past and in the present." He humbly asks that "if you can forgive me, then you can forgive Eiko." Accepting the apology, Ken professes that "no man has a greater friend than Kilmer-san," and Kilmer reciprocates. Parting at the airport, both men bow deeply to each other.

'''The Yakuza''' est un film dramatique de 1975, écrit par Leonard Schrader, Paul Schrader et Robert Towne et dirigé par Sydney Pollack.

'''The Yakuza''' dépeint le désarroi des valeurs japonaises traditionnelles durant la période de transition allant de l’occupation américaine au succès économique du début des années 70. L’histoire s'articule autour des concepts de l'endettement et l'engagement, de la fidélité à la famille et des amis, et du sacrifice. Les valeurs orientales et occidentales y sont contrastées, une opposition apparaît entre les valeurs traditionnelles japonaises, opposées au Japon occidentalisé et moderne.

Ce film est devenu culte, et a influencé des films contemporains tels que Black Rain (1989), Aniki, mon frère (2001), Kill Bill (2004), Into the Sun (2005) et Blade Runner (1982).
