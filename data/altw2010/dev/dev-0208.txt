'''Ras Al Khafji''' (رأس الخفجي) o più semplicemente '''Khafji''' (الخفجي) era la principale città della zona neutrale fra Kuwait e Arabia Saudita, fù solo quando l'Arabian Oil Company, di proprietà giapponese, scoprì dei giacimenti petroliferi sottomarini nelle vicinanze che la città divenne ufficialmente parte dell'Arabia Saudita. Con un'accordo Kuwait e Arabia Saudita stabilirono che entrambi i paesi avrebbero continuato ad avere diritti sulle risorse naturali presenti all'interno della zona neutrale; quando il contratto dell'Arabian Oil Company per l'esplorazione e l'estrazione in quest'area ebbe termine le operazioni di estrazione furono affidate a società per azioni che rappresentassero entrambi i paesi e si decise che la produzione venisse divisa in parti uguali.
