'''Christine Lavin''' (b. January 2, 1952) is a New York City-based singer, songwriter, and promoter of contemporary folk music.  She has recorded numerous solo albums, and has also recorded with other female folk artists under the name Four Bitchin' Babes.  She has also put together several compilation albums of contemporary folk artists, including ''On a Winter's Night''.

She is known for her sense of humor, which is expressed in both her music and her onstage performances. Many of her songs alternate between emotional reflections on romance and outright comedy. Two of her more famous songs include "Sensitive New Age Guys" and "Bald Headed Men".

In her youth, Lavin was a cheerleader in baton with the house lights turned off as she leaves the stage.

Lavin worked at Caffe Lena in Saratoga, New York until Dave Van Ronk convinced her to move to New York City and make a career as a singer-songwriter. She followed his advice and accepted his offer of guitar lessons. She has lived in the City ever since. 

Lavin was the original host of "Sunday Breakfast" on WFUV in New York City. 

Lavin was a founding member of the Four Bitchin' Babes when they were formed in 1990.
