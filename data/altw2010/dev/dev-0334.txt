'''Mercy Graves''' is the name of a DC Comics character. Like Harley Quinn, she was created in the ''DC animated universe'' and later crossed into the comics.

==DC animated universe==
=== ''Superman: The Animated Series'' ===
A tough young woman with a checkered past, Mercy serves as Lex Luthor's personal bodyguard and chauffeur. Originally the leader of a gang of girl thieves, Mercy once daringly swiped Luthor's briefcase from under the billionaire's nose. She did not get far before Luthor's men hunted her down. However, rather than take revenge, Luthor, impressed by her mixture of ruthlessness and street savvy, offered her a job. He took her in, cleaned her up, and made her his right-hand woman.

Though she usually relies on cool and sardonic wit as her first form of defense, Mercy is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, using a rough, street-form of kickboxing as her preferred form of attack. She is an expert with most forms of handheld weapons.

Mercy is loyal and respectful to Luthor, but never servile. She claims to be "the only one in Luthor's entire company who can get away with calling him Lex". In the ''Superman'' episode "Ghost in the Machine," Mercy teams up with Superman to find the missing Lex Luthor. Superman tries to convince Mercy that Luthor does not actually care for her; Mercy tries to prove him wrong. However, after a battle with Brainiac, Mercy is pinned under a pile of fallen machinery while the room caves in. Although Luthor could have saved her, he flees instead, leaving her to die. This is the only episode of ''Superman: The Animated Series'' to prominently feature the character.

=== ''Justice League'' ===
When Mercy reappears later in ''Justice League'' ("Tabula Rasa"), the nature of their relationship becomes more clear. Mercy has agreed to take over LexCorp while Luthor is in prison, and is hesitant to return it to him because she feels their former relationship was not an equal one. She also states that while as the CEO of LexCorp she brought the stock up 30% and removed certain departments in the science division finding them useless or in order to save money.  Luthor exacerbates the situation by verbally and physically abusing her. It is repeatedly implied that their relationship was not solely platonic. Mercy assists Luthor's escape from the Justice League. However, after his capture she hangs up on him during his single phone call when he requests help in obtaining a lawyer and doctors to treat his kryptonite cancer. 

=== ''Justice League Unlimited'' ===
In the ''House'' star, Lisa Edelstein

==''Superman: Doomsday''==
Mercy appears in ''Doomsday. Lex tells Mercy to make sure that all evidence of LexCorp's involvement never existed. When Doomsday and Superman kill each other in an epic battle, Lex loses his chance to be responsible for Superman's death, both directly and indirectly through Mercy's destruction of the evidence. Once Mercy informs him that there's no link back to LexCorp, he shoots her in the head to make sure absolutely nothing can be traced back to him.

==''The Batman''==
In the episode "The Batman'', Mercy appears again as Lex's right hand, only this time she appears to be of Robin. When Luthor betrayed Mercy, Batman and Robin defeated her.

==Live action==
=== ''Lois and Clark: The New adventures of Superman'' ===
A Mercy Graves like character only known as Dr. Toni Baines appears in the movie pilot episode of Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. She is Lex Luthor's assitant and presumed girlfriend. She helped Lex cover up his plans to destroy Space station prothesis and take over the space program. She took Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen hostage for snooping. After Clark Kent saved them, she was killed by a bomb in her helicopter in which she was trying to escape. It is assumed that Lex was the one who put the bomb in the vehicle.

==DC-animaatiouniversumi==

===Teräsmies===

Mercy Graves on erittäin taitava taistelulajeissa ja osaa käsitellä useita eri aseita. Hän oli ennen rikollinen ja johti omaa tyttöjengiään. Graves onnistui kerran nappaamaan Luthorin salkun aivan hänen nenän edestä, mutta jäi kiinni, kun Luthorin miehet nappasivat Gravesin kiinni. Luthor ei kuitenkaan kostanut hänelle vaan tarjoi Gravesille töitä hänen hengenvartijana ja kuljettajana.
