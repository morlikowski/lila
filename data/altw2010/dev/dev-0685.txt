=Denied requests=
Bots that have been denied for operations will be listed here for informational purposes for at least 7 days before being archived.  No other action is required for these bots.  Older requests can be found in the Archive.<!--ND-->

=Expired/withdrawn requests=
These requests have expired, as information required by the operator was not provided.  These bots are ''not'' authorized to run, but such lack of authorization does not follow from a finding as to merit.  A bot that, having been approved for testing, was not tested by an editor, or one for which the results of testing were not posted, for example, would appear here.  Bot requests should not be placed here if there is an active discussion ongoing above.  Operators whose requests have expired may reactivate their requests at anytime.   The following list shows recent requests (if any) that have expired, listed here for informational purposes for at least 7 days before being archived. Older requests can be found in the Archive.
