'''Gin Ichimaru''' ('''市丸 ギン''' ''Ichimaru Gin'') é um personagem do Bleach.

É uma pessoa cínica, sempre com um sorriso falso no rosto, parecendo uma raposa. Seu olhar demonstra calma e bondade, porém ele mostra muito bem sua verdadeira natureza, maligna e manipuladora. Adora brincar com as pessoas mais fracas, fazendo com que elas lutem entre si e com ele. É muito forte, tendo uma Shinigami.

==História==
Ichimaru Gin é um Shinigami, capitão 3° Divisão. Conheceu Matsumoto Rangiku fora da academia shinigami, virando grandes amigos, depois eles vão para a academia, dando a impressão de terem vivido um romance durante este tempo.

Gin era Fukutaicho do 5° Esquadrão sob o comando de Aizen Sousuke, e os dois rapidamente se afeiçoaram. Os dois criaram uma forte aliança em um objetivo: ganhar poderes de Hollows e ultrapassar o limite deles. Com esse propósito, Aizen fez experimentos com Hollows, o que sempre dava errado. Foi quando Aizen descobriu sobre o Hougyoku, que podia quebrar esse limite facilmente, feito por Urahara Kisuke, e eles rapidamente começaram a correr atrás desse objeto.

Gin acabou caindo como Taicho do 3° Esquadrão, o que era favorável, para que o Aizen Sousuke pudesse por em seu lugar Hinamori Momo, uma garota que o idolatrava. Eles acabaram arranjando mais um companheiro, Tousen Kaname, que os ajudou no objetivo dele, apenas pensando na justiça.

thumb|left|Gin's open eyes.
Gin's most distinguishing characteristic is his expression; with his slitted eyes and ever-present grin, his face looks like that of a fox. Ichigo derisively nicknames him "fox-face" in their first meeting because of this (in the English dub, he instead replies with a more generalized insult). He also has unusual silver hair, which has a purple tint to it in the hollows, and the other during a battle with 10th Division Captain Tōshirō Hitsugaya. His eyes are alternately portrayed as light green/blue,<ref>''Bleach'' manga, Volume 20 cover</ref> blood red,<ref>''Bleach'' anime; episode 48</ref> and yellow.<ref> As portrayed in ''Bleach: The Blade of Fate''</ref> By contrast, there are far more moments when he stops smiling, those usually being lesser degrees of annoyance, genuinely apologetic moments, or in deep thought of a sudden epiphany.

Gin's constant happy facade tends to have the opposite effect on those he meets, making them instantly distrust him. His use of sarcasm only further encourages this, especially in those who have known him for a long time. Rukia comments on how she felt like snakes were wrapping around her neck whenever Gin spoke, despite the fact that he was speaking to her brother at the time. Kyoto dialect, which is indirect and polite. His English dubbed voice is also formal and polite, but with a rather mocking and facetious undertone.

After betraying Soul Society, Gin switches his captain's attire for a similar but unmarked garment. He now wears a long, white robe over his normal Soul Reaper hakama. The hilt of his ''zanpakutō'' is visible sticking out from under the robe through the opening down to his waist. Later, Ichimaru is seen wearing a white hakama like the arrancar, instead of the black one he first appears in. Gin wears his robe open in a narrow 'V' down to his waist, closed to below the hips, then open again to the hem, which falls about mid-calf. His robe has long bell sleeves, into which he hides his hands like one does with kimono sleeves. The lining of the robe and edges or layers of the under-robe(s) appear to be black. From other examples, it is likely he is also wearing black tabi with white waraji. His ''zanpakutō'' is not visible with this outfit.

== History ==
Gin saved Rangiku Matsumoto from starvation when they were children, and the two have been good friends since then. Rangiku is the only person Gin seems to truly care about. Gin was considered a child prodigy since he graduated from the academy within a year and was assigned to a seated position in the 5th Division.<ref>''Bleach'' manga; Chapter -105, page 17</ref> Gin killed the 3rd seat of the division with ease, which aroused Aizen's interest in him.<ref>''Bleach'' manga; Chapter -105 page 18-19</ref> Before he became captain of the 3rd Division, he served under Captain Sōsuke Aizen as the lieutenant of 5th Division.<ref name"GinLieutenant">''Bleach'' manga; volume 15 tankōbon, page 176 (chapter -17, page 30)</ref> A lesser point is his constant talks with Byakuya Kuchiki, which Rukia believes he did specifically to unsettle her since she was afraid of him.

== Synopsis ==
Gin's first major appearance is at the gates leading into the Seireitei, following Jidanbō's defeat by Ichigo Kurosaki. He easily repels the two without killing them, simultaneously closing the gate which Jidanbō was holding open. The other captains question his failure to kill opponents whom he should have had no trouble killing, but a second intrusion by Ichigo's group, followed by the supposed death of Aizen, leaves them with bigger concerns. Aizen, having faked his death, has Gin deliberately cast suspicion on himself, thereby drawing attention away from Aizen's activities. After Aizen's plot is revealed and they retreat to Hueco Mundo, Gin bids Rangiku Matsumoto goodbye and apologizes to her, one of the rare moments in which he doesn't smile. 

In Hueco Mundo, Gin jokingly chides Aizen over his habit of playing around with his subordinates. When Ichigo's group breaks into Las Noches, he observes them, even altering the position of the halls when no one is around. When Ulquiorra Schiffer catches him in the act, Gin denies changing anything, saying that he wouldn't do that to "those kids" and that he does not like "sad stories". He later appears alongside Aizen and Tosen to help destroy Karakura Town.

== ''Shinsō'' ==
thumb|Gin uses Shinsō to attack from great distances.
Gin Ichimaru's ''shikai'' is triggered by the phrase ; in the anime, this was slightly changed to the declarative ''ikorosu''. In the English equivalents of the series, the phrase is inconsistent between uses, but mostly uses terms describing stabbing (slay, impale, pierce, etc) coupled with a direct object, i.e. "Slay them." Its first rendering in the Viz translation was "skewer that punk".

In its ''shikai'', Shinsō's blade glows white and extends at high speed to impale Gin's opponents. In addition to making it a deadly long-range weapon, the extending blade also carries tremendous force without affecting Gin, making it useful for dislodging heavy objects, as seen when Gin pushes both Ichigo Kurosaki and the giant Jidanbō out from under the Seireitei gate, despite the latter being firmly braced under it. Once extended, Gin can maintain the blade's length and swing Shinsō in wide arcs, attacking multiple targets quickly and simultaneously.
