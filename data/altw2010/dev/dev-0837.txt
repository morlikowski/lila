'''George Gray''' (born American former professional wrestler best known as '''One Man Gang''' and '''Akeem The African Dream'''.

==Career==
Gray started his career at the age of 17 in the Kentucky/Tennessee independent promotions (most notably "Macho Man" Randy Savage, and Savage's arch-nemesis (coincidentally at this time nicknamed "One Man Gang") Kevin Sullivan and Sir Oliver Humperdink. He was a member of Sullivan's Dungeon of Doom in World Championship Wrestling and had a brief run as United States Champion in 1995.

In the regional territories, he was a member of Skandor Akbar's "Devastation Inc." as well as working with Gary Hart in World Class Championship Wrestling. It was as a protégé of Akbar's in the Mid-South territory where Gray would get the name that would stick with him the rest of his career. Making his debut in the territory by interfering in matches and assaulting the babyface, Mid-South announcer Jim Ross would say about the then-unnamed assailant "He's a one-man gang!". The Gang would work on-and-off in Mid-South in between tours of Florida, Japan, and Texas. He worked in Texas All Star wrestling where he feuded with Big Bubba(Fred Ottman). 

It was on his last tour for Mid-South when the promotion renamed itself the Universal Wrestling Federation, with Gang one of its top heels, most notably feuding at the main-event level with UWF top babyface Hacksaw Jim Duggan. In late 1986, Gang won the UWF Heavyweight Championship in an angle where the champion "Dr. Death" Steve Williams. Gang, scheduled to face Gordy later on the card, was awarded the belt via forfeit. He would hold that title for 6 months, mostly facing Duggan, Williams, and Ted DiBiase. 

In May 1987, Gang began receiving inquiries from the World Wrestling Federation about coming up to wrestle for them. He promptly agreed to terms, but returned to the UWF in order to drop the title to Big Bubba Rogers, who was there from his normal place in the NWA due to the recent sale of the UWF to Jim Crockett. 

===World Wrestling Federation===
Gray made his debut in the WWF on Slick, in a match against Jesse Cortez. He spent much of his early WWF run defeating enhancement talent ("jobbers") in extremely short matches in order to build him up, most notably in a match where he Gourdbustered his opponent after the bell and then did the same to the referee, thus being (kayfabe) fined $10,000 for his actions. While the Gang often defeated jobbers and other lower card wrestlers with ease, he would often be on the end of defeat when main eventing against bigger stars such as "Superstar" Billy Graham being forced into retirement. One Man Gang participated in the first ever Survivor Series Royal Rumble at number 19 out of 20 participants, and was one of the last two men left in the ring, before being eliminated by Jim Duggan. One Man Gang participated in the World Title Tournament at WrestleMania IV, defeating Bam Bam Bigelow by count-out in the opening round. He drew a bye in the quarterfinals before being disqualified in the semifinals against eventual-tournament-winner "Macho Man" Randy Savage after Gang hit Savage with his manager's cane. Following his loss at WrestleMania, Gang was placed lower "on the card," feuding with Bam Bam Bigelow, Koko B. Ware, and Don Muraco. 

====Transforming into Akeem====
In September 1988, One Man Gang's manager, Slick, announced that Gang was actually 1988, featured a vignette with Gene Okerlund on-location in "deepest darkest part of Africa", where he found One Man Gang transforming himself into his new persona. Slick announced from that point on, Gang would be referred to by his new name, '''Akeem, the African Dream'''. This vignette received some criticism, as the Caucasian "Akeem" delivered a promo in which he spoke with an extremely stereotypical black accent and mockingly danced while an African ritual took place in the background. Ironically, this vignette was featured by WWE's website in February 2008 during its Black History Month celebration.

====The Twin Towers====
Akeem and the Big Boss Man captained a team that featured Ted DiBiase, the Red Rooster, and Haku to battle the Mega Powers' team at Survivor Series 1988. During the match Akeem along with teammate Big Bossman handcuffed Hulk Hogan to the ring post and were later disqualified.

The two formed a team called the Twin Towers. Though the Twin Towers never held the WWF Tag Team Titles, they were strongly involved in the storyline which would eventually cause Randy Savage to turn heel and challenge Hulk Hogan at 1989 Royal Rumble, Randy Savage was accidentally eliminated by teammate Hulk Hogan, allowing both Akeem and Bossman to double team Hogan and eliminate him. ''The Main Event'' show broadcast live on 1989 featured Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage vs. The Twin Towers. During the match, Savage's valet Elizabeth was injured after Savage was thrown through the ropes and knocked her to the ground. This led Hulk Hogan to abandon his partner and carry Elizabeth back to the locker room for medical help. Although Hogan later returned to the match to help Savage defeat Akeem and Bossman, Hogan's actions with Elizabeth caused Savage to attack him backstage, setting up the headline match for WrestleMania. The Twin Towers went on to face The Rockers at WrestleMania V and defeated them when Akeem pinned 747 Splash after a powerbomb from the Big Bossman.

====Post-Twin Tower period====

In early 1990, Big Bossman became upset with Slick always trying to take the credit for him (as well as refusing to be part of a payoff from Ted DiBiase), and turned on both his manager and his partner Akeem. He defeated Akeem at WrestleMania VI. Although Akeem remained in the WWF until October 1990, his loss to The Bossman at WrestleMania was his last high profile match in the company.

===World Championship Wrestling===
In early Kevin Sullivan shaved Gigante's head in a post-match sneak attack. He lost a Loser Leaves WCW match to Gigante and left WCW afterwards, but returned in 1995. He became a member of Sullivan's "Dungeon of Doom" and lasted only a few months, but did hold the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship one time. He defeated Kensuke Sasaki for the title and dropped it to Konnan on his way out.

During his time in WCW in 1992, Gray appeared in the movie ''Stay Tuned''.

===After WCW===
One Man Gang wrestled in a dark match against Flash Flanagan prior to the 1998 ''RAW Is WAR'' taping. However, he was not hired.  Also in 1998 One Man Gang briefly joined gimmick battle royal at WrestleMania X-Seven, again donning the One Man Gang costume.<ref></ref>

===Currently=== 
At this time, the Gang has lost a lot of weight and plans on losing even more following a heart attack in 2000.<ref name=oww/> He currently works as a prison guard at the Louisiana State Penitentiary.<ref name=oww/> Although Grey is no longer performing on a regular basis, he occasionally makes appearances on the independent wrestling circuit.

== Karriere ==
=== Anfänge ===
Gray begann seine Wrestlingkarriere bereits 1977 im relativ jungen Alter von 17 Jahren. Er trat in den unabhängigen Ligen in der Region um Storyline von ''Randy Savage'' besessen wurde. Eine interessante Notiz am Rande ist, das ''Ron Garvin'', der Savage den Vertrag durch ein Match abnahm, zu dieser Zeit ''One Man Gang'' genannt wurde.

=== Regionale Promotions / One Man Gang ===

Als er in die ''Mid South'' Region kam, machte man ihn zum Mitglied der Gruppierung ''Devastation Inc.'', welche von ''Skandor Akbar'' angeführt wurde. Sein Debüt gab er dort, als man ihn des Öfteren in laufende Matches eingreifen und den jeweiligen Face attackieren ließ. Kommentator war damals Jim Ross, welcher den hünenhaften Gray als '''One Man Gang''' bezeichnete. Diese Bezeichnung blieb haften und sollte Grays neuer Ringname werden. Er trat in der Folgezeit auch für ''World Class Championship Wrestling'' in Texas, sowie in Florida und sogar Japan an. 

Seine vorläufig letzten Auftritte in den regionalen Ligen machte er für die nun ''Universal Wrestling Federation'' heißende Mid South Region, wo er 1986 den ''UWF Heavyweight Titel'' erhielt. Er fehdete darum mit World Wrestling Federation und gab seinen Titel nach 6 Monaten in einem Kampf an Big Bubba Rogers ab.

=== World Wrestling Federation ===

Am 12. Mai 1987 gab Gray als ''One Man Gang'' sein Debüt bei der WWF. Er bekam ''Slick'' als Manager und verbrachte die erste Zeit damit, Jobber in Squash - Matches zu besiegen. Im Zuge der gesundheitlichen Probleme des Altstars Big Splash in den Ruhestand schickte. Daraufhin trat er bei der ersten Survivor Series 1987 als Mitglied des Teams um Andre the Giant gegen das von Hulk Hogan an, in welchem sich auch Grahams neuer Schützling ''Don Muraco'' befand. Beim folgenden ersten Royal Rumble 1988, war er der vorletzte Mann im Ring, bevor er von Jim Duggan herausgeworfen wurde.

==== Akeem/The Twin Towers ====

Im September 1988 veränderte man Grays Gimmick. Gray sollte laut Storyline nun plötzlich afrikanische Wurzeln haben und er nannte sich ab sofort '''Akeem the African Dream'''. Zudem bekam er nun mit The Big Boss Man einen Main Event kam. Bei der ''Survivor Series'' des Jahres unterlagen sie mit ihrem Team jedoch durch Disqualifikation. Obwohl das Team nie die ''World Tag Team Titel'' halten durfte, war es doch ein maßgeblicher Bestandteil der Storyline um die beginnende Fehde zwischen Hogan und Savage. 

Bei ''Wrestlemania 5'' besiegte das Team die als ''The Rockers'' antretenden Face wurde. Das ehemalige Team trat bei ''Wrestlemania 6'' gegeneinander an und Gray erlitt die Niederlage. Er blieb  noch bis Oktober 1990 in der WWF, trat aber nur noch in belangloseren Kämpfen an.

1991 kam Gray zur WCW, diesmal wieder als ''One Man Gang''. Er wurde nun von El Gigante. Das Ganze gipfelte in einem Match, in welchem der Verlierer die Organisation verlassen musste. Gray verlor und verließ WCW wieder. Doch 1995 kam er nochmals zurück und wurde Mitglied des Stables ''Dungeon of Doom''. Er konnte ''Kensuke Sasaki'' den damaligen ''United States Champion Titel'' abnehmen, verlor ihn aber wieder an Konnan. Danach verließ er die WCW endgültig.
