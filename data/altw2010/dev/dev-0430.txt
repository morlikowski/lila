The '''Princes' Islands''' (Turkish: ''Kızıl Adalar'' [Red Islands] or more commonly ''Adalar'' [Islands] as they are officially named; classical Greek: ''Prinkēpōn nēsoi'', '''', modern Greek: ''Prinkiponisia'', ''''), are a chain of nine Tavşanadası with an area of 0.004 km². The islands also constitute one of the districts of Istanbul Province.

During the summer months the Princes’ Islands are popular destinations for day trips from Istanbul. As there is no traffic on the Islands, the only transport being horse and cart, they are incredibly peaceful compared with the city of Istanbul. 
They are just a short ferry ride from both the Kabataş and Yenikapı) of Istanbul.  Most ferries call in turn at the four largest of the nine islands: Kınalıada, Burgazada, Heybeliada and finally Büyükada. Ferry services are provided by [http://www.ido.com.tr Istanbul Seabuses (İDO)], a firm operated by the municipality of Istanbul. In spring and autumn the islands are quieter and more pleasant, although the sea can be rough in late autumn and winter. 

During the Byzantine period, Ottoman sultans family were exiled there too, lending the islands their present name. They were taken by the Ottoman fleet during the siege of Constantinople in 1453. During the 19th century the islands became a popular resort for Istanbul's wealthy, and Victorian era cottages and houses are still preserved on the largest of the Princes' islands. 

The Princes' Islands have become more and more ethnically Turkish in character due to the influx of wealthy Turkish jetsetters, a process which began in the first days of the Turkish Republic when the British Yacht Club on Büyükada was appropriated as Anadolu Kulübü, for Turkish parliamentarians to enjoy Istanbul in the summer. However, the Greek, Armenian and Jewish communities still constitute a small part of the islands' population. The islands are an interesting anomaly because they allow us to have a rare and incomplete insight into a multicultural society in modern Turkey, possibly alike to the multicultural society that once existed during the Ottoman Empire in places such as nearby Istanbul/Constantinople

For many Turkish people the islands are fondly remembered as the home of famous short story writer Sait Faik Abasıyanık and football legend Lefter Küçükandonyadis.

==Büyükada==
Büyükada (Big Island - Prinkipos, ''Πρίγκιπος'' in Greek) is the largest of the nine islands consisting the Princes' Islands in the Marmara Sea, close to Istanbul.

As on the other islands, motorized vehicles – except service vehicles – are forbidden, so visitors explore the island by foot, bicycle, in horse-drawn carriages, or by riding donkeys. 

A convent on Büyükada was the place of exile for the Byzantine empresses Irene, Theophano, Zoe and Anna Dalassena. After his deportation from the Soviet Union in February 1929, Leon Trotsky also stayed for four years on Büyükada, his first station in exile. Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid was born in the island.

There are several historical buildings on Büyükada, such as the Ayia Yorgi Church and Monastery dating back to the 6th century, the Ayios Dimitrios Church, and the Hamidiye Mosque built by Abdul Hamid II. Büyükada consists of two peaks. The one nearest to the ''iskele'' (ferry landing), Hristos, is topped by the former Greek Orphanage, a huge wooden building now in decay. In the valley between the two hills sit the church and monastery of Ayios Nikolaos and a former fairground called Luna Park. Visitors can take the 'small tour' of the island by buggy, leading to this point, from where it is an easy climb to Ayia Yorgi, a tiny church with a cafe on the grounds serving wine, chips and sausage sandwiches, this being part of the "classic" Ayia Yorgi (St. George, in Greek Άγιος Γεώργιος) experience.

==Heybeliada==
Greek: ''Χάλκη'' ''Chalki'') is the second largest of the Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara. It is a neighbourhood in the Adalar district of İstanbul. The large Naval Cadet School overlooks the jetty to the left as you get off the ferry. There are two interesting pieces of architecture on the grounds of the school. One is Kamariotissa, the only remaining Byzantine church on the island, and more importantly the last church to be built before the conquest of Constantinople. The other is the grave of the second English Ambassador to be sent to Constantinople by Elizabeth I of England, Edward Barton, who chose to live on Heybeli to escape the bustle of the city. 

To the right of the jetty lies the town with its bars and cafes, a hotel that stays open all year round, and many lovely wooden houses. 

At the top of the central mountain is an 11th-century Greek Orthodox monastery, it housed the Halki seminary, the main Greek Orthodox seminary in Turkey and Theological Seminary of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The monastery attracts tourists from all over Greece and Turkey. 

To prevent the island from becoming polluted, the only motorized vehicles permitted on the island are service vehicles such as ambulances, fire trucks, police cars, and the like.  The only forms of transport are by foot, service transport. There is no airport; the only way of getting there is by boat.

The winter population of the island is around 3,000, but in the summer, the owners of the summer houses return and the population swells to a 10,000 people. The main attractions during the summer are small-scale open-air concerts sponsored by the local council, a swimming and fitness club next to the sea, and an annual Independence Day march, which is commemorated by a resident naval band touring the island.

==Burgazada==

Burgazada is the third largest of the Islands, a single hill 2 km across. Demetrius I of Macedon, one of the Diadochi (Successors) of Alexander the Great, built a fort here and named it after his father Antigonus I Monophthalmus. The island took this name, but today is generally known by the Turks simply as "Burgaz" (Turkish for "fort"). In 2003 Burgaz suffered a forest fire, losing 4 square kilometres of woodland.

Burgaz is a common setting and even a major theme for writer Sait Faik Abasıyanık, where he also resided. Today, his residence is kept as a museum. At his favourite restaurant in Kalpazankaya (the counterfeiter's rock) one will also find his bronze statue enjoying the view with a glass of rakı freshly filled everyday by the restaurant owners.

==Kınalıada==
Romanos IV Diogenes, after the Battle of Manzikert, 1071). This is one of the least forested islands, and the land has a reddish colour from the iron and copper that has been mined here.

Les '''îles des Princes''' (en turc : ''Kızıl Adalar'' - Îles Rouges - ou ''Adalar'' - Îles, leur nom officiel ; en grec classique : ''Πριγκήπων νήσοι'' - ''Prinkēpōn nēsoi'' ; en grec moderne : ''Πριγκηπονήσια'' - ''Prinkiponisia'') sont un groupe de neuf îles, situées au large d'Istanbul, en Turquie, dans la mer de Marmara. La plus grande est Büyükada (5,6 km²), suivie par Heybeliada (2,4 km²), Burgazada (1,5 km²), Kınalıada, l'île la plus proche d'Istanbul (1,3 km²). Les autres, Sedef Adası, Yassıada, Sivriada, Kaşıkadası et Tavşanadası ont une superficie comprise entre un demi-hectare et 16 hectares. 

Pendant la période byzantine, on y exilait les membres de la famille impériale et les aristocrates disgrâciés - pratique poursuivie par les Ottomans. Au , elles servent de lieu de villégiature aux riches familles d'Istanbul - on y trouve toujours aujourd'hui des villas de style victorien, notamment sur Büyükada. Les îles des Princes sont aujourd'hui une destination fréquentée par les touristes pour des excursions d'une journée au départ d'Istanbul. Elles sont réputées pour le calme qui y règne ; aucun véhicule à moteur n'y circule.
