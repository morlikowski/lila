'''Shareware''' is een vorm van software die zonder of met weinig restricties verspreid mag worden, maar waarvoor bij herhaald gebruik wel een vastgelegd bedrag betaald moet worden. Vergelijk dit met freeware, waarvan de distributie vaak aan voorwaarden verbonden is, maar die zonder te betalen gebruikt mag worden.

Deze methode (beschreven in de licentie) beschrijft in het algemeen:
*wie er rechten op distributie van de software hebben. Dit kan iedereen zijn, maar ook een selecte groep.
*dat gebruikers de software kunnen proberen in een proefperiode, voordat er tot betaling moet worden overgegaan.

Door software als shareware te verspreiden, verlaagt de producent vaak zijn kosten, omdat er bijvoorbeeld geen verpakking nodig is, en verspreiding kosteloos wordt afgehandeld door derden. 

De grens tussen shareware en traditionele jaren 1990 vager geworden, omdat aanbieders van die laatste categorie steeds vaker probeerversies van hun programma's gingen verspreiden via traditionele distributiekanalen voor shareware als downloadsites en bij computerbladen horende cd-roms en dvd-roms.

'''Shareware''' is a marketing method for computer software in which the software can be obtained by a user, often by downloading from the Internet or on magazine cover-disks free of charge to try out a program before buying the full version of that program. If the "tryout" program is already the full version, it is available for a short amount of time, or it does not have updates, help, and other extras that buying the added programs has. Shareware has also been known as "try before you buy". A shareware program is accompanied by a request for payment, and the software's distribution license often requires such a payment. 

==Definitions==
The term '''''shareware''''' refers to commercial software that is copyrighted, but which may be copied for others for the purpose of their trying it out with the understanding that they will pay for it if they continue to use it. In contrast, ''retail software'' is a term used for commercial software which may not be copied for others, and ''public domain'' software refers to software which is not protected by copyright and may be copied and used without payment. ''Freeware'' generally refers to software that is copyrighted, but for which the author solicits no payment, even if the user continues to use it.

==History==
In 1982, IBM PC called telecommunications program, he used the term ''freeware''. About the same time, Jim "Button" Knopf released Horizon'' titled ''Psychedelic Science'' originally broadcast 5 April, 1998, Bob Wallace said the idea for shareware came to him "to some extent as a result of my psychedelic experience."<ref>[http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=6540905926032767614 Horizon: Psychedelic science by Bill Eagles, video.google.ca (about 41 mins into video)]</ref>

In 1984, ''Softalk-PC'' magazine had a column, ''The Public Library'', about such software. ''Public domain'' is a misnomer for shareware, and ''Freeware'' was trademarked by Fluegelman and could not be legally used by others, and ''User-Supported Software'' was too cumbersome. So columnist Nelson Ford held a contest to come up with a better name.

The most popular name submitted was ''Shareware'', which was being used by Wallace. However, Wallace acknowledged that he got the term from an InfoWorld magazine column by that name in the 1970's, and that he considered the name to be generic, so its use became established over ''freeware'' and ''user-supported software''. <ref>[http://www.asp-shareware.org/users/history-of-shareware.asp "History of Shareware".

Fluegelman, Knopf, and Wallace clearly established shareware as a viable software marketing method. Via the shareware model, Button, Fluegelman and Wallace became millionaires.<ref>[http://www.erowid.org/culture/characters/wallace_bob/wallace_bob_timeline1.shtml Bob Wallace Timeline]</ref><ref>[http://www.ddj.com/184403976?pgno=2 Article about Jim "Button" Knopf], from Dr. Dobbs Journal</ref>

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, shareware software was widely distributed over bulletin board systems globally and on diskettes (and subsequently, CD-ROMs) by commercial shareware distributors who produced catalogs of up to thousands of public domain and shareware programs. One such distributor, ''Public Software Library'' (PSL), began an order-taking service for programmers who otherwise had no means of accepting credit card orders. 

As Internet usage grew, users turned to downloading shareware programs without paying long-distance charges or disk fees, spelling the end of bulletin board systems and shareware disk distributors. In addition to shareware libraries online, the authors of programs had their own sites where the public could learn about their programs and download the latest versions, and even pay for the software online.

The Internet also made it easier to locate niche software, as well as the best and most popular general software. During the early 2000s, and with the increasing popularity of Web 2.0, new ways to filter the software became available.  Major download sites began to rank titles based on quality, feedback, and downloads.  Popular software was sorted to the top of the list. Blogs and online forums further enabled individuals to spread news about titles they like.  With this pruning in place, consumers can more easily find quality shareware products while still preserving the ability to find obscure and niche software.

==Implementations==
Free/open source software and shareware are similar in that they can be obtained and used without monetary cost. Usually shareware differs from free/open source software in that requests of voluntary shareware fees are made, often within the program itself, and in that source code for shareware programs is generally not available in a form that would allow others to extend the program. Notwithstanding that tradition, some free/open source software authors ask for voluntary donations, although there is no requirement to do so. Free/open source software is usually compatible with the strict Association of Shareware Professionals shareware guidelines.

Sometimes, paying the fee and obtaining a password results in access to expanded features, documentation, or support. In some cases, unpaid use of the software is limited in time or in features &mdash; in which case the software is vernacularly called crippleware. Some shareware items require no payment; just an email address, so that the supplier can use this address for their own purposes.

Shareware is available on all major computer platforms including Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Unix.  Titles cover a very wide range of categories including: business, software development, education, home, multimedia, design, drivers, games, and utilities.

==Logistics==
With shareware, a developer bypasses the normal distribution channel eliminating the normal retail middleman markups and directly markets to the end user. The end result is a reduced end-user price compared to the retail channel. Users of shareware are encouraged to copy and distribute unregistered versions of the software to friends, coworkers and other acquaintances. The hope is that users will find the program useful or entertaining and will pay to register to be able to access all the features.

In the early to mid-1990s, large online distribution channels known as "portals", such as Download.com, Tucows, Yahoo! Games and RealArcade emerged years. These portals acted as media of distribution for the shareware developers, providing a much larger audience than before.

Many shareware developers are individual computer programmers who take a risk on a product &mdash; entrepreneurs.  Online shareware author communities, like the newsgroup alt.comp.shareware.authors, are often used by software seekers to post their novel software ideas for potential implementation.

===Distribution===
In the early 1990s, shareware distribution was a popular method of publishing games for smaller developers, including then-fledgling companies such as Apogee Software (now also operating under the brand 3D Realms), Epic Megagames (now Epic Games), and id Software. It gave consumers the chance to play the game before investing money in it, and gave them exposure that some products would be unable to get in the retail space.
