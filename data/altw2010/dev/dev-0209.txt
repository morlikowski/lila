'''It Would Be So Nice''' is a Richard Wright. It was released as the fourth single by the group.  The song was left out of the 1971 collection ''Relics'' and prior to the release of ''The Early Singles'' in 1992 with the box set Shine On, it was only available on the Masters of Rock compilation. Its b-side, "Julia Dream", was written by bassist Roger Waters and was also re-released on ''The Early Singles''.

According to a newspaper story published in 1968 there are two versions of the original single with slightly different lyrics.  The story goes that the first lyric had a passing reference to the British newspaper Evening Standard.  This was said to be banned by the BBC because of a strict no-advertising policy which did not allow the mention of any product by name.  The group was forced to spend additional time and expense to record a special version for the BBC which changed the lyric to "Daily Standard."  This version is the only one that has been re-issued on LP and CD.  It is unknown how many of the "Evening Standard" discs, if any, actually exist.  Despite the added publicity the single got very little airplay and failed to chart.

In ''The Dark Side of the Moon: The Making of the Pink Floyd Masterpiece'', John Harris writes about the song:
<blockquote>The first recorded work [Pink Floyd] released in the wake of Syd Barrett's exit was Rick Wright's almost unbearably whimsical 'It Would Be So Nice,' a single whose lightweight strain of pop-psychedelia--akin, perhaps, to the music of such faux-counterculturalists as the Hollies and the Monkees--rendered it a non-event that failed to trouble the British charts; as Roger Waters later recalled, 'No one ever heard it because it was such a lousy record.' Waters' own compositional efforts, however, were hardly more promising. 'Julia Dream', the single's B-side, crystallized much the same problem: though the band evidently wanted to maintain the Syd Barrett aesthetic, their attempts sounded hopelessly lightweight.</blockquote>

'''''It Would Be So Nice''''' est une chanson du groupe single en 1968, puis rééditée dans les compilations ''Masters of Rock'' et ''The Early Singles''. Sa face B, ''Julia Dream'', fut écrite par Roger Waters.

Le single original existe en deux versions légèrement différentes. Les paroles de la première version mentionnaient le journal britannique ''LP, puis en CD. Cet événement valut un peu de publicité au groupe, mais la chanson fut cependant largement ignorée.

Dans ''The Dark Side of the Moon: The Making of the Pink Floyd Masterpiece'', John Harris écrit sur cette chanson : « La première chose que Pink Floyd sortit après l'exclusion de Monkees) en firent un non-événement qui ne put marquer les charts britanniques. Comme Roger Waters s'en souvint par la suite, « personne ne l'a entendue parce que c'était une chanson vraiment nulle ». Les efforts de Waters en termes de composition n'était cependant guère plus prometteurs. ''Julia Dream'', la face B du single, cristallisait à peu près les mêmes problèmes : si le groupe voulait de toute évidence conserver l'esthétique barrettienne, leurs tentatives jouaient sans espoir dans la catégorie des poids légers ».
