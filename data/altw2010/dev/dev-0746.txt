'''Vought F-8 Crusader''' var ett amerikanskt hangarfartygsbaserat stridsflygplan.

F-8 Crusader flög första gången 1955 och 1 261 exemplar tillverkades. Planet användes i Vietnamkriget fram till 1972 då det ersattes av F-4 Phantom II. Det sista planet togs ur tjänst i maj 1976.

The '''F-8 Crusader''' (originally '''F8U''') was a single-engine Chance-Vought of USA. It replaced the Vought American fighter with Tillman 1990</ref> The '''RF-8''' Crusader was a Naval Reserve units continued to operate the RF-8 until 1987.

==Design and development==
In September 1952, Mach 1.2 at 30,000 ft (9,150 m) with a climb rate of 25,000 ft/min (127 m/s), and a landing speed of no more than 100 mph (160 km/h).<ref name="Goebel">Goebel 2006.</ref> Korean War experience had demonstrated that 0.50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns were no longer sufficient and as the result the new fighter was to carry a 20 mm (0.8 in) cannon. In response, the Vought team led by John Russell Clark created the '''V-383'''. Unusual for a fighter, the aircraft had a high-mounted wing which allowed for short and light landing gear. 

The most innovative aspect of the design was the FFARs, and cheek pylons for two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles.<ref name="Goebel"/> Vought also presented a tactical reconnaissance version of the aircraft called the '''V-382'''.  The F-8 Crusader would be the last U.S. fighter designed with guns as its primary weapon.<ref name="Tillman" /> 

Major competition came from Grumman with the F-11 Tiger, McDonnell with upgraded twin-engine F3H Demon (which would eventually become the F-4 Phantom II), and North American with their F-100 Super Sabre adopted for carrier use and dubbed the Super Fury.

In May 1953, the Vought design was declared a winner and in June, Vought received an order for three '''XF8U-1''' prototypes (after adoption of the unified designation system in September 1962, the F8U became the F-8). The first prototype flew on USS ''Forrestal''.

===Crusader III===
In parallel with the F8U-1s and -2s, the Crusader design team was also working on a larger aircraft with ever greater performance, internally designated as the '''V-401'''. Although the XF8U-3 Crusader III was externally similar to the Crusader and sharing with it such design elements as the variable incidence wing, the new fighter was significantly larger and shared few components.

==Operational history==

Prototype XF8U-1s were evaluated by VX-3 beginning in late 1956, with few problems noted. Weapons development was conducted at F-100, however, the world speed record of , set by the British Fairey Delta 2, on 10 March 1956, was not broken.<ref>[http://www.cloudnet.com/~djohnson/records.htm Records]</ref>

An early F8U-1 was modified as a photo-reconnaissance aircraft, becoming the first F8U-1P, subsequently the RF-8A equipped with cameras rather than guns and missiles.

===First fleet operators===
The first fleet squadron to fly the Crusader was USS ''Saratoga''. VF-32 renamed the squadron the "Swordsmen" in keeping with the Crusader theme. The Pacific Fleet received the first Crusaders at NAS Moffett Field in Northern California and the VF-154 "Grandslammers" (named in honor of the new 1,000 mph jets & subsequently renamed the "Black Knights") began their F-8 operations. Later in 1957 in San Diego VMF-122 accepted the first Marine Corps Crusaders.  

In 1962 the Defense Department standardized military aircraft designations generally along Air Force lines.  Consequently, the F8U became the F-8, with the original F8U-1 redesignated F-8A.

===Fleet service===
The Crusader became the ultimate "day fighter" operating off the aircraft carriers. At the time, U.S. Navy carrier air wings had gone through a series of day and night fighter aircraft due to rapid advances in engine and avionics. Some squadrons operated aircraft for very short periods before being equipped with a newer higher performance aircraft. The Crusader was the first post-Korean War aircraft to have a relatively long tenure with the fleet and like the USAF F-105, a contemporary design, might have stayed in service longer if not for the Vietnam war and resulting attrition from combat and operational losses. 

The unarmed photo Crusader was operated aboard carriers as a detachment (Det) from either VFP-62 or VFP-63 to provide photo reconnaissance capability. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, RF-8s flew extremely hazardous low-level photo reconnaissance missions over Cuba.

===Mishap rate===
thumb|Two Crusaders prepare to launch from [[USS Midway (CV-41)|USS ''Midway''; their variable-incidence wings are in the "up" position.]]
The Crusader was not an easy aircraft to fly, and often unforgiving in carrier landings where it suffered from yaw instability and the castoring nose wheel. Not surprisingly, the mishap rate was relatively high compared to its contemporaries, the A-4 Skyhawk and the F-4 Phantom II. However, the aircraft did possess some amazing capabilities, as proven when several hapless Crusader pilots took off from Da Nang with the wings folded. The Crusader was capable of flying in this state, though the pilot would be required to lose weight by ejecting stores and fuel, and then return to the carrier.<ref name="Tillman" />

===Vietnam service===
When conflict erupted in the skies over North Vietnam, it was U.S. Navy Crusaders that first tangled with MiGs. The Navy had evolved its "night fighter" role in the air wing to an all-weather interceptor, the Sparrow as their sole air-to-air weapons, and maneuverability was not emphasized in their design. Some experts believed that the era of the dogfight was over as air-to-air missiles would knock down adversaries well before they could get close enough to engage in dogfighting. As aerial combat ensued over North Vietnam from 1965 to 1968, it became apparent that the dogfight was not over and the F-8 Crusader and a community trained to prevail in air-to-air combat was a key ingredient to success. 

Despite the "last gunfighter" moniker, the F-8s achieved only four victories with their cannon — the remainder were accomplished with Colt Mark 12 cannons' feeding mechanism to jam under G-loading during high-speed dogfighting maneuvers.<ref>[http://www.faqs.org/docs/air/avcrus2.html [2.0&#93; Crusader In Action]</ref> Nonetheless, the Crusader would be credited with the best kill ratio of any American type in the MiG-17s and three were MiG-21s.<ref name="Grossnick"/>

USMC Crusaders flew only in the South, and U.S. Navy Crusaders flew only from the small ''Essex'' class carriers; there weren't many F-8s. USMC Crusaders also operated in CAS missions.

===Twilight service with U.S. Navy===

The last active duty Navy Crusader fighter variants were retired from USS ''Oriskany'' in 1976 after almost two decades of service, setting a first for a Navy fighter. The photo reconnaissance variant continued to serve for yet another 11 years with VFP-63 flying RF-8Gs up to 1982 and the Naval Reserve flying their RF-8s in two squadrons [VFP-206 and VFP-306] until disestablishment of VFP-306 in 1984 and VFP-206 on 29 March 1987 when the last operational Crusader was turned over to the National Air and Space Museum.<ref>[http://home.att.net/~jbaugher1/f8_18.html F8 Crusader]</ref>

The F-8 Crusader is the only aircraft to have used the AIM-9C which is a radar guided Sidewinder. When the Crusader retired, these missiles where converted to the AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radiation missiles used by United States attack helicopters to knock out enemy radars.

===NASA===
Several modified F-8s were used by digital fly-by-wire and supercritical wings.

===French Navy===

The F-8E(FN) was the last Crusader produced and 42 were ordered by the ''Clemenceau'' and ''Foch''. The Phantom II turned out to be too large for the small French carriers, and the Crusader was chosen.  An evaluation campaign was then performed aboard the Clemenceau on 16 March 1962 by two VF-32 F-8s from the carrier USS Saratoga.
