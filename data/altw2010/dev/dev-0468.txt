La fama di Havens iniziò nella scena folk del Greenwich Village, lo stesso contesto in cui emersero musicalmente artisti come Joan Baez e Bob Dylan. Nel 1969, Havens fu il primo artista a salire sul palco del Festival di Woodstock. Fu accolto con applausi scroscianti e continuò a suonare bis fino a esaurire tutto il proprio repertorio. Alla fine, decise di improvvisare una versione del brano ''Motherless Child'' con l'aggiunta della parola "freedom" ("libertà") ripetuta ''ad infinitum''. Questo brano diventò un successo internazionale.

Nel 1993 suonò al concerto in onore del presidente Bill Clinton.

Havens scrisse relativamente poche canzoni, registrando soprattutto ''cover'' di brani di Dylan e dei Beatles. 

In una intervista pubblicata su "album degli Yes è una ''cover'' (piuttosto elaborata, e con tanto di accompagnamento d'orchestra sinfonica) di ''No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed'' di Havens.
