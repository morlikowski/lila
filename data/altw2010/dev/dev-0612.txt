'''Russ Abbot''' (born '''Russell A. Roberts''' English musician, comedian, and actor.

== Career ==
He was the fifth of six sons born to Donald Roberts, who was English, and Elizabeth Laing, who was Scottish.

As a drummer Abbot founded the Black Abbots, who signed their first recording contract in 1977. Later on he appeared as a comedian, winning five times the award as ''Funniest Man On Television''.

From 1980, Abbot released some solo artist, and played successfully in several TV series.

''The Russ Abbot Show'' showed his talents as an all round entertainer and attracted millions of viewers. This show was very popular amongst younger viewers, prompting two annuals to be published in 1982 and 1983. The annuals featured comic strips based on popular characters plus some publicity photos of Abbot in a variety of guises, including, most famously, his James Bond satire featuring characters named Basildon Bond and Miss Funnyfanny, based on the fictional MI6 spy duo James Bond and Miss Moneypenny.  

After many years, Abbot bought the performing rights to his hit ''Atmosphere'', and refuses to allow it to be played on novelty hit (it spent two months in the UK Top 20 in 1984).

He married Patricia Simpson in 1967 and has four children: Erika, Richard, Gary and Christopher. He also has two grandchildren called Laing (1995) and Charlotte (2004). 

In 2003 his 'See You Jimmy' character (called C. U. Jimmy) came third in The Glasgow Herald's poll to find The Most Scottish Person In The World.

Abbot's theatre roles include Alfred P. Doolittle in ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'' at the London Palladium and also as Fagin in Oliver!
From July 2007 he took over the role of Mel Brook's The Producers. During December 2007 and January 2008, Abbot appeared as the Tin Man in the stage production of the Wizard of Oz at the Mayflower in Southampton.

'''Russ Abbot''' (eigentlich '''Russell Roberts''', * britischer Musiker, Komiker und Schauspieler.

Als Schlagzeuger gründete Abbot die Black Abbots, die 1977 ihren ersten Plattenvertrag unterzeichneten. Später trat er als Komiker in Erscheinung und gewann fünfmal den Fernsehpreis ''Funniest Man On Television''.

Ab 1980 brachte Abbot einige Alben als Solokünstler heraus. Darüber hinaus spielte er in zahlreichen Fernsehserienproduktionen und erhielt bald seine eigene ''Russ Abbot Show'', die ein Millionenpublikum anzog.

Vor einigen Jahren kaufte Abbot die Aufführungsrechte für seinen Hit ''„Atmosphere“'' zurück und verweigert jegliche Einwilligung, dass er im Radio gespielt werde; er meint, ''„Atmosphere“'' repräsentiere nicht seine wahren Fähigkeiten.
