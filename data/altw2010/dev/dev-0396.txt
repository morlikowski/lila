'''Ian Lancaster Fleming''' (British author, Second World War Navy Commander. Fleming is best remembered for creating the character of James Bond and chronicling his adventures in twelve novels and nine short stories. Additionally, Fleming wrote the children's story ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'' and two non-fiction books.

==Early life==
Ian Fleming was born in Robert Fleming, who founded the Scottish American Investment Trust and merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co. (since 2000 part of JP Morgan Chase). He was cousin to actor Christopher Lee and actress Dame Celia Johnson was his sister-in-law (wife of his brother Peter), and Great-uncle to the composer Alan Fleming-Baird.<ref>Henry A. Zelger, ''Ian Fleming: The Spy Who Came in with the Gold'' (New York: Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1965)</ref> 

Fleming was educated at Sunningdale School in Berkshire, Eton College, and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He was Victor Ludorum at Eton two years running, something that had been achieved only once before him. He found Sandhurst to be uncongenial, and after an early departure from there, his mother sent him to study languages on the continent. He first went to a small private establishment in Kitzbühel, Austria, run by the Adlerian disciples Ernan Forbes Dennis and his American wife, the novelist Phyllis Bottome, to improve his German and prepare him for the Foreign Office exams, then to Munich University, and, finally, to the University of Geneva to improve his French. He was unsuccessful in his application to join the Foreign Office, and subsequently worked as a sub-editor and journalist for the Reuters news service, including time in 1933 in Moscow, and then as a stockbroker with Rowe and Pitman, in Bishopsgate. He was a member of Boodle's, the gentleman's club in St. James's Street, from 1944 until his death in 1964.<ref>Eleanor and Dennis Pelrine, ''Ian Fleming: Man with the Golden Pen'' (Toronto: Swan Publishing, 1966)</ref> 

His marriage in Jamaica in 1952 to Anne Charteris, daughter of Lord Wemyss and former wife of Viscount Rothermere, was witnessed by his friend, playwright Noel Coward.

==World War II==
In 1939, on the eve of Naval Intelligence of the Royal Navy, recruited Fleming (then a reserve subaltern in the Black Watch) as his personal assistant. He was commissioned first as a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve lieutenant,  and subsequently promoted to Lieutenant Commander, then Commander.  His known codename was 17F.<ref>Richard Gant, ''Ian Fleming: Man with the Golden Pen'' (London: Mayflower-Dell, 1966)</ref>

In 1940 Fleming and Godfrey contacted ''Naval Intelligence Division Geographical Handbook Series'' produced between 1941 and 1946.<ref>[http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/27/2/153.pdf Progress in Human Geography - Sign In Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
 
He also conceived of a plan to use British occultist Aleister Crowley to trick Rudolf Hess into attempting to contact a fake cell of anti-Churchill Englishmen in Britain, but this plan was not used because Rudolf Hess had flown to Scotland in an attempt to broker peace behind Hitler's back. Anthony Masters's book ''The Man Who Was M: The Life of Charles Henry Maxwell Knight'' asserts Fleming conceived the plan that lured Hess into flying to Scotland, in May 1941, to negotiate Anglo–German peace with Churchill, and resulted in Hess's capture: this claim has no other source.<ref>Ivar Bryce. ''You Only Live Once'' (London: Weldenfeld and Nicolson, 1975)</ref> 

Fleming also formulated Operation Goldeneye, a plan to maintain communication with Gibraltar as well as a plan of defence in the unlikely event that Spain joined the Axis Powers and, together with Germany, invaded the Mediterranean colony.

In 1942, Fleming formed an Auxiliary Unit known as 30AU or 30 Assault Unit that he nicknamed his own "Red Indians"; it was specifically trained in lock-picking, safe-cracking, forms of unarmed combat, and other techniques and skills for collecting intelligence. He meticulously planned all their raids, alongside Patrick Dalzel-Job (one of the Inspirations for James Bond), going so far as to memorize aerial photographs so that their missions could be planned in detail; because of their successes in Sicily and Italy, 30AU (based at the [http://www.themarine.co.uk The Marine Hotel] Littlehampton, West Sussex, now a public house and venue for the annual reunion of the 30AU veterans) was greatly enlarged and Fleming's direct control was increased before D-Day.<ref> John Pearson, ''The Life of Ian Fleming'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 1966)</ref> 

Fleming even visited 30AU in the field during and after Operation Overlord, especially after the Cherbourg attack, in which he felt that the unit had been incorrectly used as a frontline force rather than as an intelligence gathering unit, and from then on tactics were revised.<ref>Bruce A. Rosenberg and Ann Harleman Stewart, ''Ian Fleming'' (Boston: Twayne, 1989)</ref>

==Writing career==
As the DNI's personal assistant, Fleming's intelligence work provided the background for his spy novels. In 1953, he published his first novel, ''Casino Royale''. In it he introduced secret agent James Bond, also famously known by his code number, 007. Legend has it that Camp X included Fleming, though there is evidence against this claim.<ref name="Book"></ref> The character of James Bond was supposedly based on Camp X's Sir William Stephenson and what Fleming learned from him.<ref>'' '''Inside ''Camp'' X ''' '' by Lynn Philip Hodgson, with a foreword by Secret Agent '''Andy Durovecz''' (2003) - ISBN 0-9687062-0-7</ref> two men have supplied the basis for Bond's character: naval officer Patrick Dalzel-Job, and Fleming's brother, Peter.<ref>{{cite serial

Initially Fleming's Bond novels were not bestsellers in America, but when President Casino Royale'' (1953), ''Live and Let Die'' (1954), ''Moonraker'' (1955), ''Diamonds Are Forever'' (1956), ''From Russia with Love'' (1957), ''Dr. No'' (1958), ''Goldfinger'' (1959), ''For Your Eyes Only'' (1960), ''Thunderball'' (1961), ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (1962), ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' (1963), ''You Only Live Twice'' (1964), ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' (1965), and ''Octopussy and The Living Daylights'' (1966).

In the late 1950s, the financial success of Fleming's James Bond series allowed him to retire to Goldeneye, his estate in Oracabessa, or "Golden head". There is also a Spanish tomb on the property with a bit of carving that looks like an eye on one side. It is likely that most or all of these factors played a part in Fleming's naming his Jamaican home. In Ian Fleming's interview published in ''Playboy'' in December 1964, he states, "I had happened to be reading ''Reflections in a Golden Eye'' by Carson McCullers, and I'd been involved in an operation called Goldeneye during the war: the defense of Gibraltar, supposing that the Spaniards had decided to attack it; and I was deeply involved in the planning of countermeasures which would have been taken in that event. Anyway, I called my place Goldeneye." The estate, next door to that of Fleming's friend and rival Noel Coward, is now the centerpiece of an exclusive resort by the same name.

Besides writing twelve short stories featuring James Bond, Fleming also wrote the children's novel ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang''.  He also wrote a guide to some of the world's most famous cities in ''Thrilling Cities'' and a study of ''The Diamond Smugglers''.

In 1961, he sold the film rights to his already published as well as future James Bond novels and short stories to Albert R. "Cubby" Broccoli, co-produced the film version of ''Dr. No'' (1962). For the cast, Fleming suggested friend and neighbour The Man with the Golden Gun''. 

Neither Saltzman nor Broccoli expected ''Dr. No'' to be much of a success, but it was an instant sensation and sparked a spy craze through the rest of the 1960s.  

The successful ''Dr. No'' was followed by ''From Russia with Love'' (1963), the second and last James Bond movie Ian Fleming saw.  

During the Greek and some Turkish scholars attributed to secret orchestrations by Britain, Fleming wrote an account of the events, "The Great Riot of Istanbul", which was published in the ''The Sunday Times'' on 11 September 1955.

==Later life==

Fleming was a Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, U.S.A.

In March 1960, Fleming met John F. Kennedy through Marion Oates Leiter who was a mutual friend and invited both to dinner.  Leiter had introduced Kennedy to Fleming's books during his recovery from an operation in 1955. After dinner Fleming related his ideas on discrediting Fidel Castro; these were reported to Central Intelligence Agency chief Allen Welsh Dulles, who gave the ideas serious consideration.<ref>Chancellor, Henry ''James Bond the Man and His World (2005)</ref> 

Fifty-six-year-old Ian Fleming died of a heart attack on the morning of Sevenhampton village, near Swindon. Upon their own deaths, Fleming's widow, Ann Geraldine Mary Fleming (1913–1981), and son Caspar Robert Fleming (1952–1975), were buried next to him. Caspar committed suicide with a drug overdose.

'''イアン・フレミング'''（Ian Lancaster Fleming、1908年5月28日 - 1964年8月12日）は、イギリス・ロンドン生まれの冒険小説家。

国会議員の家庭に生まれ、ロイター通信の支局長（外信部長）としてゴールデンアイ」に居住。1953年に、それまでの経験をもとに「ジェームズ・ボンド」シリーズ第1作となる長編『カジノ・ロワイヤル』を発表する。1964年に遺作となった『黄金の銃をもつ男』を校正中に心臓麻痺で死去（56才）。

映画からは窺えないが、著作（007シリーズ）内の食事シーンが実に克明に描かれており、フレミング本人も「超美食家」ともいうべき生活習慣のスタイルであったと伝えられている。そのために、早い段階から心臓血管の疾患をかかえて生活しており、映画化された自分の作品は、映画における第3作目の『ロシアより愛をこめて』までしか目にすることができなかった。

妻はアン・ロザーメア伯爵夫人（旧姓ジェラルディーン、- 1981）。息子はカスパー (- 1975)。従兄弟には『吸血鬼ドラキュラ』などに出演した俳優のクリストファー・リーがいる（彼は、映画『007 黄金銃を持つ男』で敵役であるスカラマンガを演じた）。また、『チャーリーとチョコレート工場』などの同じくイギリスの作家ロアルド・ダールと親交があり、ダールは『007は二度死ぬ』映画版の脚本をつとめている。

1990年にイアン・フレミングを題材にした映画『スパイメーカー』が公開された。監督はフェルディナンド・フェアファックス、主演はジェイソン・コネリー（ショーン・コネリーの息子）。
