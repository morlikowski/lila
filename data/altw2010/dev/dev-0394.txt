Colombia's violation of Ecuadorian sovereignty, which was rejected as illegal by Ecuador and multiple countries throughout the region as well as by other analysts<ref name="EscobarMay22"/><ref name="LendmanMay19"/>, led to increased tensions between Colombia and Ecuador, as well as the movement of Venezuelan and Ecuadorian troops to their respective borders. The crisis ended at a Rio Group summit on 7 March 2008, with a public reconciliation of the parties involved in the dispute.<ref>Juan Feraro, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/03/07/ST2008030703581.html "Latin American Crisis Resolved"], ''Washington Post'', March 8, 2008.</ref>

==Background==

In 2007, Venezuelan President Colombian Senator Humanitarian Exchange between the FARC and the government of Colombia. Colombian President Álvaro Uribe gave permission for Chávez to mediate under the conditions that all meetings with the FARC would take place only in Venezuela and that Chávez would not directly contact members of the Colombian military, but instead would go through the proper diplomatic channels.<ref> </ref><ref>
 </ref> President Uribe abruptly terminated Chávez's mediation on November 22, 2007 after Chávez personally contacted General Mario Montoya Uribe (not to be confused with president Alvaro Uribe), the Commander of the Colombian National Army.<ref> </ref> In response Chávez said he would be willing to mediate again but that he had withdrawn Venezuela's ambassador to Colombia and that he had placed Colombian-Venezuelan relations "in a freezer". He also called Uribe a "liar and a cynic".<ref> </ref> 
Uribe responded that Colombia needed "mediation against terrorism, not for Chávez to legitimize terrorism", that Chávez was not interested in peace in Colombia, and that Chávez was building an expansionist project on the continent.<ref>
 </ref> From January to February 2008, FARC unilaterally released six hostages "as a gesture of goodwill" toward Chávez, who brokered the deal and picked them up by sending Venezuelan helicopters with Red Cross logos into Colombian jungles.<ref>

==Diplomatic developments==
Colombia's violation of Ecuadorian sovereignty led to increased tensions between Colombia and most of the other South American states.

On Saturday, March 1, Álvaro Uribe said a few hours after the operation that "today we have taken another step against terrorism, that does not respect borders" and added that he took full responsibility for the operation.<ref> </ref>
Uribe also spoke by telephone with his Ecuadorian counterpart, Rafael Correa, before 8:30 am, to inform him of the incident.<ref name="BBC Mundo 48 horas"></ref>

In a press conference that evening, Correa rejected the incident as an "aggression" against Ecuador, considered the result to be a "massacre" after describing that the rebels had been killed in their sleep using "advanced technology", and said he was summoning his ambassador in Colombia for consultations.<ref name="BBC Mundo 48 horas" />

Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez called the attack "a cowardly murder" and reacted by closing his country's embassy in Colombia and moving troops near the border with Colombia.<ref name = "Chavez-laments"></ref>

On Sunday, March 2, Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa announced that a diplomatic note would be sent in protest,<ref></ref> saying that the action was a violation of Ecuador's airspace.<ref name="IHT 20080302"></ref>  Ecuador also formally recalled its ambassador from Colombia, and expelled the Colombian ambassador in Quito.<ref name="BBC Mundo 48 horas" />

The Colombian government announced it would not mobilize any troops in response to Hugo Chávez's order to move 10 battalions towards the frontier and that it will not respond to the accusations made by Chávez on his weekly TV program ''Aló Presidente'', who denounced the President Uribe as a "liar", "a lackey of North-American Imperialism" and claimed Colombia sought to become "the Latin American equivalent of Israel", linking Colombia's actions with his criticism of Israel Defense Forces' strikes on Palestinian militants.<ref></ref>

Colombian foreign minister Fernando Araújo Perdomo apologized to Ecuador, "for the action that we were forced to take in the border zone". He added that "the Colombian government never had the intention or disposition to be disrespectful of or to violate the sovereignty or integrity of the sister republic of Ecuador".<ref></ref>

The Colombian foreign ministry affirmed that Raúl Reyes "directed for many years criminal operations in the southern part of our country, covertly, from Ecuadorian territory, without the approval of that government". The Colombian government said it was ready "to compensate any Ecuadorian citizens that could have been affected".<ref></ref>

That same day, Ecuador's Foreign Ministry issued a statement alluding to its cutting off diplomatic ties with the government of Colombia. The statement reported that president Correa had initially ordered the protection of a Colombian patrol which claimed to be surrounded by 200 FARC elements while Ecuadorian forces were engaging in a mission to verify the events on the border, but that the Colombian forces were "trying to buy time" to return to Colombia after attacking the FARC camp. The Ecuadorian government stated it had intercepted communications showing this and that the Colombian forces knew they had entered Ecuador.<ref></ref>

Colombian Minister of Defense Juan Manuel Santos stated that the operation of Colombian troops could have been avoided with a greater cooperation from Quito. "If we had any real collaboration from Ecuador to pursue these groups, this kind of situations wouldn't occur, but we have never had it. They always have taken the position that they do not want to interfere in the Colombian conflict", said Santos.<ref></ref>

At a ten-hour emergency meeting of the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States held in the afternoon of March 4, Ecuador urged the OAS to condemn Colombia's violation of its territorial integrity. Colombia, in response, insisted that the hemispheric body roundly condemn terrorism and its funding. Due to disagreements regarding content, the Council was unable to produce a final declaration on the matter. It did, however, agree to reconvene on March 5 to continue its debates, to convene a meeting of consultation of the member states' foreign ministers on March 17, and to set up an ad hoc fact-finding mission to investigate the incident.<ref>

In Brazil as part of a five-nation tour to drum up support for his country's position, President Correa said Ecuador would reestablish diplomatic relations with Colombia "in the very improbable circumstance" of that country offering an unrestricted apology, ensuring that no similar incidents take place in the future, and retracting its allegations of ties between Quito and the FARC. He also emphasized that had any Ecuadorians died in the attack, "we would already be at war".<ref>
