'''Конфуцианството''' е преди всичко философско течение. От религиозна гледна точка то има жертвопринасянето. Значително място заема култът към прадедите и вярата в духове.

Конфуцианството става официална Ин и Ян (дуаизъм) и петте първи елемента У-син. 

Конфуцианството (жу цзя - школата на книжниците), също като и даоизма, се е зародило в Китай през VІ - V век пр.н.е. Влиза в състава на Сан цзяо - една от трите главни религии в Китай. Философската система на конфуцианството е била създадена от Кун-цзи (Конфуций).

Предшественици на конфуцианците са произлизали от потомствени чиновнически семейства, които в случай на загубване на официалната длъжност са ставали скитащи учители. Тези хора заработвали хляба си с преподаването на древните книги, станали впоследствие част от Тринадесетокнижието: Шацзин, Шуцзин, Лицзи, а също и загубената по-късно Юецзин (Книга за музиката)
Централно място в учението на Кун-цзи заема концепцията Жен (човечността) - идеалните отношения между хората в семейството, в обществото и в държавата. Основен принцип на тази концепция е "Това, което не желаеш да правят на теб, не го прави на другите".
 
Особено място при Кун-цзи е заемала концепцията Сяо - синовната почтителност, уважаване на родителите и на по-възрастните въобще. Сяо е било смятано за основата на Жен и другите добродетели са най-ефективния метод за управление на страната.

Голямо значение се е придавало на Юе - музиката, като най-доброто средство за променяне на лошите нрави и обичаи, а също Ли - етикета - правилата за благопристойност, регулиращи поведението на човека в различните жизнени ситуации.

Една от основите на конфуцианството е учението чжен мин (изправяне на имената), което изисквало от всеки човек твърдо да помни своето място в обществото.

Конфуцианството е получило признание едва след смъртта на Кун-цзи.
След смъртта на Кун-цзи конфуцианството се разпаднало на следните школи:

·   Мен-цзи

·   Сюн-цзи

'''Confucianism''' () is an ancient Chinese ethical and philosophical system originally developed from the teachings of the early Chinese philosopher moral, social, political, philosophical, and quasi-religious thought that has had tremendous influence on the culture and history of East Asia. Some consider it to be the state religion of East Asian countries because of governmental promotion of Confucian values.

The Mainland China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam, as well as various territories settled predominantly by Chinese people. 

==History==

Confucianism was chosen by Chinese state. Despite its loss of influence during the Tang Dynasty, Confucian doctrine remained a mainstream Chinese orthodoxy for two millennia until the 20th century and it was still in most parts of China, when it was attacked by radical Chinese thinkers as a vanguard of a pre-modern system and an obstacle to China's modernization, eventually culminating in its repression during the Cultural Revolution in the People's Republic of China. Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, Confucianism has been revived in mainland China, and both interest in and debate about Confucianism have surged. 

Confucianism as passed down to the 19th and 20th centuries derives primarily from the school of the Neo-Confucians, led by Song and later Taoist and Buddhist ideas with existing Confucian ideas to create a more complete metaphysics than had ever existed before. At the same time, many forms of Confucianism have historically declared themselves opposed to the Buddhist and Taoist belief systems.

social philosopher of China whose teachings have deeply influenced East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan for two thousand five hundred years. The relationship between Confucianism and Confucius himself, however, is tenuous. Confucius' ideas were not accepted during his lifetime and he frequently bemoaned the fact that he remained unemployed by any of the feudal lords. 

As with many other prominent figures, such as Buddha, Confucius did not leave any writings to put forward  his ideas. Instead, only texts with recollections by his disciples and their students are available. This factor is further complicated by the "Burning of the Books and Burying of the Scholars", a massive suppression of dissenting thought during the Qin Dynasty, more than two centuries after Confucius' death. 

However, we can sketch out Confucius' ideas from the fragments that remain. Confucius was a kings contending for supremacy in China.

In the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (772 BCE&ndash;221 BCE), the reigning king of the Zhou gradually became a mere figurehead. In this power vacuum, the rulers of small states began to vie with one another for military and political dominance. Deeply persuaded of the need for his mission &mdash; "If right principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no need for me to change its state" ''Analects'' XVIII, 6 &mdash; Confucius tirelessly promoted the virtues of ancient illustrious sages such as the Duke of Zhou. Confucius tried to amass sufficient political power to found a new dynasty, as when he planned to accept an invitation from a rebel to "make a Zhou dynasty in the East" (''Analects'' XV, 5). As the common saying that Confucius was a "king without a crown" indicates, however, he never gained the opportunity to apply his ideas. He was expelled from states many times and eventually returned to his homeland to spend the last part of his life teaching. The ''Analects of Confucius'', the closest primary source we have for his thoughts, relates his sayings and discussions with rulers and disciples in short passages. There is considerable debate over how to interpret the Analects.

Unlike most American philosophers, Confucius did not rely on Legalists (a kind of law-based early totalitarianism, quite distant from virtue-based Confucianism) and conceived the state system that allowed Qin Shi Huang to unify China under the strong state control of every human activity. The culmination of Confucius' dream of unification and peace in China can therefore be argued to have come from Legalism, a school of thought almost diametrically opposed to his reliance on rites and virtue.

	Confucianism, refers to an ancient system of Chinese moral, political, philosophical, and religious traditions. These traditions which focus mainly on good deeds, as well as human mortality, have influenced many parts of  Eastern Asia, and Confucianism is often considered to be the state religion of the majority of East Asian countries, because of the governmental promotion of the values of the Confucian system.
	Confucianism was originally selected by Han Wudi (141 BCE - 86 BCE) to use as a political system to govern his Chinese state. Despite its loss of power during the previous dynasty. The Confucian doctrine remained a mainstream as China’s accepted view for over two millennia, until the 20th century and it was still in many parts of China, until it was attacked by irrational Chinese thinkers as a forefront of a pre-modern system and an obstacle to China's revolution, eventually ending in its authoritarianism  during the Cultural Revolution in the People's Republic of China. Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, Confucianism has been revived in mainland China, and both interest in and debate about Confucianism have since rose.
	Form the 19th century up until the 20th century, Confucianism, derived primarily from the school of the New Confucians, led by the man who gave Confucianism renewed vigor throughout the Song and many much later dynasties. Neo-Confucianism combined both Taoist and Buddhist ideas with existing Confucian ideas to create a more complete philosophy than had ever been proposed before. At the same time, several Confucians have historically declared themselves to be opposed to the Buddhist as well as the Taoist belief systems, making a compromise between the three literally impossible.
	The man who originally proposed this religion, Confucius (551 BCE – 479 BCE) was an important social philosopher and sage of China whose wisdom, and teachings have deeply influenced parts of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan for nearly two thousand five hundred years. The connection between Confucianism and Confucius himself, however, is fragile. Since Confucius' ideas were never acknowledged during his lifetime and he frequently regretted the fact that he remained unwaged by any of the feudal lords.
	Unlike most European and American philosophers, Confucius did not rely on deductive reasoning to convince his spectators. Instead, he used figures of speech such as comparison and cliché to declare his opinions. Most of the time these techniques were highly out of contex. For these reasons, European and American readers might find his philosophy muddled or unclear. However, Confucius claimed that he sought "a unity all pervading" and that there was "one single thread binding my way together." The first occurrences of a real Confucian system may have been created by his disciples or by their disciples. During the philosophically fertile period of the Hundred Schools of Thought, great early figures of Confucianism such as Mencius and Xun Zi developed Confucianism into an ethical and political doctrine. Both had to fight contemporary ideas and gain the ruler's confidence through argumentation and reasoning. Mencius gave Confucianism a fuller explanation of human nature, of what is needed for good government, of what morality is, and founded his idealist doctrine on the claim that human nature is good. Xun Zi opposed many of Mencius' ideas, and built a structured system upon the idea that human nature is bad and had to be educated and exposed to the rites, before being able to express their goodness for the people. Some of Xun Zi's disciples, such as Han Feizi and Li Si, became Legalists and conceived the state system that allowed Qin Shi Huang to unify China under the strong state control of every human activity. The culmination of Confucius' dream of unification and peace in China can therefore be argued to have come from Legalism, a school of thought almost diametrically opposed to his reliance on rites and virtue.

==Rites==
<blockquote>
"Lead the people with administrative injunctions and put them in their place with penal law, and they will avoid punishments but will be without a sense of shame. Lead them with excellence and put them in their place through roles and ritual practices, and in addition to developing a sense of shame, they will order themselves harmoniously."
(''Analects'' II, 3)

</blockquote>
The above explains an essential difference between legalism and ritualism and points to a key difference between European / American and East Asian societies, particularly in the realm of an individual's moral compass, when deserving of punishment for breaking penal law.

Of course, as with all translations of literature from ancient sources, excessive literal analysis of one particular translation may lead to unfounded conclusions.
An example would be the following passage, the exact same as the one just provided.

''"The Master said, 'Guide them by edicts, keep them in line with punishments, and the common people will stay out of trouble but will have no sense of shame. Guide them by virtue, keep them in line with the rites, and they will, besides having a sense of shame, reform themselves.''

(''Analects'' II, 3)

Varying translations throughout the 18th, 19th, 20th, and now this century have created a large and diverse collection based on the originals.  Therefore, only studying all of these translations would allow accurate analysis of the ancient text.  The availability of numerous qualified sources for these translations in the modern age can lead to a true "general consensus" of what message Confucius meant to imply. 

Confucius argues that under law, ''external'' authorities administer punishments ''after'' illegal actions, so people generally behave well without understanding reasons why they should; where as with ritual, patterns of behavior are ''losing face. In this sense, "rite" () is an ideal form of social norm.

The Chinese character for "rites" previously had the religious meaning of "sacrifice". Its Confucian meaning ranges from politeness and propriety to the understanding of each person's correct place in society. Externally, ritual is used to distinguish between people; their usage allows people to know at all times who is the younger and who the elder, who is the guest and who the host and so forth. Internally, they indicate to people their duty amongst others and what to expect from them.

Internalization is the main process in ritual. Formalized behavior becomes progressively internalized, desires are channeled and personal cultivation becomes the mark of social correctness. Though this idea conflicts with the common saying that "the cowl does not make the monk", in Confucianism sincerity is what enables behavior to be absorbed by individuals. Obeying ritual with sincerity makes ritual the most powerful way to cultivate oneself. Thus, <blockquote>
"Respectfulness, without the Rites, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, without the Rites, become timidity; boldness, without the Rites, becomes insubordination; straightforwardness, without the Rites, becomes rudeness" (''Analects'' VIII, 2).
</blockquote>
Ritual can be seen as a means to find the balance between opposing qualities that might otherwise lead to conflict.

Ritual divides people into categories and builds hierarchical relationships through protocols and ceremonies, assigning everyone a place in society and a form of behavior. Music that seems to have played a significant role in Confucius' life is given as an exception as it transcends such boundaries, 'unifying the hearts'.

Although the ''Analects'' promotes ritual heavily, Confucius himself often behaved otherwise; for example, when he cried at his preferred disciple's death, or when he met a fiendish princess (VI, 28). Later more rigid ritualisms who forgot that ritual is "more than presents of jade and silk" (XVII, 12) strayed from their master's position.

==Governance==
thumb|250px|Confucian temple in [[Kaohsiung, Taiwan, Republic of China]]
<blockquote>
"To govern by virtue, let us compare it to the North Star: it stays in its place, while the myriad stars wait upon it."
(''Analects'' II, 1)
</blockquote>
Another key Confucian concept is that in order to govern others one must first govern oneself. When developed sufficiently, the king's personal virtue spreads beneficent influence throughout the kingdom. This idea is developed further in the Taoist concept of wu wei (): the less the king does, the more that is done. By being the "calm centre" around which the kingdom turns, the king allows everything to function smoothly and avoids having to tamper with the individual parts of the whole.

This idea may be traced back to early shamanistic beliefs, such as that the king () being the axle between the sky, human beings and the Earth. The character itself shows the three levels of the universe, united by a single line. Another complementary view is that this idea may have been used by ministers and counsellors to deter aristocratic whims that would otherwise be to the detriment of the population.

== Meritocracy ==
<blockquote>
"In teaching, there should be no distinction of classes."</br>
(''Analects'' XV, 39)
</blockquote>
Although Confucius claimed that he never invented anything but was only transmitting ancient knowledge (see ''Analects'' VII, 1), he did produce a number of new ideas. Many European and American admirers such as English. A virtuous plebeian who cultivates his qualities can be a "gentleman", while a shameless son of the king is only a "small man". That he allowed students of different classes to be his disciples is a clear demonstration that he fought against the feudal structures in Chinese society.

Another new idea, that of meritocracy, led to the introduction of the Imperial examination system in China. This system allowed anyone who passed an examination to become a government officer, a position which would bring wealth and honor to the whole family. The Chinese examination system seems to have been started in 165 BCE, when certain candidates for public office were called to the Chinese capital for examination of their moral excellence by the emperor. Over the following centuries the system grew until finally almost anyone who wished to become an official had to prove his worth by passing written government examinations.

Confucius praised those kings who left their kingdoms to those apparently most qualified rather than to their elder sons. His achievement was the setting up of a school that produced statesmen with a strong sense of state and duty, known as 儒家 (). During the Warring States Period and the early Han dynasty, China grew greatly and the need for a solid and centralized corporation of government officers able to read and write administrative papers arose. As a result, Confucianism was promoted and the men it produced became an effective counter to the remaining landowner aristocrats otherwise threatening the unity of the state. 

Since then Confucianism has been used as a kind of "state religion", with authoritarianism, legitimism, paternalism, and submission to authority used as political tools to rule China. Most emperors used a mix of legalism and Confucianism as their ruling doctrine, often with the latter embellishing the former.

==Themes in Confucian thought==
A simple way to appreciate Confucian thought is to consider it as being based on varying levels of honesty. In practice, the elements of Confucianism accumulated over time and matured into the following forms:

===Ritual===
In Confucianism the term "ritual(Chinese 礼, pinyin lǐ)" was soon extended to include secular ceremonial behavior before being used to refer to the propriety or politeness which colors everyday life. Rituals were codified and treated as a comprehensive system of norms. Confucius himself tried to revive the etiquette of earlier dynasties. After his death, people regarded him as a great authority on ritual behaviors. 

It is important to note that "ritual" has a different meaning in the context of Confucianism, especially today, from its context in many religions. In Confucianism, the acts that people tend to carry out in every day life are considered ritual. Rituals are not necessarily regimented or arbitrary practices, but the routines that people often undergo knowingly or unknowingly through out their lives. Shaping the rituals in a way that leads to a content and healthy society, and to content and healthy people, is one purpose of Confucian philosophy.

===Relationships===
One theme central to Confucianism is that of relationships, and the differing duties arising from the different status one held in relation to others. Individuals are held to simultaneously stand in different degrees of relationship with different people, namely, as a junior in relation to their parents and elders, and as a senior in relation to their younger siblings, students, and others. While juniors are considered in Confucianism to owe strong duties of reverence and service to their seniors, seniors also have duties of benevolence and concern toward juniors. This theme consistently manifests itself in many aspects of East Asian cultures even to this day, with extensive filial duties on the part of children toward parents and elders, and great concern of parents toward their children.

Social harmony -- the great goal of Confucianism -- thus results partly from every individual knowing his or her place in the social order and playing his or her part well. When Duke Jing of Qi asked about government, by which he meant proper administration so as to bring social harmony, Confucius replied,
<blockquote>
"There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son." (''Analects'' XII, 11, tr. Legge). 
</blockquote>

====Filial piety ====
"Filial piety" () is considered among the greatest of virtues and must be shown towards both the living and the dead (ancestors). The term "filial", meaning "of a child", denotes the respect that a child, originally a son, should show to his parents. This relationship was extended by analogy to a series of ''five relationships'' ()<ref>[http://ias.berkeley.edu/orias/summer2004/summer2004Chinalegal.htm Chinese Legal Theories<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>:

# Sovereign to subject
# Parent to child
# Husband to wife
# Elder to younger sibling
# Friend to friend (The members of this relationship are equal to one another)

Specific duties were prescribed to each of the participants in these sets of relationships. Such duties were also extended to the dead, where the living stood as sons to their deceased family. This led to the veneration of ancestors.
