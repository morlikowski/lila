'''David Byrne''' (born Scottish-American musician and artist. He is perhaps best known as a founding member and principal songwriter of the new wave band Grammy, Oscar and Church of the SubGenius<ref>[http://www.subgenius.com/bigfist/fun/trivia/X0009_CELEB.TXT.html Celebrities in the COS] "David Byrne is a dues-paying Member, although we haven't heard from him
since the TRUE STORIES mess"</ref>.

==Early years==
Byrne was born in Dumbarton, Scotland, on May 14, 1952. Two years later, his parents moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and then to Arbutus, Maryland, when he was 8 or 9 years old. He graduated from Lansdowne High School in southwest Baltimore County.  He then attended the Rhode Island School of Design for one year before dropping out and forming Talking Heads in 1974 with fellow RISD students Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, later joined by Jerry Harrison. He also attended the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, Maryland, for one year.

During his time in the band, Byrne took on outside projects, collaborating with ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'', which attracted considerable critical acclaim and featured a groundbreaking use of sampling.

Byrne married costume designer Adelle Lutz in 1987. They have a daughter, Malu Abeni Valentine Byrne, born in 1990. Byrne and Lutz divorced in 2004. Byrne currently lives in New York City.

==Varied work==
In 1981, Byrne partnered with Broadway that same year.   ''In Spite of Wishing and Wanting'' is a soundscape David Byrne produced for the Belgian dance company Ultima Vez.  

His work has been extensively used in movie soundtracks, most notably in collaboration with Lead Us Not Into Temptation (music from the film "Young Adam")'' included tracks and musical experiments from his score to True Stories'', a musical collage of quirky Americana released in 1986, as well as directing the documentary ''Île Aiye'' and the concert film of his 1992 Latin-tinged tour titled ''Between the Teeth''.  He was chiefly responsible for the stage design and choreography of ''Stop Making Sense'' in 1984. 

Byrne wrote the Robert Wilson's Opera ''The Knee Plays'' from ''The Forest'' was originally used in a Wilson-directed theatre piece with the same name. ''The Forest'' premiered at the Theater der Freien Volksbuhne, Berlin in 1988.  It received its New York premiere in December 1988 at BAM, the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The Forestry Maxi-single contained dance and industrial remixes of pieces from The Forest by Jack Dangers, Rudy Tambala, and Anthony Capel.

Byrne also appeared as a guest vocalist/guitarist for 10,000 Maniacs during their MTV Unplugged concert, though the songs in which he is featured were cut from its album. One of them, "Let the Mystery Be", appeared as the fourth track on 10,000 Maniacs' cd single "Few and Far Between".

Byrne also worked with "Queen of Tex-Mex", Dreaming of You", before Selena's death.
 
Byrne was the host of "Sessions at West 54th" during its second of three seasons.

Byrne founded Luaka Bop, a world music record label which releases the work of artists Cornershop, Os Mutantes, Los De Abajo, Jim White, Zap Mama, Tom Zé, Los Amigos Invisibles and others.

Byrne is also a visual artist, and has shown his work in contemporary art galleries and museums around the world since the 1990s.  He has also created a number of public art installations, many of them anonymous. He is represented by Pace/MacGill Gallery, NYC.

==Recent activity==
In 2001 a censored version of Byrne's single "Like Humans Do" was selected by Microsoft as the sample music for Windows XP to demonstrate Windows Media Player (not included in SP2 installs). <ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2001/aug01/08-01DavidByrnePR.mspx David Byrne to Provide Promotional Music for Windows XP: "Like Humans Do" to Give Music Fans a Taste of the Digital Music Experience in Windows XP<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.forbes.com/2001/08/21/0821byrne.html You May Find Yourself On Windows XP - Forbes.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.  The next year, he provided vocals for a track, "Lazy" by X-Press 2, which reached number 2 in the United Kingdom and number 1 on the U.S. Dance Charts. David said in an interview in BBC Four Sessions's coverage of his Union Chapel performance that Lazy was number 1 in Syria.

In April 2003, Byrne appeared as himself in an episode of ''The Simpsons'', "Dude, Where's My Ranch?".

In late 2003, Byrne released a book with a companion DVD called ''Envisioning Emotional Epistemological Information'' (ISBN 3-88243-907-6). The work included artwork composed entirely in Microsoft PowerPoint. It includes one image that depicts, according to Byrne, "Dan Rather's profile. Expanded to the nth degree. Taken to infinity. Overlaid on the back of Patrick Stewart's head." <ref>[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/ppt1.html Wired 11.09: Learning to Love PowerPoint<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Byrne's latest solo album, ''Grown Backwards'', was released on March 16th, 2004 by Nonesuch.  This album used orchestral string arrangements, and includes two operatic arias. He also launched a North American and Australian tour with the Tosca Strings. This tour ended with Los Angeles, San Diego and New York shows in August 2005.  The following year, his singing was featured on "The Heart's a Lonely Hunter" on ''The Cosmic Game'' by Thievery Corporation.

In 2005, Byrne initiated his own internet radio station, Radio David Byrne<ref>{{cite web

Byrne's playlists have included African Popular Music; Rednecks, Racists, & Reactionaries: Country Classics; Vox Humana; Classical Opera; Italian Movie Music. Byrne also posts personal comments on the music and, occasionally, on the state of the recorded music industry. In July 2007, Byrne posted the following comment: {{blockquote|There was another piece in the Times today about yet another 20 percent drop in CD sales. (Are they running the same news piece every 4 months?) Jeez guys, the writing's on the wall. How long do the record execs think they'll have those offices and nice parking spaces? (Well, more than half of all record A&R and other execs are gone already, so there should be plenty of parking space). They, the big 4 or 5, should give the catalogues back to the artists or their heirs as a gesture before they close the office doors, as they sure don't know how to sell music anymore. (I have Talking Heads stuff on the shelf that I can't get Warner to release.) The "industry" had a nice 50-year ride, but it's time to move on. Luckily, music remains more or less unaffected — there is a lot of great music out there. A new model will emerge that includes rather than sues its own customers, that realizes that music is not a product in the sense of being a thing — it's closer to fashion, in that for music fans it tells them and their friends who they are, what they feel passionately about and to some extent what makes life fun and interesting. It's about a sense of community — a song ties a whole invisible disparate community together. It's not about selling the (often) shattered plastic case CDs used to come in.<ref>{{cite web
