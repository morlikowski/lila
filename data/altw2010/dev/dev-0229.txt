==Plot==

Michael Jennings (Affleck) is a reverse engineer who routinely has his recent memories erased after working on sensitive high-tech projects.  He is often helped by his friend Shorty (Giamatti).  He agrees to take on a project for James Rethrick (Eckhart), his old college roommate and close personal friend; Rethrick is CEO of Allcom.  All Jennings is told is that he is to design something for three years in exchange for Allcom shares which will be worth a minimum of 10 million dollars. He meets and falls in love with Dr. Rachel Porter (Thurman), an Allcom biologist.  However, after working for three years on the secret project, he wakes up with his memory erased and learns that he signed away his shares in Allcom, which are worth 92 million dollars. He is left only with an envelope of personal items – most of which he doesn't recognize. It contains the following, seemingly unrelated items:

#a pack of cigarettes (used to escape from the FBI by setting off the fire suppressants in an interrogation room, creating a smoke screen – without it he would have died during interrogation)
#a pair of tinted sunglasses (allows Jennings to see through the smoke, enabling a quick escape)
#a bus pass (the only item common to both the film and original short story; allows Jennings to escape quickly through a bus terminal – the FBI must jump the turnstiles)
#a diamond ring (allows a street kid to steal it; had it not happened, Jennings would not have returned to the bank where he received the envelope so he could ask more questions about its origins)
#a fortune from a fortune cookie with lucky numbers printed on the back (winning lottery numbers, and clues to the location of the ticket - proof of the envelope's prophetic nature)
#a janitor's key (allows friend to access circuit breakers, creating a distraction)
#a can of hair spray (used with lighter as a makeshift flamethrower)
#a cigarette lighter (used with hair spray as a makeshift flamethrower)
#a paper clip (used to short-circuit electronics to avoid being hit by subway train)
#a matchbook (specifies a restaurant where he has a reservation, disguised with water-soluble paint as "new liberty saving" bank)
#a R1150R Rockster motorcycle)
#a loupe (allows him to notice discrepancy on stamp)
#a postage stamp on the envelope (contains microfilm with snapshots from the future – the fact that it's Albert Einstein on the stamp is a clue)
#a small container of ball bearings (used to set off metal detectors, creating a distraction at security)
#a keycard to Allcom's facility (allows him to re-enter his lab)
#a hex key (used to open lab door security panel)
#an Eisenhower Dollar (used to jam lab door security panel)
#a crossword puzzle (locates hardware bug on the machine, allowing him to repair it)
#a .45 Caliber cartridge (used to destroy the machine – fired into hydrogen tank by a cycling piston)
#a watch (alerts him when to duck a bullet)

Soon he discovers that Allcom security personnel (led by Feore) are after him for some unknown reason, as is the FBI, agents of which tell him he committed treason against the United States. However, using the items now in his possession, Jennings is able to devise ways out of various predicaments and crises.

He soon discovers that he spent the last three years of his life designing and building a curvature of the universe, and thus, into the future; this was theorized by physicist William Dekker (Serge Houde), who had been killed for his work by Allcom agents. After building the machine, Jennings used it to catch a glimpse of the future, foreseeing his own death by gunshot wound.  He also learns that the machine is prone to dispensing self-fulfilling prophecies (i.e., a plague is predicted – all those it says are infected are isolated in camps with conditions that create the plague. A war is predicted – the enemy it predicts is attacked first thereby causing the war). Ultimately, human responses to the machine's predictions lead to the downfall of humanity. In desperation, Jennings used the machine in an attempt to escape his death and ultimately destroy his creation. However, since he was completely isolated on the Allcom grounds, he was limited to leaving himself an envelope of innocent, everyday items.

Jennings and Porter make their escape after Rethrick is killed by an undercover FBI sniper (with the bullet that, in an alternative future, would have slain Jennings).  The future-viewing device is destroyed as is Rethrick's assistant.  

The "paycheck" comes at the end of the movie, when Jennings finds a winning 90 million dollar lottery ticket hidden under the newspaper lining the bottom of Porter's birdcage. This fulfills the fortune cookie's message from earlier in the film, "If you only look where you can't go, you will miss the riches below."

'''''Paycheck''''' è un film di fantascienza del 2003 diretto da John Woo, tratto da un omonimo racconto del 1953 dello scrittore statunitense Philip K. Dick (pubblicato in italiano come ''I labirinti della memoria'').

== Trama ==

Michael Jennings è un brillante ingegnere che lavora per diverse società nella costruzione di complessi macchinari. L'unica clausola dei suo contratti è che alla fine i ricordi relativi al suo ultimo lavoro devono essere rimossi. Un giorno però si risveglia senza alcun pagamento per l'ultimo impiego durato tre anni, con soltanto un pacchetto di oggetti che non riconosce come propri e praticamente inutili. Come piccoli pezzi di puzzle questi lo aiuteranno a ricostruire il quadro della situazione mentre alcuni loschi individui iniziano a dargli la caccia.
