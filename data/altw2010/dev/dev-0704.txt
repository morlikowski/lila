'''Folkemord''' omtales i FNs konvensjon av 9. desember 1948 om forhindring og avstraffelse av forbrytelsen folkemord (folkemordkonvensjonen). Her defineres folkemord som: <br>
«en hvilken som helst av de følgende handlinger som er begått i den hensikt å ødelegge helt, eller delvis, en nasjonal, etnisk, rasemessig eller religiøs gruppe som sådan:
* å drepe medlemmer av gruppen;
* å forårsake alvorlig legemlig eller sjelelig skade på medlemmer av gruppen;
* bevisst å la gruppen utsettes for levevilkår som tar sikte på å bevirke dens
fysiske ødeleggelse helt eller delvis;
* å påtvinge tiltak som tar sikte på å forhindre fødsler innen gruppen;
* med makt å overføre barn fra gruppen til en annen gruppe.»

==Bakgrunn==

Den polsk-jødiske juristen Raphael Lemkin introduserte under den annen verdenskrig begrepet folkemord, eller ''genocid'' (gresk ''genos'' betyr familie eller stamme, ''cide'' betyr mord). Folkemord var, ifølge Lemkin, å drepe andre mennesker på grunnlag av hva de var, for eksempel trosretning, etnisk tilhørighet, seksuell legning eller kjønn, og ikke på grunn av noe de hadde gjort, som for eksempel å gjøre opprør eller revolusjon. 

Etter lenge å ha vist interesse for den omdiskuterte armenia-massakren, og på hans egen tid, det jødiske holocaust, ville Lemkin lage en lov som kunne vise at systematiske drap på mennesker på grunn av rase, tro eller religion var en forbrytelse som overgikk alle andre forbrytelser en stat og dens innbyggere kunne gjøre seg skyldig i. Loven skulle forhindre slike grusomheter fra å skje igjen.

I Slobodan Milosevic i Det internasjonale krigsforbrytertribunalet for det tidligere Jugoslavia. Han var den første statslederen som var i retten for folkemord. Han døde før en dom ble avsagt.

I august 2006 ble Iraks tidligere president  kurdiske befolkningen i Nordirak. Dødsdommen mot Hussein omfattet ikke anfal-kampanjen, men   Ali   Hassan al-Majid - kjent som ''kjemiske Ali'' -  som var den militære lederen for anfalkampanjen  ble dømt til døden for sitt ansvar.

'''Genocide''' is the deliberate and systematic destruction of an ethnic, racial, religious, or national group.

While precise definition varies among genocide scholars, a ethnical<!-- This is a quote. The original is 'ethnical'. See www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/p_genoci.htm-->, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."<ref>Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. ''Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.'' http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/p_genoci.htm</ref>

The United Nations has stated that instances of genocide have taken place throughout history, but it was not until Raphael Lemkin coined the term genocide and the prosecution of perpetrators of the Holocaust at the Nuremberg trials that the international community agreed to a treaty &mdash; Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) &mdash; which defined the crime of genocide under international law.

There was a gap of more than forty years between the CPPCG coming into force and the first  prosecution under the provision of the treaty.  To date all international prosecutions of genocide, for the Rwandan Genocide, the Srebrenica Genocide, have been  by ''ad hoc'' international tribunals.  The International Criminal Court came into existence in 2002 and it has the authority to try people from the states that have signed the treaty, but to date it has not tried anyone. 

Since the CPPCG came into effect in January 1951 about 80 member states of the United Nations have passed legislation that incorporates the provisions of the CPPCG into their municipal law, and some perpetrators of genocide have been found guilty under such municipal laws such as Nikola Jorgic who was found guilt of genocide by a German court (Jorgic v. Germany). 

Critics of the CPPCG point to the narrow definition of the groups that are protected under the treaty, particularly the lack of protection for political groups for what has been termed politicide. One of the problems was that until there was a body of case law from prosecutions, the precise definition of what the treaty meant had not been tested in court. For example what precisely did the term "in part" mean? As more perpetrators have been tried under international tribunals and municipal court cases, a body of legal arguments and legal interpretations are helping to address these issues.

Another criticism of the CPPCG is that when it provisions have been invoked by the United Nations Security Council, they have only been invoked to punish those who have already committed genocide and been foolish enough to leave a paper trail. It was this criticism that lead to the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1674 by the United Nations Security Council on 28 April 2006 commits the Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict and to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.

Genocide scholars such Gregory Stanton have postulated that conditions and acts that often occur before, during, and after genocide, such as dehumanization of victim groups, strong organization of genocidal groups, and denial of genocide by its perpetrators which can be identified and actions taken to stop genocides before they happen. Critics of this approach such as Dirk Moses think that this is unrealistic and that for example "Darfur will end when it suits the great powers that have a stake in the region".

==Coining of the term genocide==
The term "genocide" was coined by Polish-Greek root ''génos'' (γένος)  (''family, tribe'' or ''race'' - ''gene''); secondly from Latin ''-cide'' (''occido''—to ''massacre'', ''kill'').

In Noah Assyrians<ref name="Euro">[http://www.europaworld.org/issue40/raphaellemkin22601.htm Raphael Lemkin] - EuropeWorld, 22/6/2001</ref> massacred in slaughter of Armenians" during World War I.<ref name="Euro" /> He presented his first proposal to outlaw such "acts of barbarism" to the Legal Council of the League of Nations in Madrid the same year. The proposal failed, and his work incurred the disapproval of the Polish government, which was at the time pursuing a policy of conciliation with Nazi Germany.<ref name="Euro" />

In indictment of the 24 Nazi leaders specifies in Count 3 that the defendants "conducted deliberate and systematic genocide—namely, the extermination of racial and national groups..."<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'' "Genocide" citing ''Sunday Times'' 21 October 1945.</ref>) Lemkin presented a draft resolution for a Genocide Convention treaty to a number of countries in an effort to persuade them to sponsor the resolution. With the support of the United States, the resolution was placed before the General Assembly for consideration. Defining genocide in 1943, Lemkin wrote: 

==Genocide as a crime==
===Under international law===
In the wake of The Holocaust, Lemkin successfully campaigned for the universal acceptance of international laws defining and forbidding genocide. This was achieved in 1948, with the promulgation of the ''Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide''.

The ''CPPCG'' was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 9 December 1948 and came into effect on 12 January 1951 (Resolution 260 (III)). It contains an internationally-recognized definition of genocide which was incorporated into the national criminal legislation of many countries, and was also adopted by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the treaty that established the International Criminal Court (ICC). The Convention (in article 2) defines genocide: 

{{quotation|...any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
:(a) Killing members of the group; 
:(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
:(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
:(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
:(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Article II}}

The first draft of the Convention included political killings, but the USSR<ref> </ref> along with some other nations would not accept that actions against groups identified as holding similar political opinions or social status would constitute genocide, <ref>]</ref> so these stipulations were subsequently removed in a political and diplomatic compromise.

{{quotation|
The Convention was manifestly adopted for humanitarian and civilizing purposes. Its objectives are to safeguard the very existence of certain human groups and to affirm and emphasize the most elementary principles of humanity and morality. In view of the rights involved, the legal obligations to refrain from genocide are recognized as ''erga omnes''. 
</br></br>
When the Convention was drafted, it was already envisaged that it would apply not only to then existing forms of genocide, but also "to any method that might be evolved in the future with a view to destroying the physical existence of a group".<ref>From a statement made by Mr. Morozov, representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, on 19 April 1948 during the debate in the Ad Hoc Committee on Genocide (E/AC.25/SR.12).</ref> As emphasized in the preamble to the Convention, genocide has marred all periods of history, and it is this very tragic recognition that gives the concept its historical evolutionary nature.
</br></br>
The Convention must be interpreted in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms, in their context, and in the light of its object and purpose. Moreover, the text of the Convention should be interpreted in such a way that a reason and a meaning can be attributed to every word. No word or provision may be disregarded or treated as superfluous, unless this is absolutely necessary to give effect to the terms read as a whole.<ref>See Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, opened for signature on 23 May 1969, United Nations Treaty Series, vol. 1155, No. I-18232.</ref>
</br></br>
Genocide is a crime under international law regardless of "whether committed in time of peace or in time of war" (art. I). Thus, irrespective of the context in which it occurs (for example, peace time, internal strife, international armed conflict or whatever the general overall situation) genocide is a punishable international crime.

====Intent to destroy====

In 1997 the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), noted in its judgement on ''Jorgic v. Germany'' case that in 1992 the majority of legal scholars took the narrow view that "intent to destroy" in the CPPCG meant the intended physical-biological destruction of the protected group and that this was still the majority opinion. But the ECHR also noted that a minority took a broader view and did not consider biological-physical destruction was necessary as the intent to destroy a group as a social unit was enough to qualify as genocide.<ref>European Court of Human Rights [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/viewhbkm.asp?sessionId=1448788&skin=hudoc-en&action=html&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649&key=63590&highlight= Judgement in Jorgic v. Germany (Application no. 74613/01)] paragraphs 18, 36,74</ref> 

In the same judgement the ECHR reviewed the judgements of several international and municipal courts judgements. It noted that International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Court of Justice had agreed with the narrow interpretation, that biological-physical destruction was necessary for an act to qualify as genocide. The ECHR also noted that at the time of its the judgement, apart from courts in Germany which had taken a broad view, that there had been few cases of genocide under other Convention States municipal laws and that "There are no reported cases in which the courts of these States have defined the type of group destruction the perpetrator must have intended in order to be found guilty of genocide".<ref>European Court of Human Rights [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/viewhbkm.asp?sessionId=1448788&skin=hudoc-en&action=html&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649&key=63590&highlight= Judgement in Jorgic v. Germany (Application no. 74613/01)] paragraphs 43-46</ref>

====In part====

The phrase "in whole or in part" has been subject to much discussion by scholars of international humanitarian law.<ref>[http://efchr.mcgill.ca/WhatIsGenocide_en.php?menu=2 What is Genocide?] McGill Faculty of Law (McGill University)</ref> The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia found in ''Prosecutor v. Radislav Krstic - Trial Chamber I - Judgment - IT-98-33 (2001) ICTY8 (2 August 2001)''<ref>[http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICTY/2001/8.html Prosecutor v.

Radislav Krstic - Appeals Chamber - Judgment - IT-98-33 (2004) ICTY 7 (19 April 2004)''<ref name=PvRKappel>[http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICTY/2004/7.html Prosecutor v. Radislav Krstic - Appeals Chamber - Judgment - IT-98-33 (2004) ICTY 7 (19 April 2004)]</ref> paragraphs 8, 9, 10, and 11 addressed the issue of ''in part'' and found that "the part must be a substantial part of that group. The aim of the Genocide Convention is to prevent the intentional destruction of entire human groups, and the part targeted must be significant enough to have an impact on the group as a whole." The Appeals Chamber goes into details of other cases and the opinions of respected commentators on the Genocide Convention to explain how they came to this conclusion.

The judges continue in paragraph 12, "The determination of when the targeted part is substantial enough to meet this requirement may involve a number of considerations. The numeric size of the targeted part of the group is the necessary and important starting point, though not in all cases the ending point of the inquiry. The number of individuals targeted should be evaluated not only in absolute terms, but also in relation to the overall size of the entire group. In addition to the numeric size of the targeted portion, its prominence within the group can be a useful consideration. If a specific part of the group is emblematic of the overall group, or is essential to its survival, that may support a finding that the part qualifies as substantial within the meaning of Article 4 [of the Tribunal's Statute]."<ref>[http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICTY/2004/7.html Prosecutor v. Radislav Krstic - Appeals Chamber - Judgment - IT-98-33 (2004) ICTY 7 (19 April 2004)] See Paragraph 6: "Article 4 of the Tribunal's Statute, like the Genocide Convention, covers certain acts done with "intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such."</ref><ref>[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/icty/statute.html Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991], U.N.

In paragraph 13 the judges raise the issue of the perpetrators' access to the victims: "The historical examples of genocide also suggest that the area of the perpetrators’ activity and control, as well as the possible extent of their reach, should be considered. ... The intent to destroy formed by a perpetrator of genocide will always be limited by the opportunity presented to him. While this factor alone will not indicate whether the targeted group is substantial, it can - in combination with other factors - inform the analysis."<ref name=PvRKappel />

====CPPCG coming into force====
After the minimum 20 countries became parties to the Convention, it came into force as international law on 12 January 1951. At that time however, only two of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (UNSC) were parties to the treaty: France and the Republic of China. Eventually the Soviet Union ratified in 1954, the United Kingdom in 1970, the People's Republic of China in 1983 (having replaced the Taiwan-based Republic of China on the UNSC in 1971), and the United States in 1988. This long delay in support for the Genocide Convention by the world's most powerful nations caused the Convention to languish for over four decades. Only in the 1990s did the international law on the crime of genocide begin to be enforced.

====Security Council responsibility to protect====
resolution commits the Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict.

===Under municipal law===

Since the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) came into effect in January 1951 about 80 member states of the United Nations have passed legislation that incorporates the provisions of the CPPCG into their municipal law.

==Criticisms of the CPPCG and other definitions of genocide==

Much debate about genocides revolves around the proper definition of the word "genocide." The exclusion of social and political groups as targets of genocide in the CPPCG legal definition has been criticized by some historians and sociologists, for example M. Hassan Kakar in his book ''The Soviet Invasion and the Afghan Response, 1979-1982''<ref>M. Hassan Kakar ''[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft7b69p12h&brand=eschol Afghanistan: The Soviet Invasion and the Afghan Response, 1979-1982] University of California press © 1995 The Regents of the University of California.</ref> argues that the international definition of genocide is too restricted,<ref>M.

Barbara Harff and Ted Gurr defined genocide as "the promotion and execution of policies by a state or its agents which result in the deaths of a substantial portion of a group ...[when] the victimized groups are defined primarily in terms of their communal characteristics, i.e., ethnicity, religion or nationality."<ref>[http://efchr.mcgill.ca/WhatIsGenocide_en.php?menu=2 What is Genocide?] McGill Faculty of Law (McGill University) source cites Barbara Harff and Ted Gurr ''Toward empirical theory of genocides and politicides,'' International Studies Quarterly, 37:3, 1988</ref> Harff and Gurr also differentiate between genocides and politicides by the characteristics by which members of a group are identified by the state. In genocides, the victimized groups are defined primarily in terms of their communal characteristics, i.e., ethnicity, religion or nationality. In politicides the victim groups are defined primarily in terms of their hierarchical position or political opposition to the regime and dominant groups.<ref name=HG-2>[http://science.jrank.org/pages/9496/Genocide-Origins-Evolution-Concept.html Origins and Evolution of the Concept] in the Science Encyclopedia by Net Industries. states "Politicide, as [Barbara] Harff and [Ted R.] Gurr define it, refers to the killing of groups of people who are targeted not because of shared ethnic or communal traits, but because of 'their hierarchical position or political opposition to the regime and dominant groups' (p. 360)".

According to R. J. Rummel, genocide has 3 different meanings. The ordinary meaning is murder by government of people due to their national, ethnic, racial, or religious group membership. The legal meaning of genocide refers to the international treaty, the ''Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide''. This also includes non-killings that in the end eliminate the group, such as preventing births or forcibly transferring children out of the group to another group. A generalized meaning of genocide is similar to the ordinary meaning but also includes government killings of political opponents or otherwise intentional murder. It is to avoid confusion regarding what meaning is intended that Rummel created the term democide for the third meaning.<ref>[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/GENOCIDE.HTM Domocide versus genocide; which is what?]</ref>

A major criticism of the international community's response to the Rwandan Genocide was that it was reactive, not proactive. The international community has developed a mechanism for prosecuting the perpetrators of genocide but has not developed the will or the mechanisms for intervening in a genocide as it happens. Critics point to the Darfur conflict and suggest that if anyone is found guilty of genocide after the conflict either by prosecutions brought in the International Criminal Court or in an ''ad hoc'' International Criminal Tribunal, this will confirm this perception.

==International prosecution of genocide==

===By ad hoc tribunals===
All signatories to the CPPCG are required to prevent and punish acts of genocide, both in peace and wartime, though some barriers make this enforcement difficult. In particular, some of the signatories &mdash; namely, immunity from prosecution they grant has been invoked from time to time, as when the United States refused to allow a charge of genocide brought against it by Yugoslavia following the 1999 Kosovo War.<ref>[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/Kosovo/Kosovo-International_Law10.htm (See for example the submission by Agent of the United States, Mr. David Andrews to the ICJ Public  Sitting, 11 May 1999])</ref>

It is commonly accepted that, at least since customary international law as a conventional international law. Acts of genocide are generally difficult to establish for prosecution, because a chain of accountability must be established. International criminal courts and tribunals function primarily because the states involved are incapable or unwilling to prosecute crimes of this magnitude themselves.

====Rwanda====

The genocide which occurred there during April, 1994, commencing on April 6. The ICTR was created on November 8, 1994 by the Security Council of the United Nations in order to judge those people responsible for the acts of genocide and other serious violations of the international law performed in the territory of Rwanda, or by Rwandan citizens in nearby states, between January 1 and December 31, 1994.
