'''Philostratus''', was the name of four Greek Roman imperial period:

# (c. 150-200) "Philostratus I": Very minor author, known only for a dialogue ''Nero'', possibly written by Philostratus II.
# (c. 170-247) "Philostratus II": son of Philostratus I. Also called "Philostratus the Athenian" or "Lucius Flavius Philostratus" 
# (born c. 190) "Philostratus III": the probable nephew of Philostratus II. Also called "Philostratus of Lemnos" or "Philostratus the Elder" 
# (born c. 220) "Philostratus IV": the probable grandson of Philostratus III. Also called "Philostratus of Lemnos", or "Philostratus the Younger".

==Philostratus II==
Of these the most famous is Philostratus "the Athenian". Very little is known of his career. Even his name is doubtful. The ''Lives of the Sophists'' gives the praenomen ''Flavius'', which, however, is found elsewhere only in Tyrian; his letters refer to him as an Athenian. It is probable that he was born in Lemnos, studied and taught at Athens, and then settled in Rome (where he would naturally be called ''Atheniensis'') as a member of the learned circle with which empress Julia Domna surrounded herself.

He was born probably around Tyre circa 250 AD.

There is a near consensus that Philostratus II was the author of the following four works:

* (between 217 and 238 AD) ''Life of Apollonius of Tyana'', which he wrote for Julia Domna, wife of Septimius Severus and mother of Caracalla (see Apollonius of Tyana); he completed it after her death. 
* (231-237) ''Gordians who were killed in 238. The work is divided into two parts: the first dealing with the ancient Sophists, e.g. Gorgias, the second with the later school, e.g. Herodes Atticus. The Lives are not in the true sense biographical, but rather picturesque impressions of leading representatives of an attitude of mind full of curiosity, alert and versatile, but lacking scientific method, preferring the external excellence of style and manner to the solid achievements of serious writing. The philosopher, as he says, investigates truth; the sophist embellishes it, and takes it for granted. 
* (after 220) ''Gymnasticus''. The ''Gymnasticus'' contains interesting matter concerning the Olympic games and athletic contests generally. 
* (?) ''Epistolae'' or ''Love Letters''. The Letters breathe the spirit of the New Comedy and the Alexandrine poets; portions of Letter 33 are almost literally translated in Ben Jonson's ''Song to Celia'', "Drink to me only with thine eyes." The letters are mainly of an erotic character. 

The fact that the author of the ''Life of Apollonius'' is also the author of the ''Lives of the Sophists'' is confirmed by internal evidence.  The ''Lives of the Sophists'' was to have an enormous impact upon later writers, particularly Neoplatonists.

==Philostratus III==

The works ''Heroicus'' and ''Imagines'' were traditionally attributed to Philostratus II, but are now more commonly attributed to Philostratus III.
