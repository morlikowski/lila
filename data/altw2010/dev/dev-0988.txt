Attualmente sospeso dalla NFL, è in forza agli Atlanta Falcons.

== Carriera ==
=== Esordi ===
Dopo un inizio promettente alle elementari come giocatore prima di baseball poi di basket, ha scelto di giocare a football americano durante il liceo, quando la madre gli ha consigliato di frequentare un'attività extra-curricolare per combattere le crisi adolescenziali che lo avevano portato a numerosi scontri con i suoi insegnanti.

Finito il liceo, nel 1999 si è iscritto al Virginia Tech, dove si è messo subito in luce, mettendo a segno tre touchdown in corsa in un solo quarto di gioco al suo esordio; in quella stessa partita, dopo il terzo quarto si è infortunato alla caviglia ed è stato costretto a uscire dal campo e a saltare la partita successiva. Quella stagione ha portato la sua squadra al Sugar Bowl, dove, nonostante la sconfitta contro la squadra di Florida State, Vick si mise in luce, rimontando 21 punti di distacco e guadagnando un breve vantaggio. Ha dominato la classifica NCAA relativa all'efficacia dei passaggi, stabilendo il record assoluto per una matricola (180.4) e piazzandosi al secondo posto nella relativa classifica di tutti i tempi. Vick è stato inoltre premiato come miglior giocatore universitario della nazione ed è giunto terzo nelle votazioni per il vincitore dell'Heisman Trophy.

Nonostante non giocasse a MLB dai NFL. 

=== Professionismo ===
Nel NFL, Vick è stato selezionato come prima scelta dagli Atlanta Falcons, squadra con la quale ha debuttato nella partita contro i San Francisco 49ers.

Il 4 gennaio 2003 ha trascinato i Falcons verso una vittoria per 27 a 7 contro i Green Bay Packers, ampiamente favoriti, nei playoff della National Football Conference (NFC) al Lambeau Field, ponendo fine alla loro striscia di vittorie consecutive.

Durante un'amichevole pre-campionato contro i Baltimore Ravens nell'estate del 2003, Vick si è rotto il perone ed è stato costretto a saltare buona parte della ''regular season''. Nel 2004 ha contribuito significativamente alla stagione dei Falcons con 11 vittorie e 5 sconfitte, che permise ai Falcons di passare direttamente al secondo turno dei playoff per la terza volta nella loro storia. La stagione finì con la sconfitta contro i Philadelphia Eagles nel Championship della NFC.

Vick is also under indictment for two related his role in the dogfighting ring and related gambling activity. His state trial has been delayed until he is released from federal prison. He faces a maximum 10 year state prison term if convicted on both counts.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.ajc.com/falcons/content/sports/falcons/stories/2008/05/08/vick_0508.html Vick ordered to pay bank $2.5 million | ajc.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d804ed94f&template=without-video&confirm=true Vick sentenced to 23 months in jail<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3140049 ESPN - Source says prosecutors may ask for longer sentence for Vick - NFL<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.ajc.com/braves/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/11/27/vickburst_1128.html</ref> 

== Childhood ==
Vick was the second of four children (including older sister Christina ("Niki") and younger siblings Marcus and Courtney) born in Newport News, Virginia, to Brenda Vick and Michael Boddie, then unmarried teenagers.<ref> </ref> His mother worked two jobs, obtained some public financial assistance, and had help from her parents, while his father worked long hours in the shipyards as a sandblaster and spray-painter.<ref name="Bio"></ref>  They were married when Michael was about five years old but the children elected to continue to use their "Vick" surname.

The family lived in the "Ridley Circle Homes", a East End section of the port city, an area known in hip hop culture by the slang names "Bad News" or "Bad Newz" according to the Urban Dictionary. A 2007 newspaper article published in the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted "not much changed" by observations of local people almost ten years after Michael Vick left. One resident said that there is drug dealing, drive-by shootings and other killing in the neighborhood, and suggested that sports was a way out and a dream for many.<ref name="Puzzling"></ref>

In a 2001 interview, Vick told the Newport News ''Daily Press'' that when he was 10 or 11 "I would go fishing even if the fish weren't biting, just to get out of there" and away from the violence and stress of daily life in the projects. Even though the area is, by all accounts, troubled, several people interviewed were disbelieving that dog fighting was a local activity there.<ref name="Puzzling" />

==Athletic career==
===Early amateur athletics===
During the early years of his family, Michael Boddie's employment required a lot of travel, but he taught football skills to his two sons at an early age. Michael Vick was only three years old when his father, nicknamed "Bullet" for his blinding speed during his own playing days on the gridiron, began teaching him the fundamentals. He also taught younger brother Marcus.

As he grew up, Michael Vick, who as a child went by the nickname "Ookie",<ref name="Bio" /> also learned a lot about football from a second cousin four years older, Aaron Brooks. Vick and Brooks both spent a lot of time as youths at the local Boys and Girls Club.<ref name="Bio" /><ref></ref> As a 7-year-old throwing three touchdown passes in a Boys Club league, his apparent football talents led coaches and his parents to keep a special watch over Vick.<ref name="Puzzling" />

Vick told ''Sporting News'' magazine in an interview published April 9, 2001: "Sports kept me off the streets.... It kept me from getting into what was going on, the bad stuff. Lots of guys I knew have had bad problems."

===High school===
Vick first came to prominence while at Warwick High School, also in Newport News.

At Warwick High School, under Coach Reamon's tutelage, Vick was a three-year starter for the Raiders, passing for 4,846 yards with 43 touchdowns during his career. He once ran for six touchdowns and threw for three touchdowns in a single game. He also added 1,048 yards and 18 scores on the ground and accounted for ten passing and ten rushing touchdowns as a senior as he passed for 1,668 yards.

Coach Reamon, who had helped guide Aaron Brooks from Newport News to the redshirt him and provide the freshman needed time to develop. Reamon sold Michael on the school's proximity to family and friends<ref name="Bio" />, and apparently following his advice, Vick chose to attend Virginia Tech and play football as a Hokie.

As he left the Newport News public housing projects in 1998, "on the wings of a college football scholarship," Michael Vick was seen in the Newport News (and close-by Hampton) community of the lower Virginia Peninsula as a "success story."<ref name="Puzzling" /> In a story published in September 2000, while his son Michael was at Virginia Tech, Michael Boddie told the university's ''Collegiate Times'': "Ever since he learned to throw a football, he's always liked throwing a ball...It's just in his blood." He added that his son had never gotten into trouble or ... involved with drugs, adding: "I like the way he has developed, not only as a player but as a person."<ref name=autogenerated3></ref>

===College career===
After high school, Michael Vick attended Virginia Tech. In his first collegiate game as a redshirt freshman against James Madison in 1999, he scored three rushing Hokies to an 11–0 season and to the Florida State. Although Virginia Tech lost 46–29, Vick was able to bring the team back from a 21 point deficit to take a brief lead. During the season, Vick appeared on the cover of an ''ESPN The Magazine'' issue.

Vick led the NCAA in 2006 season at Joe Hamilton. Vick's third-place finish matched the highest finish ever by a freshman up to that point, first set by Adrian Peterson has since broken that mark, finishing second in 2004).

Vick's 2000 season did have its share of highlights, such as his career rushing high of 210 yards against the West Virginia in the Black Diamond Trophy game, Vick accounted for 288 total yards of offense and two touchdowns in a 48–20 win.  The following week, Vick led the Hokies back from a 14–0 deficit against  at the Carrier Dome—where the Hokies had not won since 1986.  Vick put the game away with a 55-yard run with 1:34 left.<ref></ref>

The following game against , Vick was injured and had to miss the rest of that game, the entire game against , and was unable to start against the —the Hokies' lone loss of the season.  Vick's final game at Virginia Tech came against the  in the Toyota Gator Bowl, where he was named MVP of the game.

With the opportunity and huge financial benefits as an option, Vick elected to leave Virginia Tech after his redshirt sophomore season to become a professional football player. Aware that the rest of his family was still living in their 3 bedroom apartment in the Ridley Circle Homes, Michael Vick stated that he was going to buy his mother "a home and a car.

===Professional career===
====NFL Draft====
thumb|Vick scans the field against the [[New Orleans Saints|Saints]]
Vick was selected in the CB KR league MVP in 2006 (although Vick has never become league MVP, he finished second in voting in 2004).<ref></ref> In this way, Tomlinson and Vick are linked as having been "traded" for each other, although the transaction was actually the result of traded draft picks and contract negotiations.

====Early NFL career====
Vick made his NFL debut at San Francisco on September 9, 2001 and saw limited action. He completed his first NFL pass with an 18-yard strike to WR Tony Martin in the second quarter vs. Carolina on September 23 and first NFL touchdown on a two-yard rushing score in the fourth quarter to help the Falcons to a 24–16 victory. Vick made his first career start at Dallas on November 11 and threw the first touchdown pass of his career on a nine-yard toss to TE St. Louis on January 6, 2002. He also rushed 29 times for 289 yards (9.9 avg.) and one touchdown.

In 2002, Vick became a bona fide star and MVP candidate in his first season as a full-time starter at the age of 22. He was named to his first Pittsburgh on November 10, as well as passing yards with 337 vs. Detroit on December 22. He also completed a career-long 74 yards for a touchdown to WR Minnesota on December 1. Vick also tied for third in team history for the lowest interception percentage in a season at 1.90 and continued a streak of consecutive passes without an interception that began at St. Louis on January 6, 2002 in the season-finale of the 2001 season and extended to the first quarter vs. Baltimore on November 3, 2002. His streak covered 25 straight quarters and 177 passes without an interception. On January 1, 2003, Vick led the Atlanta Falcons to an upset victory over the heavily favored NFC playoffs, ending the Packers' undefeated playoff record at Lambeau Field. The Falcons would later lose 20–6 to the Donovan McNabb-led Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC divisional playoff game.

====2003–2006 seasons ====
During a pre-season game against the Baltimore Ravens on August 16, Vick suffered a fractured right Doug Johnson in the third quarter at Houston on November 30, completing 8 of 11 passes for 60 yards and recording 16 rushing yards on three carries. He posted his first start of the season vs. Carolina on Tampa Bay completing 8 of 15 passes for 119 yards and two touchdowns for a passer rating of 119.2. Vick closed out the season with a 21–14 victory vs. Jacksonville on December 28, where he completed 12 of 22 passes for 180 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. Ending the season starting four of five games played, Vick completed 50 of 100 passes for 585 yards with four touchdowns and three interceptions and also rushing 40 times for 255 yards and one touchdown while guiding the Falcons to a 3–1 record in the final four weeks of action.

In 2004, Vick was named to his second Pro Bowl after starting all 15 games played and completing 181 of 321 passes for 2,313 yards with 14 touchdowns and 12 interceptions while he also posted career-highs with 120 carries for 902 yards along with three rushing touchdowns. The 902 rushing yards with a 7.52 average per carry ranked third and second, respectively, in NFL annals for quarterbacks. Vick was also named NFC Offensive Player of the Week on two separate occasions during the season, one for his performance at Denver on October 31 when he became the first quarterback to throw for more than 250 yards and rush for over 100 yards in the same game. He led the team to an 11–4 record, which was the third-best record for a starting quarterback in team history behind NFC title game 27–10.

On December 23, 2004, Vick signed a 10-year contract with the Atlanta Falcons worth $130 million with a $37 million signing bonus, making him the highest paid player in NFL history at that time and one of the highest paid ever in sports.<ref></ref> Vick's deal surpasses the $98 million contract the Indianapolis Colts' Peyton Manning signed in March 2005. Manning, who signed for seven years, is guaranteed $34.5 million in bonuses. Vick's $130 million potential value tops Philadelphia's Donovan McNabb's 12-year, $115 million deal that runs through 2013.

In 2005, Vick was named to his third Pro Bowl after starting all 15 games played and completing 214 of 387 passes for 2,412 yards with 15 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. His 597 rushing yards on 102 carries (5.9 avg.) with six scores led all NFL quarterbacks and his 5.9 average yards per carry led all NFL rushers with at least 100 carries. Vick also helped three players have career years in RB Michael Jenkins.

On October 22, 2006, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Vick had his first game in which he threw three or more touchdowns. After three quarters, Vick had four touchdowns, three of which went to Alge Crumpler. The following week against the Kansas City's Larry Johnson (49). However, he had several incidents during the 2006 season, such as the obscene gesture incident, which ruined his sixth season in the league. In fact, he was denied a selection to the Pro Bowl, which would have been his third straight and fourth overall.

Only Steve Young have more rushing yards at the quarterback position than Vick. He is also first among QB's all-time in rushing yards per game, at 53.5 yards per game. Vick also holds several NFL quarterback rushing records, including most rushing yards in one game (173), most 100-yard rushing games (7), and most rushing yards in a single season (1,039).

====Possible future with the NFL====
The prospects of Vick returning to play professional football were the subject of much conjecture after his suspension. The most serious obstacles are clearly the length of imprisonment and possible impact of probationary restrictions afterward. Assuming he gets time off for good behavior, Vick's earliest release date would be between May and October 2009, according to one of his attorneys. That would make his return to play possible as soon as the 2009 season if all other factors were favorable. <ref name = "ajc-vicfuture"> http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/12/10/vickfuture_1211.html</ref> Missing two full seasons and the physical regimen is a serious disruption in a career, but it is not impossible that he could successfully return to play at that point. However, it is likely that teams considering him at that time will want to look at Vick at other positions. "I am not sure they would bring him back as a quarterback", stated one senior NFL analyst. 

However, the May–October 2009 estimate is based upon assuming that Virginia does not impose any additional prison time even if he is convicted of one or both of the still-pending felony counts when he is tried in Surry Circuit Court on June 27, 2008 on charges that could theoretically result in an additional ten years in state prison in addition to his federal sentence.<ref>[http://www.dailyprogress.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=CDP%2FMGArticle%2FCDP_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1173353817665&path=!news DailyProgress.com | 23-month term not end for Vick<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Any additional prison time added by Virginia, of which a maximum of ten years is possible, which would lengthen his time away from the NFL would substantially reduce the likelihood of a successful return, even in a different position than as quarterback. In the most extreme case of a maximum sentence (terms served consecutively), Vick would be as old as 38 when released, since Virginia laws, like federal law, only allow for a maximum of 15% of the sentence to be shaved off for good behavior.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&id=3148767 ESPN - Sentence puts Vick's NFL career in jeopardy - NFL<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Even without these factors to consider, it is possible that few general managers would be willing to offer Vick another chance in the NFL, out of fear of a public relations backlash. ESPN's John Clayton said that only a few entrenched general managers would be willing to take such a risk, and even then few owners would sign off on it. Also of note is that Vick would likely not be welcome in the Canadian Football League, as it is nearly impossible for a convicted felon (or one convicted of a crime that would be treated as an indictable offence in Canada) to get a Canadian temporary resident permit. Clayton did speculate that Vick would most likely play in the Arena Football League. In a interview on April 2, 2008 with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Falcon's owner Arthur Blank, stated he would like to see Michael play in the NFL again. He also stated he would not rule out welcoming Michael Vick back to the team.

====Suspension by the NFL====
Hours after Vick pled guilty in the Bad Newz Kennels dogfighting investigation, the NFL suspended Vick indefinitely without pay. In a letter to Vick, Commissioner Roger Goodell said that Vick had admitted to conduct that was "not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible."  While Vick is technically a first-time offender under the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy, Goodell handed down a harsher suspension because Vick admitted that he provided most of the money for the gambling side of the operation. The NFL does not allow its players to be involved in any form of gambling, and even first-time offenders risk being banned for life. However, Goodell did leave open the possibility of reinstating Vick depending on how well he cooperates with federal and state authorities.<ref> </ref>

Earlier, Goodell had barred Vick from reporting to training camp while the league conducted its own investigation into the matter. Any chance of Vick playing a down in the NFL in 2007 were all but wiped out at his July 26 arraignment, as the terms of his bail barred him from leaving Virginia for any reason before the trial.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2965298 ESPN - SCLC will not recognize Vick at Atlanta convention - NFL<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On August 27, Falcons owner Arthur Blank said in a press conference that the Falcons would seek to recover a portion of Vick's signing bonus. He also said the team had no immediate plans to cut ties with Vick, citing salary-cap issues.<ref> </ref>  It initially appeared that Goodell had cleared the way for the Falcons to release Vick, since he ruled that Vick's involvement in gambling activity breached his contract. On August 29, the Falcons sent a letter to Vick demanding that he reimburse them for $20 million of the $37 million bonus.<ref> </ref> The case was sent to arbitration, and on October 10, an arbitrator ruled that Vick had to reimburse the Falcons for $19.97 million. The arbitrator agreed with the Falcons' contentions that Vick knew he was engaging in illegal activity when he signed his new contract in 2004, and that he'd even used the bonus money to pay for the operation.<ref> </ref>

==Personal==
===Controversies and incidents===
Between his selection by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2001 NFL Draft and early 2007, Vick was allegedly involved several incidents or events:

*In 2007, conflicting statements were made by his estranged parents about possible dogfighting activities in 2001. Michael Boddie, his father, who now lives in Atlanta, told the ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' that around 2001, Michael Vick was staging dogfights in the garage of the family's home in Newport News and kept fighting dogs in the family's backyard, including injured ones which the father nursed back to health. Boddie said his son had been urged to not engage in the activity, but continued. He stated "This is Mike's thing. And he knows it." <ref name="vickdaddailypress"></ref> Within days, Michael Vick's mother, Brenda Vick Boddie, who now lives in Suffolk, Virginia, responded. She told the ''Newport News Daily Press'' "There was no dogfighting [at our home]. There were no cages."<ref> </ref>

*In early 2004, two men were arrested in Virginia for distributing marijuana. The truck they were driving was registered to Michael Vick. The Falcons coach Dan Reeves recalled that he lectured Vick at that time on the importance of reputation, on choosing the right friends, on staying out of trouble for the good of his team. The ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' quoted Reeves as having told Vick: "You are an Atlanta Falcon...Whatever you do is going to be a reflection on all of us, not just you."<ref name="ajcvickbio"></ref>

*On October 10, 2004, Vick and the other members of his party including employee Quanis Phillips were at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport on their way to board an AirTran afternoon flight to Newport News, Virginia. While they were passing through a security checkpoint with Vick, a security camera caught Phillips and Todd Harris picking up an expensive-appearing watch (either a Rolex or a fake) which belonged to Alvin Spencer, a security screener.<ref name="washingtonpostairport"></ref> After watching the theft on a video tape, Spencer filed a police report. However, he claimed that Billy "White Shoes" Johnson, known as the Falcons "fixer", interfered with the investigation.<ref name="ajcvickbio" /> Although Vick representatives declined to make him available for an Atlanta police inquiry, six days later Spencer did get the watch back from them, according to the ''Washington Post''.<ref name="washingtonpostairport" />

* In March 2005 a woman named Sonya Elliott filed a civil lawsuit against Vick alleging she contracted genital herpes from Vick, in the autumn of 2002, and that he failed to inform her that he had the disease.<ref></ref> Elliot further alleged that Vick had visited clinics under the alias "Ron Mexico" to get treatments and thus he knew of his condition. On April 24, 2006 Vick's attorney, Lawrence Woodward, revealed that the lawsuit had settled out of court with an undisclosed amount.<ref></ref> Many fans bought custom jerseys from NFL.com with Vick's number 7 and the name "MEXICO" on the back, as a reference to his lawsuit. The NFL has since banned customizing jerseys with the name Mexico.<ref>On the NFL Shop custom jersey website (http://www.nflshop.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1772598) Entering the Term "MEXICO" onto the jersey returns with the message "Your current entry cannot be processed. Language deemed inappropriate, derogatory, or profane will not be accepted. Please create a new entry." The same message is returned when trying to create a custom jersey with "VICK" on the back. However, a "RON MEXICO" or Michael Vick Jersey can still be made at other sites, such as http://www.onthefield.com/atlantafalcons.html</ref>

* November 20, 2006 – Vick and the City of Kankakee, Illinois enter into an agreement that permits Vick to pay sales taxes to Kankakee and not in Georgia or Virginia.<ref>http://www.ci.kankakee.il.us/council%20meetings%20and%20minutes/11–20–06%5b1%5d.MIN.rtf</ref>

* November 26, 2006 – After a Falcons loss to the New Orleans Saints in the obscene gesture at fans, holding up two middle fingers. He was fined $10,000 by the NFL for his obscene gesture, and agreed to donate another $10,000 to charity.<ref></ref>

* January 17, 2007 – Vick surrendered a water bottle which had a hidden compartment to security personnel at Miami International Airport. "The compartment was hidden by the bottle's label so that it appeared to be a full bottle of water when held upright," police said. Test results indicated there were no illegal substances in the water bottle and Vick was cleared of any wrongdoing.<ref></ref> Vick announced that the water bottle was a jewelry stash box, and that the substance in question had been jewelry.<ref>  </ref>

* November 3, 2001 – Fans in the family section of the stands cheered when Atlanta Falcon's quarterback Chris Chandler was injured because it meant that Vick would be given a chance to play.  Chris Chandler's wife Diane confronted the fans, which led to a commotion which led to an object being thrown. Coach Dan Reeves said that he would speak with the players about how their families were expected to act following the game. Vick himself decried the incident:  "That's so crazy, man," Vick said. "I don't see how anybody could be cheering while somebody's out there getting hit. As hard as we go out there and try to please these fans, as hard as we go out and play, I don't see why anybody would even make those statements."<ref> </ref><ref> </ref>

===Dog fighting investigations===

Beginning on dog fighting activities at a property owned by Vick in a rural county in southeastern Virginia.<ref name="ajcvickbio" /> Vick was indicted on and eventually pled guilty to federal dog fighting charges, and was accused of financing the operation, directly participating in dog fights and executions, and personally handling thousands of dollars in related gambling activities.
