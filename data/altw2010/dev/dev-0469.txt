thumb|right|Howard Dean, le [[23 juin 2003.]]

'''Howard Brush Dean III''' (né le américain, actuellement au poste de chef du comité national du parti démocrate (DNC). Il a été gouverneur du Vermont de 1991 à 2003.

Issu d'une famille aisée de New-York il étudia à Yale où il obtient une licence de sciences-politiques . 

Dean est surtout connu pour sa candidature aux primaires démocrates de l'élection présidentielle américaine de 2004, dont il fut le favori avant le début des différents débats. Alors qu'il était généralement vu comme un centriste pragmatique pendant son mandat de gouverneur, Dean a surpris en faisant campagne sur l'aile gauche du parti démocrate. Il critiqua la politique du président en poste George W. Bush (en particulier sur sa décision d'intervenir militairement en Irak), ainsi que les démocrates pour ne pas avoir réussi à s'opposer à l'administration Bush. Ce message, ainsi qu'une utilisation originale d'Internet, lui ont permis de se constituer un cœur de militants dévoués, qui lui restèrent fidèles même après l'échec de sa candidature.

Sa popularité tomba lorsqu'il fit, haletant, un discours surexcité qu'il conclut en criant ''"Yeahhhhhh!!!!"''.

<!--Please See naming conventions at WP:MOSBIO, do not add details like "Dr." or "MD"-->'''Howard Brush Dean III''', (born American politician and Democratic Party at the national level. Before entering politics, Dean received his medical degree from the Democrat in 1982 and was elected Vermont history, after pregnant women in the state.

An early 2004 Democratic Presidential nomination, Dean denounced the Bush Administration.  Dean showed strong Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. Dean formed the organization Democracy for America and later was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee in February 2005.

==Early life and education==
===East Hampton and New York City childhood===
Dean was born in East Hampton, New York, to Howard Brush Dean, Jr. and Andrée Belden Maitland, an art appraiser.<ref name="coolpassion"></ref> He is the oldest of their four children, all boys.<ref name="coolpassion" />

Howard's father worked at Dean Witter; the family was quite wealthy, Republican, and belonged to the exclusive East Hampton. As a child he spent much of his time growing up in East Hampton; the family built a house on Hook Pond<ref>[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=east+hampton,+ny&ll=40.953585,-72.176056&spn=0.035264,0.097504 East Hampton, NY]</ref> there in the mid-1950s. There the boys — Howard, Charlie, Jim and Bill — "rode bikes, played with a model train set, [and] built elaborate underground forts." While in New York, the family had a three-bedroom apartment on the Park Avenue, where Dean still sometimes stays.<ref name="coolpassion"/>

Howard attended the St. George's School, a preparatory school in Middletown, Rhode Island.<ref>Grove, Lloyd. "Dean looks back, dryly." November 2, 2003.<sup>[http://web.archive.org/web/20031104221724/http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/133177p-118729c.html]</sup></ref>
In September 1966, he attended Felsted School, UK for one school year after winning an English Speaking Union scholarship.<ref>Peek, Laura and Reid, Tim. "The house prefect who would be President. Democrat hopeful remembers 'cruel' English public school", ''The Times'', December 3, 2003.<sup>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1036747.ece]</sup></ref>

Political opponents have been reluctant to seize upon Dean's privileged early life. Wall Street Journal'' that "he doesn't seem like a WASP. I know it's not nice to deal in George Bush, the elder, for that matter, in Mr. Dean...He seems unpolished, doesn't hide his aggression, is proudly pugnacious. He doesn't look or act the part of the WASP...It will be harder for Republicans to tag Mr. Dean as Son of the Greenwich Country Day. He just doesn't act the part."<ref>Noonan, Peggy. "The Dean Disappointment." ''The Wall Street Journal''. January 8, 2004.<sup>[http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110004522]</sup></ref>

===The Yale years===
Dean attended African-American. The university housing office complied and Dean roomed with two Southern black students and one white student from Charleston, South Carolina and today a New York City labor lawyer. Dawson said of Dean:
<blockquote>Unless you operated from a stereotypic understanding of the Yale white boy as rich, you wouldn't know that about Howard...When it came to race — and I don't know whether this was a function of intent or just came naturally — Howard was not patronizing in any way. He was willing to confront in discussion what a lot of white students weren't. He would hold his ground. He would respect that I knew forty-two million times more about being black than he did. But that didn't mean he couldn't hold a view on something relating to civil rights that would be as valid as mine. There were lots of well-meaning people at Yale who wanted you to understand that they understood your plight; you'd get into a conversation and they would yield too soon, so we didn't get the full benefit of the exchange. Howard very much thought he was capable of working an issue through. He was inquisitive. And when he came to a conclusion he would be as strong as anybody else. I don't think he's stubborn. He's a guy who's always been comfortable in his own skin. That's something you still see in him today, and it gets him into some degree of controversy.</blockquote><ref>{{cite news

At Yale, Dean was a member of the fraternity. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1971.

Though eventually eligible to be drafted into the military, he received a deferment for an unfused vertebra.He briefly tried a career as a Charlie, who had been traveling through Laotian guerrillas, a tragedy widely reported to have an enormous influence in Dean's life; he wore his brother's belt every day of his presidential campaign.

===The move to Vermont as a doctor===
Dean received his medical degree from the Judith Steinberg, whom he met in Burlington, Vermont (where she continued to use her maiden name to avoid confusion).

==Personal life==
Dean has kept an unusually strict separation between his political career and his personal life. His wife, who has continued practicing medicine, mostly stayed out of the limelight during his presidential campaign, giving few interviews and not traveling with her husband on the campaign trail until the final days in First Lady. She had shunned the limelight of the campaign until Dean's later much-publicized "scream" gaffe. Dean brought her out for a lengthy sit-down network interview, where she dismissed the "scream" as silly.

Though he was raised an Episcopalian, Dean joined the United Church of Christ in 1982 after a dispute with the local Episcopal diocese over a bike trail (see below). By his own account, he does not attend church "very often"; at one point, when asked to name his favorite book in the New Testament, he offered the Old Testament Book of Job, then corrected himself an hour later.<ref>{{cite news

A personal finance statement filed for his presidential campaign put the couple's net worth between US$2.2 and $5 million.

==Vermont political career==
In 1980, Dean spearheaded a (successful) grassroots campaign to stop a condominium development on Lake Champlain, instead favoring the construction of a bicycle trail. The effort succeeded, and helped launch his political career. That same year, he was also a volunteer for Jimmy Carter's re-election campaign. In 1982, he was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives, where he remained until being elected lieutenant governor in 1986. Both were part-time positions which enabled him to continue practicing medicine.

On August 14, 1991, Dean was examining a patient when he received word that then-Governor Richard A. Snelling had died of a heart attack while Snelling was cleaning his own swimming pool. Dean assumed the office, which he called the "greatest job in Vermont." He was subsequently elected to five two-year terms in his own right, making him the second longest-serving governor in Vermont's history. From 1994 to 1995, Dean was the chairman of the National Governors Association.

Dean was faced with an economic recession and a $60 million budget deficit. He bucked many in his own party to immediately push for a balanced budget (Vermont is the only state whose constitution does not require one), an act which marked the beginning of a record of fiscal restraint. During his tenure as governor, the state paid off much of its debt, balanced its budget eleven times, raised its bond rating, and lowered income taxes twice.

Dean also focused on health care issues, most notably through the "Dr. Dynasaur" program, which ensures near-universal health coverage for children and pregnant women in the state; the uninsured rate in Vermont dropped from 12.7% to 9.6% under his watch. Child abuse and teen pregnancy rates were cut roughly in half.<ref>http://www.preventchildabuse.org/publications/lookin_up/downloads/fall02.pdf</ref>

By far the most controversial decision of his career, and the first to draw serious national attention came in 2000, when the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that the state's marriage laws unconstitutionally excluded same-sex couples and ordered that the state legislature either allow gays and lesbians to marry or create a parallel status. Facing calls to amend the state constitution to prohibit either option, Dean chose to support the latter one, and signed the nation's first civil unions legislation into law, spurring a short-lived "Take Back Vermont" movement which helped Republicans gain control of the State House.

Dean would receive some criticism during his 2004 presidential campaign for another decision related to civil unions. Shortly before leaving office, he had some of his Vermont papers sealed for at least the next decade, a timeframe longer than most outgoing governors use. He claimed he was protecting the privacy of many gay supporters who sent him personal letters about the issue. On the campaign trail, he demanded that Vice President Dick Cheney release his energy committee papers. Many people, including then-Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who left the party after losing his primary for re-election in 2006, accused Dean of hypocrisy. Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit to force the papers be opened before the seal expired, but lost.

As governor, Dean was endorsed by the National Rifle Association several times, furthering his moderate image; though he is not a member of the NRA.

==2004 presidential candidacy==
thumb|300px|Howard Dean declared his candidacy for the 2004 Democratic Party presidential nomination on June 23, 2003, in Burlington, Vermont

Dean began his bid for President as a "long shot" candidate. ''speech at the California State Democratic Convention that attracted the attention of grassroots party activists and set the tone and the agenda of his candidacy. It began with the line: "What I want to know is what in the world so many Democrats are doing supporting the President's unilateral intervention in Iraq?"<ref>http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Howard_Dean's_speech_of_March_15,_2003</ref>

That summer, his campaign was featured as the cover article in ''The New Republic'' and in the following months he received expanded media attention. His campaign slowly gained steam, and by autumn of 2003, Dean had become the apparent frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, performing strongly in most polls and outpacing his rivals in fundraising. This latter feat was attributed mainly to his innovative embrace of the Internet for campaigning, and the majority of his donations came from individual Dean supporters, who came to be known as ''Deanites'', or, more commonly, ''Deaniacs''. (Critics often labeled them "Deany Boppers", or "Deanie Babies", a reference to his support from young activists.)

During his presidential campaign, conservative critics labeled Dean's political views as those of an extreme liberal; however, in liberal Vermont, Dean, long known as a staunch advocate of fiscal restraint, was regarded as a moderate. Many left-wing critics who supported fellow Democrat Dennis Kucinich or independent Ralph Nader charged that, at heart, Dean was a "Rockefeller Republican" — socially liberal, while fiscally conservative.
===Message and themes===
Dean began his campaign by emphasizing health care and fiscal responsibility, and championing grassroots fundraising as a way to fight U.S. plan to invade Iraq (and his forceful criticism of Democrats in Congress who voted to authorize the use of force) quickly eclipsed other issues. By challenging the war in Iraq at a time when mainstream Democratic leaders were either neutral or cautiously supportive, Dean positioned himself to appeal to his party's activist base. Dean often quoted the late Minnesota Senator Republicans. Thus, Dean also succeeded in differentiating himself from his primary opponents.

Dean's approach organizationally was also novel. His campaign made extensive use of the Internet, pioneering techniques that were subsequently adopted by politicians of all political persuasions. His supporters organized real-world meetings, many of them arranged through counties, but he lacked the campaign infrastructure to get voters to the polls that his opponents had.

===Fundraising===
thumb|150px|The popular Dean for America bat was regularly featured on the site challenging supporters to break fundraising records.

In the "invisible primary" of raising campaign dollars, Howard Dean led the Democratic pack in the early stages of the 2004 campaign. Among the candidates, he ranked first in total raised ($25.4 million as of September 30, 2003) and first in cash-on-hand ($12.4 million). However, even this performance paled next to that of George W. Bush, who by that date had raised $84.6 million for the Republican primary campaign, in which he had no real challenger. Prior to the 2004 primary season, the Democratic record for most money raised in one quarter by a primary candidate was held by Bill Clinton in 1995, raising $10.3 million during a campaign in which he had no primary opponent. In the third quarter of 2003, the Dean campaign raised $14.8 million, shattering Clinton's record. All told, Dean's campaign raised around $50 million.

While presidential campaigns have traditionally obtained finance by tapping wealthy, established political donors, Dean's funds came largely in small donations over the Internet; the average overall donation size was just under $80. This method of fundraising offered several important advantages over traditional fundraising, in addition to the inherent media interest in what was then a novelty. First, raising money on the Internet was relatively inexpensive, compared to conventional methods such as events, telemarketing, and direct mail campaigns. Secondly, as donors on average contributed far less than the legal limit ($2,000 per individual), the campaign could continue to resolicit them throughout the election season.

Dean's director of grassroots fundraising, Larry Biddle, came up with the idea of the popular fundraising "bat", an image of a cartoon baseball player and bat which appeared on the site every time the campaign launched a fundraising challenge. The bat encouraged Web site visitors to contribute money immediately through their credit cards. This would lead to the bat filling up like a thermometer with the red color indicating the total funds. The site often took suggestions from the netroots on their blog. One of these suggestions led to one of the campaigns biggest accomplishments — an image of Dean eating a turkey sandwich encouraged supporters to donate $250,000 in three days to match a big-donor dinner by Vice President Dick Cheney. The online contributions from that day matched what Cheney made from his fundraiser.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/2003.html Wired 13.08: The Candidate: Howard Dean<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In November 2003, after a much-publicized online vote among his followers, Dean became the first Democrat to forgo federal matching funds (and the spending limits that go with them) since the system was established in 1974. (John Kerry later followed his lead.) In addition to state-by-state spending limits for the primaries, the system limits a candidate to spending only $44.6 million until the Democratic National Convention in July, which sum would almost certainly run out soon after the early primary season. (George W. Bush declined federal matching funds in 2000 and did so again for the 2004 campaign.)

In a sign that the Dean campaign was starting to think beyond the primaries, they began in late 2003 to speak of a "$100 revolution" in which 2 million Americans would give $100 in order to compete with Bush.

Political commentators have claimed that the fundraising of presidential candidate Barack Obama, with its emphasis on small donors and the internet, has refined and built upon on the model that Dean's campaign pioneered.<ref>{{cite news

===Endorsements===
Though Dean lagged in early endorsements, he acquired many critical ones as his campaign snowballed. By the time of the Iowa caucuses, he led among commitments from superdelegates — elected officials and party officers entitled to convention votes by virtue of their positions. On November 12, 2003, he received the endorsements of the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Dean received the endorsement of former Vice President and presidential candidate Al Gore, on December 9, 2003. <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/12/09/elec04.prez.gore.dean/ Al Gore endorses Howard Dean]</ref> In the following weeks Dean was endorsed by former U.S. senators Bill Bradley and Carol Moseley Braun, unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidates from the 2000 and 2004 primaries, respectively.

Other high-profile endorsers included:<ref>Politics 1, [http://www.politics1.com/dean.htm ''"Howard Dean Profile"''], page archived in 2004. Retrieved November 27, 2006</ref>
* Governors (and former Governors) Bruce Babbitt, Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., Jim McGreevey, Toney Anaya, Ann Richards

* Baltimore Mayor (and current governor of Maryland) Martin J. O'Malley
* Dean also won the backing of lesser-known political figures, such as former Indiana State Senator and 1984 gubernatorial nominee Wayne Townsend.

Several celebrities from the entertainment industry also endorsed him, including Martin Sheen, Rob Reiner, Susan Sarandon, Paul Newman, Robin Williams<ref>{{cite web

====Response====
Many pundits would blame such endorsements for the campaign's eventual collapse. In particular, Al Gore's early endorsement of Dean weeks before the first primary of the election cycle was severely criticized by eight Democratic contenders particularly since he did not endorse his former running mate, Joe Lieberman.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/12/09/elec04.prez.debate.ap/index.html Gore's endorsement stirs debate]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/12/opinion/main588307.shtml Why Al Gore Really Endorsed Howard Dean]</ref> Gore supported Dean over Lieberman due to their differing opinions on Iraq which began to develop around 2002 (Lieberman supported the war and Gore did not).<ref>[http://www.observer.com/2008/look-whos-back-its-gore-and-lieberman-08 Look Who's Back: It's Gore and Lieberman in '08]</ref> When Dean's campaign failed, some attributed Gore's early endorsement.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2004/02/62225 Trippi: Net Politics Here to Stay]</ref>

===Iowa results and the "Dean Scream"===
On primary season. Dean had been a strong contender for weeks in advance in that state, battling with Dick Gephardt for first place in the polls; Gephardt finished fourth. Since Dean had spent months leading Iowa tracking polls, his third-place finish was widely considered a sign that the campaign was losing momentum. Experts attributed Dean's fall in Iowa to a number of factors, including a disorganized ground operation, a bitter fight with Dick Gephardt's campaign, and negative media attention culminating in an unearthed years-old television clip of Dean severely criticizing the caucus process that was widely broadcast in Iowa shortly before the caucus was held.

Dean, who had been suffering with a severe bout of the flu for several days, attended a post-caucus rally for his volunteers at the Val-Air Ballroom in West Des Moines, Iowa and delivered his concession speech, aimed at cheering up those in attendance. Dean was shouting over the cheers of his enthusiastic audience, but the crowd noise was being filtered out by his unidirectional microphone, leaving only his full-throated exhortations audible to the television viewers. To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice out of sheer emotion.  Additionally, Dean began his speech with a flushed-red face, clenching his teeth as he rolled up his sleeves.<ref name="CBS040126">{{cite news

|date=January 26, 2004
|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>

According to a ''Newsday'' Editorial written by Verne Gay, some members of the television audience criticized the speech as loud, peculiar, and unpresidential.<ref>Verne Gay, Seattle Times, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001840708_deantv21.html ''"Dean's theatrics draw mixed reviews"''], January 21, 2004. Retrieved November 27, 2006</ref> In particular, this quote from the speech was aired repeatedly in the days following the caucus:

<blockquote>Not only are we going to New Hampshire, Tom Harkin, we're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico, and we're going to California and Texas and New York ... And we're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan, and then we're going to Washington, D.C., to take back the White House! Yeah!</blockquote>

Senator Harkin was on stage with Dean, holding his suit jacket.  This final "Yeah!", with its unusual tone that Dean later said was due to the cracking of his hoarse voice,<ref name="bbcscream"></ref> has become known in American political jargon as the "Dean Scream".<ref name="usatodayscream"></ref><ref name="bbcscream" />
