'''Chanel № 5''' ist ein Parfüm von Coco Chanel.

=== Geschichte ===
Um ihre erste Parfümmarke zu entwerfen, wandte sich Coco Chanel an den Hofparfümeur der russischen Zaren, Mairose sind Träger der Duftnote. Jeder Goldschlägerhäutchen luftdicht versiegelt.

Unter anderem durch Marilyn Monroes berühmte Aussage „''zum Schlafen trage ich nur einige Tropfen Chanel No. 5''“ (1954) blieb der Erfolg dieses Duftes bis heute ungebrochen. Der klassisch schöne schlichte Flakon wurde 1959 in die Dauerausstellung des Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City aufgenommen. Die Fabrikation und der Verkauf von Chanels Parfüms wurden bald Pierre Wertheimer, dem Besitzer des Hauses Bourjois übertragen. Zwischen 1920 und 1930 lancierte Chanel weitere Düfte, darunter „Chanel No. 22“ im Jahr 1922 und „Cuir de Russie“ (1924), „Gardenia“ (1925), „Bois des Îles“ (1926). 

Vermutlich aufgrund der Schließung von Chanel während und nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg wurden über Jahre hinweg keine neuen Düfte mehr auf den Markt gebracht. Erst 1970, zum 87. Geburtstag von Coco Chanel, kam der Damenduft „Chanel No. 19“ von Henri Robert auf den Markt, 1974 folgte „Cristalle“.

'''Chanel No. 5''' is one of the best known couturier, Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel.

==History==
According to one story of the creation of Chanel No. 5, Coco Chanel commissioned the renowned perfumer Ernest Beaux to make ''six'' perfumes for her choosing. They were labelled No. 1, No. 2, etc. through No. 6. (Breaux himself, q.v., relates a slightly different version of the story). It was bottle No. 5 that was to Chanel's liking and became the chosen formula. The number "5" was also her lucky number. 

At the time of its inception, the most expensive perfume oil was jasmine due to the expensive distilling process. Chanel wanted to create the most expensive perfume in the world, and as such No. 5 relies heavily on jasmine.

Chanel introduced it first to some of her friends on May 5, 1921. Initially, it was given to preferred clients for free at her boutique. The fitting rooms in her boutique were also scented with No. 5.  This is still practiced today by retailer Abercrombie & Fitch. 

In 1924, Wertheimer family still runs the perfume business.

==Style==
"I want to give women an artificial perfume," said Chanel. "Yes, I really do mean artificial, like a dress, something that has been made. I don't want any rose or lily of the valley, I want a perfume that is a composition." <ref>[http://www.perfume-matters.com/chanel-perfume.php Classic Elegance: Chanel Perfume<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
No. 5 is famous for being the first perfume to heavily rely on synthetic floral top note. Before synthetics, perfume either had to be applied heavily or frequently so that the fragrance would last.

Chanel applied the French aesthetic theory that "ugly" placed next to "beautiful", by contrast, makes the beautiful object appear more so. In this era almost all perfumes were floral and "pretty" - designed to enhance a woman's beauty with more beauty. Instead of the scent of flowers, Coco wanted a perfume that "reflects my personality, something abstract and unique". She believed that a perfume should serve to spotlight a woman's natural beauty using contrast - i.e. the artificial perfume would make the woman's natural beauty more evident.

==Notes==
Chanel No. 5 is classified as a floral-aldehyde. Its top notes include ylang ylang, neroli and aldehydes; its mid notes May rose and jasmine; and its base notes sandalwood, vetiver and vanilla.<ref>See "The story of No. 5" at http://www.chanel.com Chanel's website</ref>

One of the perfume notes for Chanel No. 5 perfume was inaccurate. The listing of notes including rose should read May rose. Matthew in Customer Relations at Chanel in Manhattan verified that May rose is the accurate fragrance note, not simply rose. Melissa Chamberlin, Ph.D. (talk) 19:15, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

Laboratory tests have shown that Chanel No. 5 contains secretions from the fixative, making the scent last a long time. Animal rights groups such as the World Society for the Protection of Animals express concern that civet is harvested in a method cruel to animals. The Chanel company claims that, starting in 1998, natural civet has been replaced with a synthetic substitute.<ref>[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/010525.html The Straight Dope: Does civet come from tortured cats?

==Cultural influence==
*Sales increased in the 1950s, especially after the perfume was introduced in the United States. Movie star Marilyn Monroe's endorsement of the brand is said to have contributed to its popularity. In 1953, when asked what she wore in bed, Monroe famously replied, "Why, Chanel No. 5, of course." Chanel herself is quoted as saying, "A woman should wear fragrance wherever she expects to be kissed."

*Andy Warhol sealed Chanel No. 5's status as cultural icon when he made nine silk screens of the perfume, elevating it to Campbell Soup status. And in 1959 the packaging itself made it into the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.
