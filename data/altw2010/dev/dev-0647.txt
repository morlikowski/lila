Lleolir '''Canol Dinas Abertawe''', yn Ninas a Sir Abertawe, ychydig i ffwrdd o'r Dociau Abertawe gael eu hail-ddatblygu'n ardal fusnes a phreswyl gymysg.

== Hanes ==
Bomiwyd canol y ddinas yn ddifrifol ym 1941 yn ystod digwyddiad a gydnabodir bellach fel '''Y Blitz Tair Noson'''. Dinistriwyd 41 erw a oedd yn cynnwys 857 o adeiladau yng nghanol y ddinas. Bu'n rhaid i nifer o fusnesau gael eu ad-leoli i gyrion yr ardal a ddinistriwyd. Cymerwyd nifer o flynyddoedd i adfer Abertawe. O ganlyniad i'r hen ardal siopa o amgylch Y Stryd Fawr wedi'i dinistrio, ail-adeiladwyd prif ganolfan siopa o amgylch y Ffordd y Brenin newydd.

== Siopa ==
Yng nghalon y ddinas lleolir Canolfan Siopa Dewi Sant. Stryd Rhydychen yw prif stryd siopa Abertawe. Dominyddir pen dwyreiniol Stryd Rhydychen gan nifer o gwmnïau cenedlaethol, tra bod pen gorllewinol y stryd yn gartref i nifer o siopau lleol.

Canolfan siopa fodern yw'r Cwadrant a agorwyd ar ddiwedd y 1970au, ond ailwampiwyd y ganolfan yn gyfan gwbl yn y 1990au gyda tho gwydr yn llenwi'r arcedau tywyll cynt â goleuni. Dominyddir y ganolfan gan siopau mawr megis Debenhams a Boots. Lleolir maes parcio aml-lawr i'r de, tra bod Gorsaf Fysiau Abertawe ar ben gorllewinol y ganolfan.

Tu hwnt i faes parcio aml-lawr y Cwadrant y mae archfrachnad Tesco a'i faes parcio ei hun. Hen safle'r gweithfeydd nwy yw hwn, ond ail-ddatblygwyd y darn o dir erbyn y flwyddyn 2000 wrth i Tesco adleoli o'i gyn-safle ar Ffordd y Brenin o dan hen sinema'r Odeon.

Cynhelir marchnadoedd agored ar strydoedd canol y ddinas yn bennaf yn ystod tymor y Nadolig, ar hyd Stryd Rhydychen, Ffordd y Dysysoges a Sgwâr y Castell.

== Y Stryd Fawr a Stryd y Castell ==
Arferai’r Stryd Fawr fod yn un o brif strydoedd siopa Abertawe. Dinistriwyd rhannau helaeth ohoni yn ystod yr Ail Ryfel Byd.

Saif Castell Abertawe ar ben deheuol y ddwy stryd hyn, gyferbyn â Sgwâr y Castell a ailwampiwyd yn ystod y 1990au wrth i slabiau carreg Efrog a ffynnon ddŵr ddod at ei gilydd er mwyn ffurfio amffitheatr er mwyn disodli’r ardd ddiarffordd gynt a warthnodwyd yn ardal beryglus o dorcyfraith. Ar ben arall y stryd y mae Gorsaf Drenau Abertawe a Gwesty’r Grand. Masnachwyr preifat, ychydig dafarndai, bwytai a mannau gwerthu bwyd sydyn sydd rhwng yr orsaf a’r castell, yn llenwi adeiladau a oedd yn gartrefi i gwmnïau cenedlaethol gynt megis Littlewoods, Woolworths, W.H. Smith a Comet.

'''Swansea city centre''' in UK, lies slightly inland from the Castle ward and the eastern fringes of the Uplands ward. However it is currently expanding eastwards with the re-development of the north of Swansea Docks in to a combined comercial and residential district.

==History==
The heart of the city centre was bombed severely in 1941 in what is now termed the "Three Nights Blitz".<ref name="SwanseaAnIllustratedHistory">{{cite book

In the long term the bombing necessitated the complete rebuilding of the city centre, a task which fell upon the county borough of Swansea.  Preliminary plans were drawn up in 1943, a Compulsory Purchase order was obtained in 1946 and reconstruction work began in 1947.  The reconstruction task took over thirty years to accomplish.<ref name="SwanseaAnIllustratedHistory" />  With the old shopping centre around High Street flattened, Swansea's main shopping district was rebuilt around the new Kingsway.

==Areas==

===Swansea Market/Quadrant Centre vicinity===
At the heart of the city centre lies Swansea Market, the Quadrant centre and the St. David's Shopping Centre.  The Quadrant Shopping Centre is a shopping centre that opened in the late 1970s. Chain stores such as Debenhams dominate the centre.  On the south side of the shopping mall is a multi-storey car park.  Located on the west side of the centre is Swansea bus station.

Beside the Quadrant centre, to the south east is the Tesco superstore.  The store is located on the site of a former gasworks.  Tesco have submitted a planning application to re-develop the store as a Tesco Extra format store.  However, the local council prefers to re-develop the site to enhance the link between the city centre and the coastal area with Tesco re-locating to a site in the Parc Tawe vicinity.

====High Street====
High Street was once the main shopping street in Swansea and formed the central axis of the shopping centre.  It was completely destroyed in World War II.  Leaving just a few buildings standing gutted including half of the now demolished Woolworth Building, the Elysium Cinema building, the New Castle Buildings and smaller stores to the northern end including the historical Bush Inn.

Palace theatre, the venue where Anthony Hopkins staged his first professional performance, the oldest theatre in Wales, one of only 2 remaining purpose built music halls left in the United Kingdom and the first place in Wales to screen a moving picture.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/3239364.stm BBC NEWS | Wales | South West Wales | Oldest theatre under hammer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It was once used as a nightclub but is now mostly derelict.

====The Kingsway/Oxford Street vicinity====
Until the development of Wind Street as a nightlife zone, the Kingsway was the centre of night life in Swansea.  While many of the bars have shut down due to competition from Wind Street bars, the largest night clubs in Swansea are still located here.  Apart from the night life venues, The Kingsway has a number of banks, shops, fast food outlets and branch of the YMCA.  Swansea's former main Post Office was located on this road too but recently moved to W.H. Smith inside the Quadrant Shopping Centre about 250 yards away.

In 2006, the Kingsway was re-engineered to become a one way street for cars.  The southern traffic lanes are now dedicated two way bus lanes developed in conjunction with the First Cymru's new Swansea Metro bus route.  At the eastern end of the Kingsway was a large roundabout incorporating a pedestrian subway.  The subway has now been filled in and the roundabout replaced with a traffic light crossroad and wider pedestrian walkways.

Oxford Street is now the main shopping street in Swansea.  The street is dominated by chain stores.  It belongs to a pedestrianised zone around Swansea Market and the Quadrant Centre.  Oxford Street actually stretches from Castle Square to the east all the way to the far west of the Sandfields area.  The Sandfields stretch of Oxford street is mainly residential.

Princess Way links Oxford Street and The Kingsway to the east.  The David Evans department store on the street has been demolished and is currently undergoing re-development.  

Street markets are held in the city centre during the Christmas season.  They are usually sited on Oxford Street, Princess Way and Castle Square.

====Wind Street/Salubrious Place====

Wind (waɪnd) Street was once a haunt of the poet Dylan Thomas and location of the covered alleyway 'Salubrious Passage'. It became a backwater in the second half of the 20th century when the commercial centre of Swansea shifted.  It boasts the highest concentration of listed buildings in Swansea.<ref></ref>  Following redevelopment at the beginning of the 21st century it is now known for its pubs, bars, clubs and restaurants, including the No-Sign Wine Bar and The Olde Cross Keys pub.  2007 saw the completion of the development of the street's lower, south-eastern end as 'Salubrious Place', including an Aspers Casino, a Vue Cinema, a hotel, parking and additional eating and drinking venues.

During the Second World War, the pubs of Wind Street  saw the visit of a young star-to-be.  A group of American GIs stationed in Swansea entered the Adelphi pub, with one of them ordering milk instead of alcohol.  An Australian soldier also stationed in Swansea saw this and proceeded to taunt the young GI that he was not strong enough to drink alcohol.  Unfortunately for him he had picked on the young Rocky Marciano who went on to become one the world's greatest heavyweight boxers.  Rocky floored him with one punch.  Marciano himself confirmed this story <ref></ref>.
