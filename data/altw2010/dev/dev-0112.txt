'''Indianola''' is a Kitsap County, 2000 census. It was originally established as a summer community and was a stop for Mosquito Fleet ferries until the 1950s.

==Geography==
Indianola is located at  (47.751512, -122.522878). It lies on the north shore of Kingston and northeast of Suquamish. 

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 5.3&nbsp;square miles (13.8&nbsp;km²), of which, 4.8&nbsp;square miles (12.6&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.5&nbsp;square miles (1.2&nbsp;km²) of it (8.82%) is water.

== History ==
Indianola was formed on the portion of the Port Madison Indian Reservation which had been allotted to Kakue Beedee in 1886. The allotment eventually passed to the sons of Alpheus Loughrey, a white man who had married Katie, the daughter of Beedee's wife Tu-Tue-Tue by a previous marriage.

Development began in 1916 with the formation of the Indianola Beach Land Company by W. L. Gazzam to promote real estate sales on the land owned by the Loughreys. A dock and a store were built as amenities to attract buyers; a second store, the Beachcomber, was built the next year. From the beginning, Indianola has been a vacation community, with its population inflating considerably in the summertime.

In the early 20th century, most transportation on Puget Sound was by steamer, and a community’s dock was often its only lifeline to the outside world. Such was the case for the young community of Indianola Beach, and by 1918 a steamer was docking there every weekend. Daily ferry service was initiated in 1919 when Carl Hendrix organized twelve passengers to pay in advance for one year’s daily service between Indianola Beach and Seattle. Hendrix and his wife established a school the same year.
