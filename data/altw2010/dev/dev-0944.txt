'''ボブ・オートン・ジュニア'''（''Bob Orton Jr.''、アメリカのカンザスシティ出身）。父親のボブ・オートン、兄弟のバリー・オートン、息子のランディ・オートンもプロレスラーである。'''カウボーイ・ボブ・オートン'''のリングネームで知られる。愛称は「エース」。

1980年代を代表する名脇役ではあるが、今一つスター性に欠けルックスが地味だったこともあって主役クラスの活躍はできなかった。しかしその技術と独創性は飛び抜けており、レスラー仲間や関係者、玄人筋のファンからの評価は非常に高い。

== 経歴 ==
ヒロ・マツダ、エディー・グラハム、ジャック・ブリスコらにトレーニングされた後に、1972年にプロレスデビュー。NWA加盟団体、AWA、ICW（ランディ・サベージの父アンジェロ・ポッフォの団体）を中心に活動し、1984年にWWF（現WWE）へ入団する。ロディ・パイパー、ポール・オンドーフと共にハルク・ホーガンに敵対する悪役三人組の一人として活躍した。またこの頃から2年以上、左前腕にギプスを装着し、凶器として用いることもあった。第一回レッスルマニアのメインイベントでは彼の凶器ギプス攻撃が決まり手となっている。程なくオンドーフがグループを離れて以後も、パイパーとは名コンビを組み続けた。WWFは1987年頃、パイパー、オンドーフと同時期に退団する。

WWF退団後はNWAやSMW、UWF（日本のUWFではない）、各地のインディー団体で活動し、1999年頃からはセミリタイア状態だが、現在でも年に数回は試合にも出場している。

マネージャーとして活動、試合も僅かながらだが行っている。

アルマゲドンにおいて、ジ・アンダーテイカーとの試合中にストーリー上吐血した。オートンはかつて血液から感染する肝炎をわずらっていた事があり、かつこの事を知りながらストーリーを変えなかったWWE脚本陣に対してジ・アンダーテイカーが激怒し、結果ボブ・オートン・ジュニアが絡むストーリーラインは終了することとなって2006年2月13日にWWEから解雇された。

'''Robert Keith Orton, Jr.''' (born American retired professional wrestler, better known by his Bob Orton, Sr., and brother, Barry O, were also professional wrestlers.

==Career==
Orton started wrestling in 1972 in the Georgia territories, sometimes performing under a mask and using the name "Young Mr. Wrestling." He often teamed with his father, Bob Orton. He made a name for himself in the early to mid-1980s in the National Wrestling Alliance, where he formed a tag team with Don Kernodle and won the NWA World Tag Team Championship.  Orton was also involved in an angle where he and Dick Slater accepted a $25,000 offer by then NWA World Champion Harley Race to end the career of Ric Flair in 1983.  Orton, Slater, and Race attacked Flair and delivered a spike piledriver, "injuring" Flair's neck. Flair subsequently "retired" then returned and assaulted Slater and Orton with a baseball bat.  

In 1984, Orton re-joined the World Wrestling Federation as a heel. He was often addressed as '''"Ace" Orton''' by gimmick was that he had supposedly had his left forearm broken in a match with cast for the rest of 1985 and early 1986. He used the cast to illegally win his matches by striking opponents with it behind the back of the referee. 

'Cowboy' Bob was involved in the main event of the very first WrestleMania at Madison Square Garden in 1985, being in the corner of Piper and 'Mr. Wonderful' Paul Orndorff in their match against Hulk Hogan and Mr. T. Bob accidentally cost his team the match after an attempted cheat backfired, resulting in him hitting Orndorff with the cast.  Orton also will go down in history for having shared the main event against WWF Champion Hulk Hogan on the premiere episode of Saturday Night's Main Event on NBC broadcast May 11, 1985.  Orton lost by disqualification due to the interference of Piper.

Orton remained with Piper for the remainder of 1985, feuding with Orndorff and a variety of partners, such as Hogan, André the Giant, and Bruno Sammartino. In early 1986, Orton began wearing a cast as a neutralizer and the WWF ordered both men to remove the cast.

Orton was dubbed "Boxing" Bob in early 1986 after the cast came off and fought Saturday Night's Main Event. This match served as a setup for the Piper-Mr. T match at WrestleMania 2 during which Orton was introduced as "Ace in Comedy and Funnyman" by guest ring announcer Joan Rivers who misread the card. 

Piper and Orton went their separate ways after WrestleMania, with Piper taking a hiatus and Orton in the meantime becoming the bodyguard for Piper's talk-segment successor Adorable Adrian Adonis; Adonis had Orton wear a pink cowboy hat. Orton would turn against Piper when Piper returned to reclaim his segment time from Adonis and Piper and Orton wrestled in many matches throughout the country, typically with Piper winning. During this time, Orton formed a tag team with managed by Mr. Fuji. 
They won several matches and appeared at WrestleMania III, losing to the Can-Am Connection. They split up during the summer of 1987 on bad terms.

Orton returned to the NWA briefly in 1989 before returning to the independent circuit. He retired from wrestling in 1999.  Orton returned to the ring at Millennium Wrestling Federation Soul Survivor II [http://www.MWFprowrestling.com] in November 2004, teaming with Todd Hanson and Beau Douglas to defeat "The Ugandan Giant" Kamala, Gino Marktino, and Ox Baker's Executioner.

===World Wrestling Entertainment===
On February 3, 2005, Bob Orton was announced as a 2005 inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame.

In the weeks preceding Randy's feud with SmackDown!, Orton begged The Undertaker to show mercy on his son in order to distract The Undertaker long enough for his son to sneak into the ring and hit the RKO.<ref></ref> At WrestleMania, he (unsuccessfully) interfered in the match between Orton and The Undertaker, striking The Undertaker with his cast.<ref></ref>

On SummerSlam, Orton interfered in a rematch between Randy and The Undertaker, this time enabling his son to defeat The Undertaker. Orton then began accompanying Randy to ringside during his matches, and teamed with his son at No Mercy on Ken Kennedy to face Roddy Piper, Batista, and sleeper hold.

On the December 16, 2005 episode of SmackDown!, Orton disguised himself as one of the Undertaker's druids and carried The Undertaker's signature urn to ringside as The Undertaker came to the ring to confront Randy. Orton remained at ringside after the other druids had left, distracting The Undertaker and enabling Randy to attack him. Orton then handed Randy the urn, which Randy used to knock The Undertaker unconscious.

At Armageddon 2005, Orton (still holding the urn) accompanied Randy to ringside for his Tombstone Piledriver to both Ortons and then covering Randy for the win. Bob Orton bladed during the match and bled on both Randy and The Undertaker; this resulted in controversy when he was later widely reported to be suffering from the blood-borne disease hepatitis.

On February 13, 2006, Orton was released from WWE.

Orton currently works as a performer and co-owner of Tennessee Mountain Wrestling in Knoxville, Tennessee.
