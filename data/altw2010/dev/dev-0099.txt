'''Arthur D. Little''' is an international MIT chemist who discovered acetate, and co-worker Roger Griffin, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Arthur D. Little pioneered the concept of contracted technology research. 

The company played key roles in the development of operations research, the word processor, the first synthetic penicillin, LexisNexis, and NASDAQ. Today the company is one of the world's leading management consulting firms, working closely with Fortune 500 firms across the globe.

== Overview ==
Arthur D. Little grew quickly from its roots in contracted research into the lucrative management consulting services arena and defined itself as a pioneer and industry leader from the 1960s right through to the 1990s. It produced the European Commission's first white paper on telecommunications deregulation and helped privatize British Rail, generally regarded as one of the most complex privatization exercises in the world. By 2001, Arthur D. Little had 2000 employees around the world, but over-expansion of its management consulting business, coupled to management's failure to spin-off a niche high technology consulting practice, resulted in financial losses causing Arthur D. Little to file chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and effectively go out of business after 116 years. At an auction in 2002, Paris based Altran Technologies bought the Arthur D. Little brand name and financed a management buyout of the non-US offices.

In 2007, the new Arthur D. Little has about 1000 employees across 30 offices in 20 countries around the world, and typically manages around 2000 assignments in 60 countries every year. Arthur D. Little today has successfully rebuilt its Oil & Gas practice and is well regarded for its strong expertise in the telecommunications industry with additional centers of excellence in automotive, chemicals, healthcare and public sector consulting.  Whilst Europe provided the bulk of the growth since 2002, its North American offices are expanding as it continues to manage high profile clients and assignments around the world. 

In 2006 R. Clarke, the Chief executive officer who successfully led the new Arthur D. Little from 2001, stepped down and "Dr" M. Träm was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, and charged with continuing Arthur D. Little's regrowth. Arthur D. Little is currently ranked as one of the top management consulting firms.<ref>[http://www.vault.com/nr/consulting_rankings/consulting_rankings.jsp?consulting2007=2&ch_id=252 Vault.com 2006]).</ref>  Recent growth since 2006 has been around 20% a year but much of this has been the result of acquisitions or of re-integrating separate offices using the ADL brand name.

Arthur D. Little publishes a bi-annual thought leadership collection called PRISM <ref>(which is available from its website http://www.arthurdlittle.com/global/en/insights/prism or free on demand from any of the corporate offices)</ref>

== 概要 ==
MOT（Management of Technology）に近いビジョンを掲げていた。1978年には日本法人が設立され、現在の社長は原田裕介。全世界に約1000人のコンサルタントが所属している。

2002年には米国本社が投資の失敗からChapter11（いわゆる民事再生法）の適用を受けた。その後ADLはフランス系コンサルティング・ファームのアルトランによって買収され、その傘下で活動を続けている。そのため現在はADLの本社も欧州に存在する。

創業者のバックグラウンドによる影響か、技術力を中心としたマネジメントのコンサルティングに強みを持つ。具体的にはMOT、知的財産マネジメントを中心として事業を行っている。
