In 724, Empress Wang's brother Wang Shouyi (王守一) was discovered to have used magic to try to regain favor for Empress Wang.  Empress Wang was deposed and died soon thereafter, and Wang Shouyi was forced to commit suicide.  Emperor Xuanzong considered creating Consort Wu empress, but eventually did not do so do to official opposition based on two grounds -- that Consort Wu was of the family of Emperor Xuanzong's powerful grandmother Wu Zetian, who seized the throne herself for over a decade as "emperor" and interrupted Tang Dynasty, and that Consort Wu was not Li Siqian's mother and therefore might seek to endanger Li Siqian.  Still, Consort Wu's son Li Qing (李清) the Prince of Shou became Emperor Xuanzong's favorite son, and Li Siqian began to lose favor.

In 725, Li Siqian's name was changed to Li Hong.
