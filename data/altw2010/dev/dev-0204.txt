== Hintergründe ==

Mike Myers sagte in einem Interview für MTV, er begann die Vorbereitungen der Produktion dieses Films nachdem er vom Tod von George Harrison erfahren habe. Am gleichen Tag habe er einen Fanbrief Harrisons bekommen – den letzten, den der Musiker je geschrieben habe. Dies habe ihn bewogen, einen Film über spirituelle Themen zu drehen.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1585104/story.jhtml www.mtv.com], abgerufen am 12. Juni 2008</ref>

Der Film wurde in Burbank aufgenommen.<ref>[http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/137 www.scoringsessions.com], abgerufen am 12. Juni 2008</ref>

==Plot==
Darren Roanoke (Mike Myers) to help Darren with his stress so that the team can hopefully break their losing streak.

==Production==
Filming took place in Toronto, Ontario for two months.

Myers said on The Late Show With David Letterman the film is a reflection of the spiritual journey he went on after his father died in 1991. Development of the film began in 2001, during the last day of filming on ''Austin Powers in Goldmember'': Myers heard George Harrison had died. He then received a letter from Harrison, and Myers thought, "'OK, universe, I think I get it. This is the movie you want me to make.'"<ref></ref>

==Promotion==
Mike Myers appeared in the seventh season finale of ''American Idol'' as his character Pitka, the "spiritual director" of that show.

==Critical reception== 
''The Love Guru'' was panned by most critics. As of July 22, 2008, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 15% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 125 reviews&mdash;with the consensus that the film "features far too many gross-out gags, and too few earned laughs, ranking as one of Mike Myers' poorest outings."<ref></ref> Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 24 out of 100, based on 33 reviews.<ref></ref>

Jay Stone of the ''Chopra is used almost as a product placement, taking a proud spot alongside a circus, a brand of cinnamon buns, the Leafs and, of course, Mike Myers." Stone also wrote, "the 9 to 5 are oddly watchable - but mostly the film is 88 minutes of ridiculous sight gags and obscene puns."<ref></ref>

A. O. Scott of ''The New York Times'' wrote "The word 'unfunny' surely applies to Mr. Myers’s obnoxious attempts to find mirth in physical and cultural differences but does not quite capture the strenuous unpleasantness of his performance. No, ''The Love Guru'' is downright antifunny, an experience that makes you wonder if you will ever laugh again."<ref></ref>

Joann Miller of ''The Miami Herald'' added that it was "the worst movie I have ever seen. I only wish I could return my memories and get a refund but unfortunately the comedic massacre that was this film will never leave my  mind."<ref></ref>
