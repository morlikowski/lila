'''José Manuel Cerqueira Afonso dos Santos''', also known as '''''Zeca'' Afonso''' (pron. ) or only '''''Zeca''''' (August 2, 1929 - February 23, 1987) was born in Aveiro, Portugal, son of José Nepomuceno Afonso, a judge, and Maria das Dores. Zeca is among the most influential folk and political musicians in Portuguese history. He became an icon among Portuguese left-wing activists due to the role of his music in the resistance against the dictatorial regime of Oliveira Salazar that triumphed with the democratic Carnation Revolution. In the ensuing revolutionary process, Zeca was a very active musician and continued composing political and folk songs, often criticizing the post-revolutionary changes. Years after his death, Zeca Afonso is still widely listened to, not only in Portugal, but also abroad.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

José Afonso was born in Aveiro on August 2, 1929, at 10:30 AM.

In 1930 his parents travelled to Angola, a Portuguese colony at the time, where his father had been placed as a judge in the city of Silva Porto (present-day Kuito). José Afonso stayed at Aveiro, in a house named "Fonte das Cinco Bicas", due to some health problems with his aunt Gigé and his uncle Xico, who called himself "republican and anticlerical". In 1933 Zeca travelled to Angola at his mother's request. On the ship Zeca met a missionary who became his companion during the voyage. José Afonso stayed for three years in Angola, where he began his primary education.

In 1936 he returned to Aveiro and in 1937 he travelled for the second time, this time to Mozambique where his parents were now, with his brother and sister, João and Mariazinha.

He returned to Portugal in 1938, this time to the house of his uncle Filomeno, mayor of the town of Belmonte. There he finished the fourth grade. His uncle, a fierce fascist supporter, made him a member of the "Mocidade Portuguesa", a youth organization with fascist tendencies, Zeca would later consider those years among the worst in his life.

He went to Coimbra in 1940 in order to continue his studies. He studied in D. João III high school and lived with his aunt Avrilete. His family went from Mozambique to East Timor, where his father continued his job as Judge. Mariazinha went with them while his brother João returned to Portugal. With the occupation of Timor by the Japanese, José Afonso received no news from his parents for three years, until the end of World War II in 1945.

=== University years ===

In that year he started singing his first songs as a ''bicho'' (which means something like a beast or a worm), a traditional rank of the University of Coimbra for high school students (José Afonso was in the 11th grade). He was known as ''bicho-cantor'' ("the singing beast"), which granted him the right of not being ''rapado'' ("head shaved") by the organized ''trupes'' ("groups") of older students who were one of the most important symbols of the university's traditions. 

From 1946 to 1948 he worked to finish high school, after two prior attempts failed due to his chaotic lifestyle spent among the older students. He met Maria Amália de Oliveira, whom he married secretly due to his parents' opposition. He travelled with some of the most important university musical groups, as Orfeon Académico de Coimbra, and played football for the Associação Académica de Coimbra. In 1949 he started studying History and Philosophy.

In January of 1953 his first son, José Manuel, was born. That year, he released his first recordings, of which no copies remain today.

From 1953 to 1955 he performed the compulsory military service. He was sent to Macau, but he was sent home due to health problems. After that he was stationed at Coimbra. He experienced many economic difficulties and divorced. After his military service, and now with two children, José Manuel and Helena (born in 1954), Zeca finished his studies with an 11 (out of 20) with a thesis about Jean-Paul Sartre.

=== Early political action ===

In 1956 he released his first record, ''Fados de Coimbra''.

In 1956/57 he became a teacher and worked in the south of Portugal.

Due to his financial problems he sent his children to Mozambique in 1958 where his parents were at the time. In that year he became enthralled by Humberto Delgado's presidential campaign (which Delgado lost due to massive fraud perpetrated by the fascist regime). In 1959 he started singing in many popular groups around the country, which granted him more and more contact with the harsh living conditions of the Portuguese people.

In 1960 his fourth record, ''Balada do Outono'' (Autumn Ballad), was released. 

From 1961 to 1962 he followed very closely the student strikes and demonstrations demanding democracy and the end of the fascist regime which were brutally repressed by the police.

He continued releasing many of his songs and introduceed important new guitar arrangements.

He played in Switzerland, Germany, and Sweden, in a group of fado and guitars, with Adriano Correia de Oliveira, José Niza, Jorge Godinho, Durval Moreirinhas and the singer Esmeralda Amoedo.

In May of 1964, José Afonso played in the Musical Society ''Workers' Brotherhood'' in Grândola, where he found the inspiration to compose the song ''Grândola, Vila Morena'', which would be the signal for the start of the Carnation Revolution in 1974.

Also in 1964 the album ''Baladas e Canções'' was released.

From 1964 to 1967, José Afonso was at Lourenço Marques (now Maputo) with Zélia (his second wife); there he met his children. In his last two years there he taught in Beira, where he composed music for the Bertolt Brecht play ''The Exception and The Rule''. In 1965 his daughter Joana was born.

In 1967 he returned to Lisbon impressed by the brutal colonial reality and by the colonial war against the liberation movement of Mozambique, FRELIMO and left his older son, José Manuel, with the latter's grandparents in Mozambique. He became a teacher in Setúbal; after that he developed a severe health crisis which left him hospitalized for 20 days. When he left the hospital, he found that he had been expelled from public school teaching because of his leftist politics and because the regime censors considered his songs strongly subversive. His book ''Cantares de José Afonso'' (José Afonso's songs) was published. The Portuguese Communist Party invited him personally to become a party member but Zeca refused because of his bourgeois origins. In that year he signed a contract with ''Orfeu'', which would record 70% of his works.

Expelled from the teaching job, he became a personal helper for some students and he started singing much more regularly in the popular groups on the south bank of the escudos per month on the condition that he recorded an album per year.

=== Anti-fascist activities ===

In 1969, with the replacement of António de Oliveira Salazar by Marcelo Caetano, the fascist-controlled nation got a very slight taste of democracy, such as permission to rebuild a democratic Labour Union movement. José Afonso joined the movement and supported it by all the means he could; he also took part in the second wave of student rebellion against the regime in Coimbra. He released the album ''Contos Velhos Rumos Novos'' and the single ''Menina dos Olhos Tristes'' which contains the popular song ''Canta Camarada'' (Sing, Sing, Comrade!) which became a choice for being adopted by the Portuguese Communist Party as an unofficial anthem, but in the end, it wasn't. He received an award for the best album, which he received again in 1970 and 1971. For the first time in a Zeca album, an instrument other than the guitar was used. His fourth and last son, Pedro, was born.

In 1970 the album ''Traz Outro Amigo Também'' (Bring Another Friend Too), recorded in London, in the Pye studios, was released.  It is the first album without Rui Pato, forbbiden by PIDE (the fascist political police) to travel. On March 21 he received from the Portuguese press an award for his ''high quality work as singer and composer and for his decisive influence upon Portuguese popular music''. He participated in an International Festival in Cuba.

By the end of 1971, the famous album ''Cantigas do Maio'' (Songs of May), recorded near Paris, in Château d'Hérouville studios, was released. The album is generally considered the best album of his career.

His 1972 album is called ''Eu Vou Ser Como a Toupeira'' (I Will Be Like the Mole), recorded in Madrid, at Cellada studios.

In 1973 José Afonso continued his ''pilgrimage'', singing everywhere. Many of his appearances were forcibly cancelled by the PIDE/DGS. In April he was arrested and spent 20 days in Caxias prison (a prison mostly used for political prisoners) until the end of May. In the prison he wrote the poem ''Era Um Redondo Vocábulo''. By Christmas, he published the album ''Venham Mais Cinco'', recorded in Paris and on which José Mário Branco collaborated. Janine de Waleyne, from the Swingle Singers, a famous jazz vocal group, participated in the song ''Venham Mais Cinco''. 

On March 29 1974, the ''Coliseu'', in Lisbon, got a full house to listen to José Afonso, Adriano Correia de Oliveira, José Jorge Letria, Manuel Freire, José Barata Moura, Fernando Tordo, and many others, who ended the concert by singing ''Grândola, Vila Morena''. Some soldiers from the revolutionary movement that would take part in April in the Carnation Revolution, the ''MFA'', were in the audience and chose ''Grândola'' for the coutersign of the Revolution. A month later, on April 25, the fascist regime was destroyed in a nearly-bloodless military coup. He released the album ''Coro dos Tribunais'' (Courthouse Chorus),  recorded in London, again at Pye, with musical arrangements by Fausto. The album includes Brechtian songs, composed in Mozambique in the period between 1964 and 1967--''Coro dos Tribunais'' and ''Eu Marchava de Dia e de Noite''.
