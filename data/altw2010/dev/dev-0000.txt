The '''Boyana Church''' (, ''Boyanska tsarkva'') is a medieval Bulgarian Orthodox church situated on the outskirts of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, in the Boyana quarter. The east wing of the two-storey church was originally constructed in the late 10th or early 11th century, then the central wing was added in the 13th century under the Second Bulgarian Empire, the whole building being finished with a further expansion to the west in the middle of the 19th century.
The church owes its world fame mainly to its frescoes from 1259. They form a second layer over the paintings from earlier centuries and represent one of the most complete and well-preserved monuments of Eastern European mediaeval art. A total of 89 scenes with 240 human images are depicted on the walls of the church. The painter is anonymous, but is possibly from the Tarnovo Art School.

18 scenes in the Venetian fleet. The portraits of the patrons of the church — Sebastocrator Kaloyan and his wife Desislava, as well as those of Bulgarian tsar Constantine Tikh and Tsaritsa Irina, are thought to be among the most impressive and lifelike frescoes in the church, and are located on the north wall of the church.

Besides the first layer of 11th-12th century frescoes, of which only fragments are preserved, and the famous second layer of murals from 1259, the church also has a smaller number of later frescoes from the 14th and 16th-17th century, as well as from 1882.

The monument was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979. The frescoes were restored and cleaned in 1912-1915 by an Austrian and a Bulgarian specialist, as well in 1934 and 1944. The church was closed for the public in 1977 in order to be conservated and restored and once again opened in 2000.

The church patrons' inscription in Middle Bulgarian from 1259 reads:<sup>[http://www.boyanachurch.org/pictures/gallery/pic8s.jpg]</sup>

== Architecture ==

The Boyana Church was built in three stages: in the late 10th and early 11th, the mid-13th, and the mid-19th centuries.
The oldest section (the eastern church) is a small one-apse cross-vaulted church with inbuilt cruciform supports. It was built in the late 10th and early 11th century.
The second section, which adjoins the eastern church, was commissioned by Sebastocrator Kaloyan and his wife Dessislava and in the mid-13th century. This building belongs to the two-floor tomb-church type. It consists of a ground-floor family sepulchre with a semi-cylindrical vault and two arcosolia on the north and south walls, and an upper-floor family chapel identical in design to the eastern church. The exterior is decorated with ceramic ornaments.
The last section was built on donations from the local community in the mid-19th century.

== Frescoes ==

===First layer===

The first layer of frescoes, which originally covered the entire eastern church, dates from the 11th-12th-century. Fragments of those frescoes have been preserved in the lower parts of the apse and the north wall, and in the upper part of the west wall and the south vault.

===Second layer===

According to the donor’s inscription on the north wall of the second section, the second layer of frescoes dates from 1259. Those frescoes were painted over the earlier layer by a team of unknown artists, who also decorated the two floors of the building commissioned by Sebastocrator Kaloyan.

De '''Kerk van Bojana''' is een middeleeuwse kerk in Sofia. Hij bestaat uit drie delen, die respectievelijk in de 10e, 13e en 19e eeuw werden gebouwd.

De kerk dankt zijn roem aan de fresco's uit 1259. Deze vormen een tweede laag over de schilderijen van vroegere eeuwen en behoren tot de meest complete en best bewaarde monumenten van Oost-Europese middeleeuwse kunst. 
De muren van de kerk bevatten in totaal 89 scènes met 240 menselijke afbeeldingen. De schilder is anoniem, maar de makers behoorden tot de schildersschool van Turnovo.

Een totaal van achttien scènes in de Nicolaas uit. De schilder voegde hier bepaalde eigentijdse aspecten toe. In het Mirakel op Zee herinneren het schip en de hoeden van de zeelui aan de Venetiaanse vloot. 
De portretten van de schutspatronen van de kerk (Kalojan en zijn vrouw Desislava), evenals die van Bulgaarse tsaar Konstantin Tich en tsarina Irina maken deel uit van de meest interessante en levensechte fresco's in de kerk. 

Dit monument werd toegevoegd aan de UNESCO Werelderfgoedlijst in 1979.
