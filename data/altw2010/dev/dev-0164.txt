'''"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)"''' is a song by the English rock band single "Whole Lotta Love". The song is about a groupie who annoyed the band early in their career.<ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.</ref>

It is often noted that this is guitarist Jimmy Page's least favorite Led Zeppelin song, and was thus never performed in concert, except a single show in Dusseldorf (a little snappet right after Heartbreaker), March 12, 1970, as bootlegs from that date show.  It was also one of the few Led Zeppelin songs on which he sang backing vocals. Conversely, singer Robert Plant took a liking to the song, and played it on his 1990 solo tour.

For the recording of this track, Page played on a Vox 12-string guitar.<ref name=page93>[http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_93.gw Interview with Jimmy Page], ''Guitar World'' magazine, 1993</ref>

When heard on the radio it was typically played immediately after their song "Heartbreaker", as it flows seamlessly from the abrupt ending of that song on the original album. Yet the band never played these songs together on stage at The Song Remains the Same" and "The Rain Song" &mdash; the first two tracks from their 1973 album ''Houses of the Holy'').

'''Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)''' on kuuluisan englantilaisen rockyhtye Led Zeppelinin kappale. Kappale on julkaistu yhtyeen toisella albumilla ''Led Zeppelin II'' vuonna 1969. Se on myös julkaistu yhtyeen ''Whole Lotta Love'' -singlen kääntöpuolella. Kappale kertoo bändäristä, joka ärsytti yhtyettä sen uran alkuaikoina.

Yhtyeen kitaristi Jimmy Pagen on usein mainittu vihaavan kappaletta, ja siksi sitä ei esitetty Led Zeppelinin konserteissa. Se on myös yksi harvoista Led Zeppelinin kappaleista, jossa Page lauloi taustalla. Toisin kuin Page, yhtyeen laulaja Robert Plant piti kappaleesta, ja esittikin sen usein vuoden 1990 soolokiertueellaan.
