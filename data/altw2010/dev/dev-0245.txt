==概説==
日本においてはコマーシャル）のスポンサー料やアニメの著作権料と並んで重要な収益の一つである。また、番組制作会社にとっては再放送の放映権料を見込んで膨大な制作費を充てることができる。

日本の多くの番組は自局の属する系列向けに販売されているが、番組によっては系列以外の事業者への販売もある。

アメリカで「'''シンジケイション'''」(Syndication)と呼ばれる事象も番組販売のことである。元々制作会社が制作から放映権の販売までを一括して行なっており、日中のトーク番組や情報番組などが多くを占める。一定数のコマーシャルを包括して売りに出されるようになったことで、放送局は少ない予算で購入できる。また、ネットワークで放送された番組も一定の放送話数（おおよそ100話）を超えると、再放送の放映権がネットワークから制作会社に移行され、シンジケイション経由で放送できる。

In broadcasting, '''syndication''' is the sale of the right to broadcast radio shows and television shows to multiple individual stations, without going through a broadcast network. It is common in countries where television is organized around networks with local affiliates, notably the United States. In the rest of the world, however, countries have mainly centralized networks without local affiliates and syndication is less common. Shows can also be syndicated internationally.

==Types of syndication==
* '''first-run syndication''' refers to programming that is broadcast for the first time as a syndicated show (not any one particular network), or at least first so offered in a given country (programs originally created and broadcast outside of the United States, first presented on a network in their country of origin, have often been syndicated in the U.S. and in some other countries);
* '''off-network syndication''' involves the sale of a program that was originally run on network television: a rerun;
* '''public-broadcasting syndication''' has arisen in the U.S. as a parallel service to stations in the PBS service and the handful of independent public stations.

When syndicating a show, the production company, or a distribution company or "syndicator," usually attempts to sell the show to one station in each media market or area, in the country and around the world.  If successful, this can be lucrative; but the syndicator may only be able to sell the show in a small percentage of the markets.

Syndication differs from selling the show to a television network; once a network picks up a show, it is usually guaranteed to run on all the network's affiliates, on the same day of the week and at the same time (in a given timezone, in countries where this is a concern).  Many production companies create their shows and sell them to networks at a loss, at least at first, hoping that the series will succeed and that eventual off-network syndication will turn a profit for the show.

A syndicated program is sold to stations for "cash" (rights are purchased by the stations to insert some or all of the ads at their level); given to stations for access to airtime (wherein the syndicators get the ad revenue); or the combination of both. The trade of program for airtime is called "barter."  

While market penetration can vary widely and revenues can be unreliable, the producers often enjoy more content-freedom in the absence of network standards and practice officials; frequently, some innovative ideas are explored by first-run syndicated programming, which the networks are leery of giving airtime to.  Meanwhile, top-rated syndicated shows in the United States usually have a domestic market reach of 98%.

It should also be noted that very often series that are aired in syndication are cut. For example a standard American sitcom runs 22 minutes, but in syndication it may be cut back to 20 minutes to make room for more commercials.

Syndication can take the form of either weekly or daily syndication.  The game shows, some "tabloid" and entertainment news shows, and stripped talk shows are broadcast daily or week-daily, while most other first-run syndicated shows are broadcast weekly.

==First-run syndication in the U.S.==
As with radio in the U.S., television networks in their early years particularly didn't offer full-days-worth of programming for their affiliates, even in the evening or "prime time" hours. Also, from the beginning, other stations were not affiliated with any network. Both groups sought to supplement their locally produced programming and whatever network feeds there were with content that could be flexibly scheduled.  The development of videotape and, much later, enhanced satellite downlink access furthered these options. While most past first-run syndicated shows were shown only in syndication, some canceled network shows continued to be produced for first-run syndication or were revived for syndication several years after their original cancellation.   

Highway Patrol''.  Some first-run syndicated series were picked up by networks in the 1950s and early '60s, notably ''The Adventures of Superman'' and ''Mr. Ed''.  The networks started syndicating their reruns in the late 1950s, and first-run syndication shrank sharply, for a decade (CBS's first syndication arm, Viacom, would eventually be split off from the company and eventually come back to purchase CBS, having already purchased Paramount Pictures and its interests, and created UPN).  Some stalwart series continued, notably ''Death Valley Days''; other ambitious projects were also to flourish, however briefly, such as ''The Play of the Week'' (1959&ndash;1961), produced by David Susskind (of the syndicated talk show ''Open End'' and also producer of such network fare as ''NYPD'').

However, FCC rulings in the late 1960s curtailed the U.S. networks' ability to schedule programming in what has become known as the "early fringe," notably the 7-8pm (ET/PT) hour of "prime time," with the stated hope that this might encourage more local programming of social and cultural relevance to communities (off-network syndie repeats were also banned); some projects of this sort came to fruition, though usually relatively commercial and slick ones such as the Evening Magazine''/''PM Magazine'' franchise, and such pre-existing national projects as the brief commercial-television run of William F. Buckley, Jr.'s interview/debate series ''Firing Line''. The more obvious result was a rash of Canadian-produced syndicated dramatic series, such as the ''Gilligan's Island'' knock-off ''Dusty's Trail'' and the Colgate-sponsored ''Dr. Simon Locke''; game shows, often evening editions of network afternoon series, flourished, and a few odd items such as ''Wild Kingdom'', cancelled by NBC in 1971, had a continuing life as syndicated programming tailor-made for the early fringe.

===The 1970s===
Into the 1970s, first-run syndication continued to be an odd mix: cheaply produced, but not always poor-quality, "filler" programming. These included the dance-music show ''Soul Train'', a sports history series, and 20th Century Fox's ''That's Hollywood'', a television variation on the popular ''That's Entertainment!'' theatrically released collections of film clips from the MGM library. 

There were also many imported programs distributed this way. These include the impressive documentary series ''Wild, Wild World of Animals'' (repackaged by Time Life with narration by UFO'' (1970) and ''Thunderbirds''.  The most successful syndicated show in the US in the 1970s was probably the ''The Muppet Show'', also from Lew Grade.

Pyramid'', for example). Of these shows, ''Let's Make a Deal'' and ''The Hollywood Squares'' were the first to jump to twice-a-week syndicated versions around 1973. The night-time version of ''Family Feud'' (1977) quickly jumped from once-weekly to twice, and finally to five-days-a-week, and its massive popularity, along with that of new five-a-day entries like Jack Barry's ''The Joker's Wild'' (1977) and ''Tic Tac Dough'' (1978) and Chuck Barris's increasingly-raunchy remakes of his '60s hits ''The Dating Game'' and ''The Newlywed Game'', brought an end (with rare exceptions) to the era of once-a-week games.  Also popular in first-run syndication and daytime was ''The Gong Show'', hosted by Barris throughout most of its run.

''Wait Till Your Father Gets Home'' (1973) was a Hanna-Barbera cartoon series attempting to ape the ''All in the Family''-style sitcoms; ''Skippy the Bush Kangaroo'' (1969) was an Australian children's series in the manner of ''Flipper'' or ''Gentle Ben'' (a decade later, the decidedly not-for-children Australian ''Prisoner: Cell Block H'' would have a brief US syndicated run); and a Canadian sketch-comedy series began appearing on U.S. television stations in 1977&mdash;''Second City Television'' would eventually find a home, for two seasons, on NBC, as ''SCTV Network 90'' (and on cable station Cinemax later).

The Universal / Paramount-produced package of original programming, ''Operation Prime Time'', began appearing on ''ad hoc'' quasi-networks of (almost by necessity) non-network stations in the U.S. in 1978, with a mini-series adaptation of John Jakes's ''The Bastard''.

From the latter '60s into the late '70s, Westinghouse also found considerable success with ''The Mike Douglas Show'', a variety/talk show hosted by a singer with an easygoing interview style, which played in afternoons in most markets; similar programs soon followed featuring Merv Griffin, who had been the host of CBS's most sustained late-night answer to ''The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' previously, and another network veteran, Dinah Shore.  Also notable was the growing success of audience-participation talk shows, particularly that of the innovator of the format, Phil Donahue.

First-run syndication in the 1970s also made it possible for some shows no longer wanted by network television to remain on the air.  In 1971, ABC cancelled ''The Lawrence Welk Show'', which went on to produce new episodes in syndication for another 11 years.  Also in 1971, Lassie'' and ''Hee Haw'', the latter show's run ending as part of the network's cancellation of all of its rural-oriented shows (see ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' and ''Green Acres'').  ''Lassie'' entered first-run syndication for two years, while ''Hee Haw'' continued to produce new episodes until 1992.

Throughout the mid to late 1980s, sitcoms continued to enter first-run syndication after being cancelled by the networks, the most successful of which were ''Webster'', ''It's a Living'', ''Too Close for Comfort'' and ''What's Happening!!'' (retitled as ''What's Happening Now!!'').  Many of these sitcoms produced new shows in syndication mainly to have enough episodes for a profitable run in rerun syndication.  Other sitcoms, such as ''Small Wonder'', enjoyed success in syndication throughout the entire run.       

====Dramatic first-run syndicated programs====
During the latter 1980s and early 1990s and throughout the remainder of the decade there was a resurgence of dramatic first-run syndicated programs, many of them in the science fiction and fantasy fields, or adventure dramas with fantastic elements. ''War of the Worlds''. ''spin-off series ''FOX series ''VIP'', ''Once a Thief''. In 1997, ''Andromeda'' also premiered in syndication. In 2008, Disney-ABC Domestic Television and ABC Studios are teaming up with Sam Raimi to launch a new first-run syndicated TV series ''Wizard's First Rule'', which is based on Terry Goodkind's ''Sword of Truth'' novel series. It'll be the very first weekly dramatic first-run syndicated program in six years since the fall first-run syndication premiere of ''She Spies'' and also the very first weekly dramatic first-run syndicated program to be shot and available in HDTV.

Shows featuring competition in one form or another, such as ''Star Search'' and ''American Gladiators'', also enjoyed popularity in syndication around this time.  

====News programming====
Also in the 1980s, news programming of various sorts began to be offered widely to stations. ''WPIX studios in ABC's ''FOX's ''A Current Affair'', would become a syndication staple with such series as ''Extra'' and ''Real TV''.

Another area where network dominance was challenged by syndicated programming in the 1980s was in late-night talk shows; ''The Magic Hour'' was seen as a massive flop.

====Reality and children's shows====
As UPN and the WB began offering their affiliates ever-more nights of primetime programming, less call has been felt for first-run drama, at least, in the U.S.; much as with the closing of windows that provided opportunity for Ziv in the '50s and various producers in the early '70s. The more expensive dramatic projects are less attractive to syndicators (particularly when they might be sold, with somewhat less risk, to cable channels); "reality" series such as ''FCC enforcement of rules on children's programming.

====Game Shows====
Several Wheel of Fortune'' and the latest incarnation of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'', premiering in 2002. New game show concepts (that is, not based on an existing or pre-existing format) are rarely tried and usually unsuccessful in syndication; ''Temptation'' and ''Merv Griffin's Crosswords'' helped stop that streak, bringing the daytime tally to six game shows. More new shows are slated for fall-2008 and 2009, including a daytime run of ''Deal or No Deal'' and an adaptation of the popular board game Trivial Pursuit.
