'''Julius "Julie" Schwartz''' (1915 – 2004) was a editor, and a agent and prominent fan. He was born in the Bronx, New York. He is best known as a longtime editor at DC Comics, where at various times he was primary editor over the company's flagship superheroes, Superman and Batman.

He was inducted into the comics industry's Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1996 and the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1997.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
In 1932, Schwartz co-published (with Time Traveller'', one of the first science fiction Alfred Bester, Stanley G. Weinbaum, Robert Bloch, Ray Bradbury, and H. P. Lovecraft, including some of Bradbury's first published work and Lovecraft's last. In addition, Schwartz helped organize the first World Science Fiction Convention in 1939.

In 1944 he became an editor at the Flash, the Atom, which led to the Silver Age of comic books. This revival has been cited as an inspiration for the transformation of Marvel Comics in the 1960s. The Schwartz-edited line of titles was regarded by many as being more creative and dynamic than other DC titles of the time, notably the ''Superman'' line edited by Mort Weisinger.

===Silver Age of Comic Books===
In the 1960s, during the period fans and historians calls the mid-1950s and 1960s "New Look" Batman that premiered in ''Detective Comics'' #327 (May 1964). He also helped writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams come to prominence at DC Comics.  

From 1971 to 1985 Schwartz was the editor of the ''Superman'' titles, helping to modernize the settings of the books and move them away from "gimmick" stories to stories with more of a character-driven nature. This included an attempt to scale back Superman's powers while removing kryptonite as an overused plot device. This proved short-lived, with Schwartz bowing to pressure to restore both elements in the titles.

As an editor, Schwartz was heavily involved in the writing of the stories published in his magazines. He worked out the plot with the writer in story conferences. The writer would then break down the plot into a panel-by-panel continuity, and write the dialogue and captions. Schwartz would in turn polish the script, sometimes rewriting extensively.

===Later life and career===
Schwartz retired from DC in 1986 after 42 years at the company, but continued to be active in comics and science fiction fandom until shortly before his death. As a coda to his career as a comic book editor, Schwartz edited seven DC science fiction graphic novels, adapted from classic science fiction works by Harlan Ellison, Robert Silverberg, Bradbury, and others. In 2000 he published his autobiography, ''Man of Two Worlds: My Life in Science Fiction and Comics'', co-authored with Brian Thomsen.

His wife, Jean (who had been his secretary before they married), died in 1986 from emphysema, after 34 years of marriage. Schwartz's relationship with Jean had been particularly close, and he never remarried or dated following her death. Not many years later, Schwartz's stepdaughter Jeanne — Jean's daughter from a previous marriage — died from the same illness under similar circumstances.

Schwartz died at the age of 88, after being hospitalized for pneumonia. He was survived by his son-in-law, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, whom he encouraged to refer to him not as "Great-Grandpa" but as "Super-Grandpa".

He remained a "Goodwill Ambassador" for DC Comics and an Editor Emeritus up until his death.<ref>[http://www.orcafresh.net/Comicons/pcc/julius.html Orcafresh]</ref> He was a popular guest at comic book conventions, often attending between ten and twelve conventions a year.

== Biographie ==
En 1932, Schwartz a co-publié (avec Time Traveller'', un des premiers H. P. Lovecraft pour ses derniers. De plus, Schwartz a aidé à la création de la première World Science Fiction Convention en 1939.

En 1944, il intègre All-American Comics, le futur '''DC Comics'''. Il embaucha Bester afin qu'il participe à la rédaction des comics. Dans les années 50 il a relancé des Flash, Atom, ce qui sera le départ de l'âge d'argent des comics. Ce revival est peut-être même à l'origine des changements effectués au sein de Marvel Comics dans les années 60. Les titres édités par Schwartz avaient la réputation d'être les plus dynamiques et les plus créatifs du catalogue DC.

Dans les années 60, Schwartz commença à éditer les titres ''Batman''. Il participa au "relooking" de ce dernier. C'est aussi grâce à lui que Dennis O'Neil et Neal Adams rejoignèrent DC Comics.

De 1971 à 1985, Schwartz fut le responsable des titres ''Superman''. Il changea l'orientation de la série, lui donnant un côté psychologique plus prononcé. 

Schwartz ne se cantonnait pas à son seul rôle d'éditeur, mais participait activement à l'orientation des scénarios et écrivait la plupart des dialogues.
