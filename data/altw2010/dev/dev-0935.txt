'''Lukas Podolski''' () (born as  on Gliwice, Poland nicknamed ''(Prinz) Poldi'', is a Polish born, German footballer who plays as a Bayern Munich and is a member of the German national team.

==Early life==

Podolski was born to Krystyna Podolski, a former member of the Polish national handball team and Waldemar Podolski, former Polish football professional and the Upper Silesian industrial town of ethnic Germans (''Aussiedler''). <ref>[http://www.gfdb.com/Player.6636.Lukas-Podolski.aspx Lukas Podolski], GFDb.com</ref> Podolski grew up in Bergheim, North Rhine-Westphalia, and later in Pulheim, both near Cologne.<ref></ref>

== Career ==
=== Club career ===
==== 1. FC Köln ====
Podolski began playing football at the age of six in the youth team of FC Bergheim, where he played until he joined Köln in 1995. It was there where Podolski's talents were first noticed. In Bundesliga. First team boss 2nd division, Podolski had shown what he could do, scoring 10 goals in his first 19 senior appearances. This was the best tally by an 18 year old in the history of the Bundesliga. 

Though his call up to the German Euro 2004 squad brought along interest from several top clubs, Podolski stayed at Köln to help the club gain promotion in the 2004-05 season. With 24 goals, Podolski advanced to become the league's best scorer. Somewhat unusually, Podolski remained part of the Germany squad, even though he did not play in the national top tier league. 

After Köln were promoted, the pressure was on Podolski to keep the club in the Bundesliga practically singlehandedly. Podolski managed to score 12 goals in the 2005-06 season, but eventually, Köln were relegated again. It became clear that Podolski would not stay again to push them through the 2006-07 season - even more so, as Podolski was becoming an integral part of the national team.

==== Bayern Munich ====
In 2006, clubs such as Bayern Munich, Hamburg, FC Köln through 2007. On equaliser, evening the match 1:1. On Hertha Berlin. On October 26, 2006, Podolski suffered a serious injury to his right ankle joint caused by teammate, Mark van Bommel, during a training session. Consequently, Podolski missed more than five matchweeks. He returned from this injury and scored against Alemannia Aachen.

=== International career ===
In late 2003 after a couple of impressive performances in his first few Bundesliga games, Polish media suggested then-Polish national team coach Paweł Janas to check Podolski out, as he was still eligible to play for Poland. Janas ignored the request stating in one of the press interviews that "as for today we have much better strikers in Poland and I don't see a reason to call up a player just because he played one or two good matches in the Bundesliga. He's not even a regular starter at his club." By that time Podolski was still interested in representing Poland, but as the season progressed more and more German media started to suggest to call up the striker to their national team. When his full potential was finally unveiled, he had already been persuaded to represent Germany. At the end of the season Köln were relegated, but Podolski impressed so much, that he celebrated his debut for Rudi Völler's Germany on June 6, 2004 in Kaiserslautern against Hungary with a late substitute appearance. He had become the first second-division player since 1975 to break into the national team.

==== Euro 2004 ====
Podolski played for Germany at Euro 2004, where he was the squad's youngest player. He made one substitute appearance in the game against the Czech Republic, when he came on for Torsten Frings at half-time.

==== World Cup 2006 ====
Podolski was selected in the Germany squad for the 2006 World Cup, where he partnered Ecuador, and both goals in the 2-0 win over Sweden in the round of 16. By this, he became the first player since Best Young Player for his performance in the tournament.

On Euro 2008 qualifying game against San Marino, which made him only third German after Serravalle was 0-13. In Germany's 4-1 win against Slovakia in Euro qualifier match against Cyprus, Podolski was involved in every goal in Germany's 4-0 victory. This was one of Podolski's best performances for the German national team. Even though he played out of his natural position, playing at left midfield, he netted one goal himself and was voted Man of the Match.

==== Euro 2008 ====
On Sunday Euro 2008 entrance against debutants Poland in a Group B match in Spain against Russia. <ref>[http://en.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/matches/match=300685/report=rp.html Germany vs Poland match report]</ref>

On Croatia in their second Group B match, again in Klagenfurt. Podolski scored the German team's only goal of the game in the 79th minute, by which time the Croatians were already leading 2-0. He did not celebrate this goal either despite it putting him joint first on the Euro 2008 goal-scoring list with David Villa. Podolski's goal was not enough to snatch a draw, with Croatia holding out for a 2-1 victory over Germany.<ref>[http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/matches/match=300693/report=rp.html Croatia vs Germany match report]</ref> On Portugal in the quarterfinal in Basel, Podolski was instrumental in the first goal, whipping a cross into the penalty box that slotted home by Bastian Schweinsteiger in the 22nd minute to give Germany a 1-0 lead.

On the international scene, Podolski seems to be gravitating towards an attacking left midfield role from his traditional place as a striker. He resumed this position in the final of the Euro 08, but was unable to prevent Germany losing 1-0 to Spain. In a controversial incident, Podolski was headbutted by Spanish midfielder David Silva, although this went unnoticed by the referee and his assistants, and went unpenalised. Lukas Podolski was named in the 23 man squad as one of the players of the tournament along with countrymen Michael Ballack and Philipp Lahm.
