Đại học Leiden là thành viên của các nhóm: Coimbra Group, Europaeum và Liên hiệp các trường đại học nghiên cứu châu Âu. Trường Đại học Leiden được thành lập năm 1575 bởi William I của Oranje-Nassau, thủ lĩnh của cuộc khởi nghĩa Chiến tranh 80 năm.

==History==
thumb|350px|left|The Academy building of the Leiden university
In 1575, the emerging Prince William founded the first Dutch university in Leiden as a reward for the heroic defence of Leiden against Spanish attacks in the previous year. Ironically, the name of Philip II of Spain, William's adversary, appears on the official foundation certificate, as he was still the ''de jure'' count of Holland. It is traditionally said that the citizens of Leiden were offered the choice between a university and a certain exemption from taxes, and that the citizens believed that a tax law could be rescinded, whereas the great universities of Europe had survived for many centuries. Originally located in the convent of St Barbara, the university moved to the convent of the White Nuns in 1581, a site which it still occupies, though the original building was destroyed in 1616.

The presence within half a century of the date of its foundation of such scholars as Joseph Scaliger, Hugo Grotius, Jacobus Arminius, Daniel Heinsius and Gerhard Johann Vossius, at once raised Leiden university to the highest European fame, a position which the learning and reputation of Jacobus Gronovius, Herman Boerhaave, Tiberius Hemsterhuis and David Ruhnken, among others, enabled it to maintain down to the end of the 18th century.

At the end of the nineteenth century, Leiden University again became one of Europe's leading universities. At the world’s first university low-temperature laboratory, professor liquifying helium and can be credited with the discovery of the superconductivity in metals. 

Kamerlingh Onnes was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1913. Three other professors received the Nobel Prize for their research performed at Universiteit Leiden: Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman received the Nobel Prize for their pioneering work in the field of optical and electronic phenomena, and the physiologist Willem Einthoven for his invention of the string galvanometer, which among other things, enabled the development of electrocardiography.

These Nobel prize winners, but also the physicists Einstein on the quantum theory of the monatomic ideal gas (the Einstein-Bose condensation) was discovered in one of Leiden's libraries.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4170212.stm BBC NEWS | Europe | Student unearths Einstein paper<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

At present, Leiden has a firmly established international position among the top research institutes in many fields, including the natural sciences, medicine, social and behavioural sciences, law, arts and letters. Of the twenty-eight Spinozapremie (the highest scientific award of The Netherlands), seven were granted to professors of the Universiteit Leiden. Literary historian Frits van Oostrom was the first professor of Leiden to be granted the Spinoza award for his work on developing the NLCM centre (Dutch literature and culture in the Middle Ages) into a top research centre. Other Spinozapremie winners are linguist Frits Kortlandt, mathematician Hendrik Lenstra and Carlo Beenakker, who works in the field of mesoscopic physics. Among other leading professors are Ewine van Dishoeck, professor of astronomy at Leiden Observatory, professor of transplantation biology Els Goulmy, Frits Rosendaal, professor of clinical epidemiology, Wim Blockmans, professor of Medieval History, and Willem Adelaar, professor of Amerindian Languages.

The portraits of many famous Niebuhr called it, in the history of science. The University Library, which has more than 3.5 million books and fifty thousand journals, also has a number of special collections of western and oriental manuscripts, printed books, archives, maps, and atlases. Scholars from all over the world visit Scaliger Institute concentrate on the various aspects of the transmission of knowledge and ideas through texts and images from antiquity to the present day. 

Among the institutions affiliated with the university are The observatory 1633; the natural history museum, with a very complete anatomical cabinet; the museum of antiquities (''Museum van Oudheden''), with specially valuable anatomical and pathological laboratories of the university are modern, and the museums of geology and mineralogy have been restored.

The Hortus Botanicus (botanical garden) is the oldest botanical garden in the Netherlands. Plants from all over the world have been carefully cultivated here by experts for more than four centuries. The Clusius garden (a reconstruction), the 18th century Orangery with its monumental tub plants, the rare collection of historical trees hundreds of years old, the Japanese Siebold Memorial Museum symbolising the historical link between East and West, the tropical greenhouses with their world class plant collections, and the central square and Conservatory exhibiting exotic plants from South Africa and southern Europe.

Research at Leiden is well developed. There are many university research institutes and Leiden participates in over forty nation-wide research schools, twelve of which being located in the heart of Leiden.

==The institution==
The university has no central campus; its buildings are spread over the city. Some buildings, like the Gravensteen, are very old, while buildings like Lipsius and Gorlaeus are much more modern. The university is divided into nine major faculties which offer approximately 50 undergraduate degree programs and over 100 graduate programs.

The Faculty of Creative and Performing Arts is a cooperation between Leiden University and the Royal Conservatoire and Royal Academy of Art. The university has never had a faculty of economics, business or management, since all these decades one thought this would not fit into its tradition. Yet, in 2002 The Leiden School of Management (LUSM) <ref>[http://www.lusm.leidenuniv.nl/ Homepage LUSM<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> was founded, offering six professional MSc in ICT in Business.<ref>[http://www.iib.leidenuniv.nl/ M.Sc.
