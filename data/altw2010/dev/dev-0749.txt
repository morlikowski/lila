'''Anfield''' is an Anfield, in 4-star rated stadium and has hosted many international matches at the senior level, including England matches. The ground was also used as a venue during Euro 96. Earlier in its history the stadium was also used as a venue for different events, such as boxing and tennis matches.

The stadium currently comprises four stands; Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. This happened before the ground was converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994: a change which greatly reduced its capacity. Each of its four stands now have an all-seater layout following the recommendations of the Taylor Report. Notable features of the stadium include two gates named after former Liverpool managers: the Bob Paisley Gate and the Bill Shankly gate. In addition, a statue of Shankly is situated outside the stadium. 

Anfield's rail and parking facilities. There are plans to replace Anfield with a new stadium in Stanley Park which would hold around 25,000&nbsp;more spectators than Anfield's current capacity. The site is near the current stadium and its construction would lead to Anfield's demolition. The opening of the new stadium is scheduled for 2011 but the state of the financial market and disagreement between the club's American co-owners makes this doubtful.<ref name=StanleyParkDoubts>  </ref>

==History==
Opened in 1884, Anfield was originally owned by John Orrell, a brewer and friend of Everton, who had recently been banned from playing in Liverpool Association Football Club, and their first match at Anfield was played on Rotherham Town, which they won 7&ndash;0.<ref name="YNWA"></ref>

Liverpool's first league match at Anfield was played on Lincoln City, with Liverpool winning 4&ndash;0 in front of 5,000&nbsp;spectators. A new stand was constructed in 1895, capable of seating 3,000&nbsp;spectators, and was built on the site of the present Main Stand. The stand had a distinctive red and white Newcastle United's ground 1906, a new stand was built along the Walton Breck Road. Local Echo'', christened it the Spion Kop. It was named after a famous hill in South Africa where a local regiment had suffered heavy losses during the Boer War in 1900. More than 300&nbsp;men had died, many of them from Liverpool, as the British army attempted to capture the strategic hilltop. Around the same period a stand was also built along Kemlyn Road.<ref name="YNWA"/>

The ground remained much the same until 1928 when the Kop was redesigned and extended to seat 30,000&nbsp;spectators, with a roof erected as well. Many stadiums in England had stands named after the Spion Kop, however Anfield's was the largest Kop in the country at the time. It was able to hold more supporters than some entire football grounds. The topmast of the SS Great Eastern, one of the first iron ships, was rescued from the ship breaking yard at nearby Rock Ferry, and was hauled up the Everton Valley by a team of horses to be erected alongside the new Kop where it still stands today, serving as a flag pole.<ref name="YNWA"/>

Coloured seats and a police-room were added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1987. In 1989, after the function suites as well as 11,000&nbsp;seating spaces. Plans to expand the stand had been made earlier, but two elderly residents living in Kemlyn Road refused to move out of their house and the plans were put on hold. When one of the residents died the other decided to move out and the expansion plans were put into action.<ref name="liverweb" /> The stand was officially opened on UEFA president Lennart Johansson and re-named the Centenary Stand. The Kop was rebuilt in 1994 after the recommendations of the Taylor Report and became all seated; although it is still a single tier, the capacity was significantly reduced to 12,390.<ref name="liverweb" />

On 1999&ndash;2000 season a series of support poles and Ronnie Moran's testimonial against Celtic many fans complained of movement of the top tier. At the same time that the stanchions were inserted the executive seating area was expanded by two rows in the main stand, lowering the capacity for seating in the paddock.<ref name="liverweb"/>

The pitch is surrounded by four all-seater stands, the Anfield Road end, the Centenary Stand, the Kop and the Main Stand, all of which are covered. The Anfield Road end and Centenary Stand are multi-tiered, whilst the Kop and Main Stand are single-tiered. Entry to the stadium is gained by radio-frequency identification (RFID) smart cards rather than the traditional manned turnstile. This system, used in all 80&nbsp;turnstiles around Anfield, was introduced in 2005.<ref></ref>

The Centenary Stand was originally named the Kemlyn Road stand before the addition of a second tier. After the expansion was complete, the stand was renamed to mark the club's hundredth anniversary. The capacity of the stand is 11,762, with 4,600&nbsp;spaces on the upper tier and 6,814 on the lower tier, while 348 spaces are also available in the executive boxes within the stand.<ref name="liverweb">{{cite web|url=http://www.liverweb.org.uk/virtual.htm

Above the stairs that lead down to the pitch hangs a sign stating "THIS IS ANFIELD". Its purpose is to both intimidate the opposition and to bring those who touch it good luck. Accordingly, Liverpool players and coaching staff reach up and place one or both hands on it as they pass underneath.<ref name="This is Anfield"></ref>

'''Anfield''' est l'un des deux stades majeurs de Liverpool FC. Sa capacité actuelle est de 45 362 places, toutes assises.

L'enceinte d'Anfield, située sur Anfield Road, est inaugurée le Everton. Les Blues d'Everton quittent Anfield en mars 1892 suite à une scission qui donne naissance au Liverpool FC, tandis qu'Everton fait bâtir un stade flambant neuf : Goodison Park. 

Le stade compte 18 à 20 000 places quand Everton y évolue, et il faut attendre 1905-1906 pour voir les premiers travaux d'envergures à Anfield. L'architecte écossais Archibald Leitch les signe. La nouvelle enceinte est inaugurée le  1906 devant 32 000 spectateurs.

La tribune la plus mythique de ce stade de légende est incontestablement le Kop, ou plutôt le Spion Kop, du nom d'une colline ou se déroula une bataille de la guerre en Afrique du Sud en janvier 1900. Les historiens britanniques ont identifié deux tribunes surnommées Spion Kop avant que ce terme n'entre en usage à Liverpool : à Arsenal et à Birmingham. C'est le journaliste Ernest Edwards qui surnomme ainsi la tribune d'Anfield le 29 septembre 1904 dans un article du ''Liverpool Daily Post'' présentant le derby Liverpool-Everton. Cette tribune accueille jusqu'à 28 000 spectateurs après les travaux de 1928. La nouvelle tribune est inaugurée le 28 août 1928.

Le record d'affluence à Anfield est enregistré le Liverpool FC aux Wolverhampton Wanderers FC : 61 905 spectateurs. Le stade est équipé d'un système d'éclairage pour les matches en nocturne en octobre 1957.

Suite à des incidents en décembre 1966 au cours desquels les services médicaux sont incapables de se frayer un chemin parmi la foule compacte du kop, la capacité est réduite de 28 à 20 000 puis à 16 480 après le drame du Heysel (1985). Après le drame de Sheffield qui condamne définitivement les places debouts, le kop ne comprend que des places assises depuis 1994 (12.409 places).

Le tunnel d'accès des joueurs comporte une pancarte accrochée par le mythique entraineur des Reds, Bill Shankly : « ''This is Anfield'' ».

Le stade comprend une stèle à la mémoire des 96 victimes de la tragédie d'Hillsborough. Cette stèle se trouve à côté du portail d'accès au Kop, où figure en fer forgé la devise « ''You'll never walk alone'' ».
