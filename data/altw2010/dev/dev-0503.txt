'''''Masters of the Universe''''' is a 1987 toy line by the same name. The movie stars Dolph Lundgren as He-Man and Frank Langella as Skeletor. Other actors include Jon Cypher as Man-At-Arms, Chelsea Field as Teela and Billy Barty as Gwildor, the short ''Thenorian'' inventor/locksmith. 

The film was released in the 1987 after the popularity of the toy line and cartoon had peaked.

==Production==

The character of Gwildor was introduced to replace Blade as the latter character utters at one point, "I've been waiting a long time for this." However due to the character's limited screen time this subplot was never explored.

The character of She-Ra, He-Man's twin sister, was originally going to feature in the movie, and concept designs were drawn for her costume. However, she never made it into any drafts of the screenplay. The original draft was written in late 1985, right around the time She-Ra was launching. Earlier drafts of the script reveal that the Eternians are descendants of Earthlings, and feature a NASA space probe and US flag being found in the vaults of Castle Grayskull, prompting the explanation that human life arrived on Eternia when it was colonized by a space exploration team from Earth's future. This scene appears in the comic adaptation of the movie. The final battle between He-Man and Skeletor was financed entirely on Gary Goddard's own money, after studio bosses cancelled funding prior to the movie's completion. As a result, Goddard was unable to make the final battle as elaborate as he had originally intended. In the final portion of the fight between Skeletor and He-Man after the Havoc Staff is destroyed, Skeletor unsheathes and proceeds to duel with a virtually identical sword to He-Man's. Although no explicit point is made about this in the film, it would seem to be an obvious reference to the concept from the original toyline that He-Man and Skeletor each possessed one "half" of the Power Sword, coloured grey and purple respectively. Skeletor's quest to possess both halves, which form the key to Castle Grayskull, was his major ongoing motivation in the earliest MOTU minicomics and DC comics, but was largely ignored in the more well-known Filmation cartoon's continuity. As Skeletor's costume was changed from purple to black in the film, his sword accordingly reflects this change in his colour scheme as well.  The concept of a sword whose halves were each possessed by two enemies had previously been used in the ''BlackStar'' toy line and cartoon, which had also been produced by Filmation, with something similar appearing in Michael Moorcock's stories about Elric, a part of his larger Multiverse mythology. Dolph Lundgren was the first actor cast for the film, after Sylvester Stallone refused an offer to star as He-Man, while Frank Langella was the last actor cast for the film. 

===Adaptation===
As with most film adaptations of serialised fiction like cartoons and comic books, the movie  does not follow the continuity of the thumb|right|300px|Gwildor with the movie versions of Man-At-Arms and Teela.  -->Furthermore, Skeletor is depicted as having a large army of apparently robotic black-armored soldiers at his command, something entirely unprecedented for MOTU's primary villain. This allows him to conquer Eternia primarily due to his military prowess rather than via elaborate mystical plans as is his modus operandi in other depictions. In addition, He-Man uses laser guns in some scenes, which He-Man never does in the Filmation animated series, although the original toyline and minicomics include several gun-themed accessories that He-Man uses, such as in the minicomic ''The Fastest Draw in the Universe''.

In the film, Teela is shocked and appalled at the discovery that the people on Earth consume meat, which she sees as "barbaric", when meat is consumed in the series by characters including King Randor, with no indication that Teela is disturbed by it. There is no mention of Teela being the daughter of the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull.

Other examples of differences in the adaptation include Moebius, including the Power Sword and Castle Grayskull.

==Plot==
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: thumb|left|300px|[[Dolph Lundgren as He-Man]] -->
The movie begins on the world of Sorceress (Christina Pickles) is now Skeletor's prisoner and he begins to drain her life-force as he waits for the moon of Eternia to align with the Great Eye of the Universe that will bestow god-like power upon him.

He-Man and his friends, still at large, free Gwildor and discover that he still has a working prototype of the key. They break into Grayskull and attempt to free the Sorceress but as they are surrounded by Skeletor's soldiers, Gwildor randomly opens a portal to Earth, allowing He-Man and his friends to escape. On Earth, the team split up to search for the misplaced key, which has been discovered by a pair of teenagers named Julie (Courteney Cox) and Kevin (Robert Duncan McNeill). Unfortunately Skeletor is close behind. Though it has never been said officially in the movie where on Earth He-Man and his friends landed, and no clear indications or hints were made in any scene obvious to all as to where they could possibly be, the director Gary Goddard during the commentary of the film on DVD confirmed indirectly that they are to be somewhere in Los Angeles, California.

The movie features a few of Skeletor's better known lackeys, mainly Evil-Lyn (Karg (Blade (Anthony De Longis), a dual-sword wielding warrior.

'''''I dominatori dell'universo''''' (''Masters of the Universe'') è un film fantastico, basato sulla linea di giocattoli de i Masters of the Universe; Dolph Lundgren interpreta il ruolo di He-Man e Frank Langella quello di Skeletor. Altri protagonisti sono: Jon Cypher (''Man-At-Arms''), Chelsea Field (''Teela'') e Billy Barty (''Gwildor'').

Sylvester Stallone ricevette la proposta di interpretare la parte di He-Man ma la rifiutò, e fu probabilmente lui a proporre al posto suo Dolph Lundgren con il quale aveva recentemente lavorato in Rocky IV.
