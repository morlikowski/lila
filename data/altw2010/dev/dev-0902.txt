'''Khmer''' (Austroasiatic language, with speakers in the tens of millions. Khmer has been considerably influenced by Pali, especially in the royal and religious registers, through the vehicles of Mon and by a significant margin Vietnamese.  As a result of geographic proximity, the Khmer language has affected, and also been affected by, Thai, Lao, Vietnamese and Cham which all form a sprachbund in peninsular Southeast Asia.<ref name ="cl"></ref>

Khmer has its own script, an Aksar Khmer.

Khmer differs from neighboring languages such as Thai, Lao and Vietnamese in that it is not a tonal language.  All its main dialects that are mutually intelligible: 
*'''Battambang''', spoken in northern Cambodia.
*'''Phnom Penh''', the capital dialect and is also spoken in surrounding provinces.
*'''Northern Khmer''', also known as ''Khmer Surin'', spoken by ethnic Khmer native to Northeast Thailand
*'''Khmer Krom''' or '''Southern Khmer''', spoken by the indigenous Khmer population of the Mekong Delta.
*'''Cardamom Khmer''', an archaic form spoken by a small population in the Cardamom Mountains of western Cambodia.<ref></ref>

==History==
Linguistic study of the Khmer language divides its history into four periods.<ref name="SIDWELL">[http://www.anu.edu.au/~u9907217/languages/Khmer-Cambodian.html Mon-Khmer Studies] Paul Sidwell. Australian National University. Accessed February 23, 2007.</ref>  Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the language after its divergence from Proto-Mon-Khmer until the ninth century, is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era.  Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the morphology, phonology and lexicon. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese.  The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand the Old Khmer.  The language became recognizable as the Modern Khmer spoken today in the 19th century.<ref name="SIDWELL" />

Khmer is classified as a member of the Eastern branch of the Mon-Khmer language family, itself a subdivision of the larger Austro-Asiatic language group, which has representatives in a large swath of land from Northeast India down through Southeast Asia to the Malay Peninsula and its islands.  As such, its closest relatives are the languages of the Pearic, Bahnaric, and Katuic families spoken by the hill tribes of the region.<ref name="Shorto">Shorto, Harry L. edited by Sidwell, Paul, Cooper, Doug and Bauer, Christian (2006). ''A Mon-Khmer comparative dictionary''. Canberra: Australian National University. Pacific Linguistics. ISBN 0-85883-570-3</ref> The Vietic languages have also been classified as belonging to this family.

==Phonology==
As described by Huffman, modern standard Khmer has the following consonant and vowel phonemes.<ref name="HUFF">Huffman, Franklin. 1970. ''[http://www.pratyeka.org/csw/hlp-csw.pdf Cambodian System of Writing and Beginning Reader]''. Yale University Press. ISBN 0-300-01314-0</ref> The phonological system described here is the inventory of sounds of the spoken language, not how they are written in the Khmer alphabet. 

===Consonants===
{| class="wikitable"
! || Labial|| Coronal|| Palatal || Velar|| Glottal
|-
!Aspirated plosive
| ||  ||  ||  ||
|-
!Unaspirated plosive
| ||  ||  ||  || 
|-
!Implosive
| ||  || || ||
|-
!Nasal
|  ||  ||  ||  ||
|-
!Liquid
| ||   || || ||
|-
!Fricative
| ||  || || || 
|-
!Approximant
|  || ||  || ||
|-
|}

The consonants , ,  and  may occasionally occur in foreign words from, for example, French and other recent introductions. These consonants do not appear in the chart above because they are not Khmer consonants per se and the sounds do not occur in any Khmer words. These non-native sounds are only heard by speakers familiar with the originating language and have no corresponding symbol in the Khmer script, although combinations of letters otherwise unpronounceable are used to represent these sounds when necessary. In the speech of those who are not bilingual, these sounds are approximated with natively occurring phonemes:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
! Foreign Sound (IPA)
! Khmer Representation
! Khmer Approximation (IPA)
|- 
| 
| ហ្គ
| 
|- 
| 
| ហ្ស
| 
|- 
| 
| ហ្វ
|  or 
|- 
| 
| ហ្ស
| 
|}

===Vowel nuclei===
{| class="wikitable"
!Long vowels
|  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || 
|-
!Short vowels
|  ||  || ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||
|-
!Long diphthongs
| ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || 
|-
!Short diphthongs
| ||  || || || || || ||  ||  ||
|}
The precise number and the phonetic value of vowel nuclei vary from dialect to dialect.<ref name="SIDWELL" />  Short and long vowels of equal quality are distinguished solely by duration.

===Syllable structure===
Khmer words are predominantly of one or two syllables. There are 85 possible clusters of two consonants at the beginning of syllables and two three-consonant clusters with phonetic alterations as shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
! ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || 
|-
!
| || || - || - ||  || - || - || || - || - || - || - || - || - || -|| ||
|-

|-
|}

Syllables begin with one of these consonants or consonant clusters, followed by one of the vowel nuclei. When the vowel nucleus is short, there has to be a final consonant.  can exist in a syllable coda.  and  become  and  respectively. The most common word structure in Khmer is a full syllable as described above, preceded by an unstressed, “minor” syllable that has a consonant-vowel (CV) structure CV-, CrV-, CVN- or CrVN- (N is any nasal in the Khmer inventory). Words can also be made up of two full syllables. The vowel in these preceding syllables is usually reduced in conversation to , however in careful or formal speech and in TV and radio, they are always clearly articulated.

Words with three or more syllables exist, particularly those pertaining to science, the arts, and religion. These words are loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French.

==Grammar==

Khmer is generally a derivation by means of prefixes and infixes is common.<ref name = "cc""></ref> Adjectives, demonstratives and numerals follow their noun:

ស្រីស្អាតនោះ    (girl pretty that) = that pretty girl 

The noun has no grammatical gender or singular/plural distinction. Plurality can be marked by postnominal particles, numerals, or by doubling the adjective, which can also serve to intensify the adjective:

ឆ្កែធំ   (dog large) = large dog

ឆ្កែធំណាស់    (dog large very) = large dogs or a very large dog

ឆ្កែពីរ   (dog two) = two dogs
