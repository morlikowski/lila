}}'''''The Colbert Report''''' (&mdash;the Ts are silent in "Colbert" and "Report") is an American satirical CTV in FX each Tuesday through Friday. It stars political humorist Stephen Colbert, a former correspondent for ''The Daily Show''.

''The Colbert Report'' is a satirizes personality-driven political pundit programs, particularly Stephen Colbert, a fictional anchorman character played by Colbert. The character, described by Colbert as a "well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot", is a caricature of televised political pundits.<ref name="NYTIMES25Q"></ref><ref name="NewsweekTruthinessTeller"></ref>

''The Colbert Report'' was nominated for four Emmys each in 2006 and 2007, two Television Critics Association Awards, and two Satellite Awards. It received a Special Recognition award at the 2007 GLAAD Media Awards. It has been presented as non-satirical journalism in several instances, by the Tom DeLay Legal Defense Trust, and following Robert Wexler's interview on the program. ''The Report'' received considerable media coverage following its debut on October 17, 2005, for Colbert's popularizing of the term "truthiness", which dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster named its 2006 "Word of the Year".<ref name="mw"></ref>

''The Report'' has had cultural influence in a number of ways. In 2006, after Colbert encouraged viewers to vote online to name a Hungarian bridge after him, he won the first round of voting with 17,231,724 votes.<ref name=First_round></ref> The Ambassador of the Republic of Hungary presented Mr. Colbert with a declaration certifying him as the winner of the second and final round of voting, though it was later announced that the bridge would be named the Megyeri Bridge. In 2007, the Democratic Caucus chair instructed freshmen not to appear on the show's 'Better Know a District' segment.<ref name="The Hill"></ref> ''The Report'' has also coined several neologisms, such as "freem" and "truthiness".

==Production==
thumb|right|[[Stephen Colbert|Colbert on "''The Colbert Gang''"]]In 2004, ''Bill O'Reilly. Jon Stewart's production company, Busboy Productions, developed ''The Report''. Colbert, Stewart, and Karlin pitched the idea of the show (reportedly with one phrase: "our version of ''The O'Reilly Factor'' with Stephen Colbert") to Comedy Central chief Doug Herzog, who agreed to run the show for eight weeks without creating a pilot.<ref name="USATodayLevin"></ref>

''The Colbert Report'' first appeared in the form of three ratings for the show's first two weeks, Comedy Central and Colbert announced they had signed for an additional year, through the end of 2006.<ref></ref>

===Program format===

Typically, Colbert starts each episode with teasers regarding the show's topics and guest, followed by a verbal button-hook to the left. I'm going to hit you with a perfect spiral of the truth. This is ''The Colbert Report''." The show's opening title sequence begins with images of flag waving, Colbert striking poses and words describing Colbert flying by that have been used as the word. Originally, the last word was ''grippy'', but it has changed to ''megamerican'', ''Lincolnish'', ''superstantial'', ''freem'', ''eneagled'', ''flagaphile'', ''good'', ''gutly'', ''warrior-poet'', ''President Bush have a hotdog with me'', ''Self-Evident'' (for the week of  Rush's first televised performance in more than thirty years), and ''Multi-grain'' (as of July 21st, 2008). The sequence ends with a computer-generated shrieking eagle swooping toward the foreground.

Following the opening sequence, Colbert proceeds a run-through of the day's headlines, similar to that of ''The Daily Show'' but with a pseudo-right-wing spin. The program proper then begins with Colbert addressing a specific topic. That topic will usually lead into a "The Wørd" segment, which juxtaposes Colbert's commentary with satirical bullet points on-screen, a parody on ''The O'Reilly Factor'''s "Talking Points Memo;"<ref></ref> though on occasion he will conduct a short interview with someone having to do with the topic. The format of the middle segment varies, but it is normally a visual presentation or skit. Often, these skits are parts of recurring segments, which may include "U.S. Representative from a certain district of the United States; "Tip of the Hat/Wag of the Finger", in which Colbert voices his approval or disapproval of prominent people and news items; "Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A.", a health segment; "The ThreatDown", in which Colbert lists the five greatest threats to America, and others.

Sometimes, there is a "''Colbert Report Special Repor-t''" (final "t" pronounced with special emphasis), in which Colbert devotes a section of an episode, and sometimes the entire episode to a special subject. The third segment is almost always an interview with a celebrity guest, often an author or government official.<ref></ref> The interview is, unlike ''The Daily Show'', conducted at a different table on the set. Viewers applaud as Colbert hammily jogs from his desk to the interview area, where his guest awaits. This is different from the traditional format, in which the guest enters to applause and joins the already seated host. Afterwards, Colbert ends the show by giving some parting words to the audience.200px|thumb|right|[[Stephen Colbert|Colbert on the set of ''The Colbert Report''. Note the three instances of the show's title.]]

===Set===
The studio in which ''The Colbert Report'' is taped was used for ''The Daily Show'' until July 2005. The set for ''The Colbert Report'' is called "The Eagle's Nest" and reflects and facilitates Colbert's self-aggrandizing style.<ref name="Linda"></ref> The set has two main areas: the desk, from which Colbert hosts most of the show, and the guest interview area to camera right, where his guest for the evening is interviewed. On one wall, above an artificial fireplace, is a portrait of Colbert; it originally showed Colbert standing in front of the same mantel with another portrait of himself. On the show's first anniversary, the portrait was replaced by one of Colbert standing in front of the mantel with the first portrait above it; the original was auctioned off at a charity event<ref name= "Anniversary"/> and currently hangs in the Sticky Fingers restaurant in Colbert's native Charleston.<ref name="StickyFingers"></ref> Colbert stated that the portrait will be changed every year to add another level of depth.

The graphics used throughout the show and the studio itself are saturated with American flags, The Last Supper''. "All the architecture of that room points at halo", Colbert said. "On the set, I'd like the lines of the set to converge on my head. And so if you look at the design, it all does, it all points at my head...there's a sort of sun-god burst quality about the set around me."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/44705| title=

For the week of Democratic Party primary in that state on April 22. This is the first time the program has been taped outside its regular New York City studios.<ref></ref>

===Writers' strike===
Production of new episodes was suspended on Writers Guild of America strike, although a live untaped performance called ''The Colbert Report - On Strike!'' took place on December 3, 2007, with proceeds going towards show staffers.<ref name="On Strike!"></ref> The show returned on January 7, 2008, without the writing staff. Upon the show's return, Colbert modified the pronunciation of the show's name, using hard 't's (); a similar move was made by ''The Daily Show'' which returned to air as ''A Daily Show''. On February 13, in honor of the end of the strike, the original names of both shows were restored.

During the strike, Colbert stopped performing the customary "table of contents" that usually precedes the opening titles, as well as other regular written segments such as The Wørd. As a member of the Writers Guild of America, Colbert was barred from writing any material for the show himself which his writers would ordinarily write.<ref></ref> As a result, Colbert conducted more guest interviews, although several people turned down invitations to cross the picket line to appear on the show, including mock feud between Colbert, O'Brien, and Stewart &mdash; during which they appeared on each other's shows &mdash; which culminated in a three-way brawl on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' on February 4, 2008.<ref></ref>

==Stephen Colbert (character)==
left|thumb|150px|[[Stephen Colbert as the fictional Stephen Colbert.]]

The Stephen Colbert character is a semi-fictional character portrayed by comedian and actor Stephen Colbert. The character is a caricature of news pundits such as Bill O'Reilly, independent who is often mistaken for a Republican, but uniformly despises liberals and generally agrees with the actions and decisions of George W. Bush and the Republican Party. This is evidenced by one of the questions that he asks of many of his guests: "George W. Bush: great President, or the ''greatest'' President?"<ref></ref>

The character's self-aggrandizing style includes frequent promotion of an extensive range of fictional merchandising and products, including perfumes, sci-fi novels, medications, his own "man seed", and other products, all of which are either produced or endorsed by Colbert. He has also convinced his viewers, whom he addresses as "the Colbert Nation", to vote for him in various public naming polls: the mascot of the Saginaw Spirit, an Ontario Hockey League team has been named after him.<ref name="ABC12Spirit"></ref>

Colbert's character has been described as a "caustic right-wing bully".<ref name="NYMag1016"/> On the interview segment of the show, Colbert frequently attempts to "nail" his guest by using various logical fallacies, to prove them wrong.<ref name="nprgross"/> Despite his bluster, Colbert's character suffers from arctophobia, the fear of Apple to give him a free iPhone, and finally received one in July. Once he received it, however, he claimed the phone knew so much about him that he had become virtually dependent on it, and that the iPhone itself was a threat.<ref name= "murph"></ref> Colbert also despises the liberal media, ''The New York Times'' in particular, but applauds conservative media such as Fox News on a regular basis.<ref name="Peyser"></ref>

==Recurring themes==
''The Colbert Report'' presents various recurring themes that help define the show.

===Truthiness===
250px|thumb|right|[[Stephen Colbert announces that "The Wørd" of the night is ''truthiness'', during the premiere episode of ''The Colbert Report''.]]

In "The Wørd" segment of the first episode of the ''Report'', Colbert featured the term ''truthiness'', defined as "the quality by which one purports to know something emotionally or instinctively, without regard to evidence or intellectual examination." Colbert said that, "I don't trust books, they're all fact, no heart. And that's exactly what's pulling our country apart today. Let's face it folks, we are a divided nation…between those who think with their head and those who know with their heart."<ref></ref> In December 2005, ''The New York Times'' selected ''truthiness'' as one of nine words that captured the zeitgeist of the year, and in January 2006, the American Dialect Society announced that ''truthiness'' was selected as its 2005 Word of the Year.<ref></ref>

Colbert has made frequent reference to the spread of the word ''truthiness'' since he introduced it, while carping on media accounts of ''truthiness'' that neglect to identify him as its source.<ref name="Peyser"/> ''Truthiness'' has since been discussed, sometimes repeatedly, in ''Salon'', ''ABC's ''Macmillan English Dictionary.<ref></ref> In December of the same year, Merriam-Webster announced that "truthiness" had been voted by visitors to its website to be the #1 Word of the Year for 2006.<ref></ref> On August 27, 2006, the ''Global Language Monitor'' named ''truthiness'' and ''wikiality'' &mdash; both coined by Colbert on ''The Colbert Report'' &mdash; as the top television buzzwords of 2006.<ref></ref><ref></ref> It was used in The New York Times crossword puzzle in June 2008.

===Relation to ''The O'Reilly Factor''===
250px|thumb|right|[[Stephen Colbert appears as a guest on ''The O'Reilly Factor''. January 18, 2007.]]
The Stephen Colbert character and ''The Colbert Report'' are generally parodies of Bill O'Reilly and ''The O'Reilly Factor''. New episodes of ''The Colbert Report'' are scheduled in the same time slot as rebroadcasts of ''The O'Reilly Factor'', while ''Colbert'' rebroadcasts are scheduled during new ''O'Reilly'' shows.<ref name=showing></ref> When O'Reilly appeared on ''The Daily Show'' before the second episode of ''The Colbert Report'' aired, he commented, "Before we get started, somebody told me walking in here, you got some French guy on after you making fun of me?", and made several references in the following interview to 'the French Guy'.<ref name=dowd></ref><ref name="charlestonian"></ref> In a subsequent ''Newsweek'' interview, O'Reilly said that he "feels it's a compliment" to have Colbert parody him because Colbert "isn't mean-spirited" and does not "use [his] platform to injure people." Later, Colbert replied on-air, "I like you too. In fact, if it wasn't for you, this show wouldn't exist."<ref name="NewsweekTruthinessTeller"/>

''The Colbert Report'' features a commentary segment called "The Wørd", similar to O'Reilly's "Talking Points Memo". Like the "Memo", "The Wørd" features the commentator asserting a political point of view with a text screen graphic next to him. However, while O'Reilly's text serves to emphasize his points, Colbert's text generally serves as an ironic counterpoint to his character's position. Other segments that can be juxtaposed with ''The O'Reilly Factor'' are The Colbert Report's ''Inbox'' (compared to O'Reilly's "Factor Mail"); ''Stephen Colbert's Balls for Kidz'' which, unlike The Factor's "Children at Risk", tends to portray messages and lessons typically considered unsuitable for children; and ''That's The Craziest F#?king Thing I've Ever Heard'', which is comparable to O'Reilly's "The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day". Additionally, Colbert parodies O'Reilly's references to his program as the "no spin zone" by inviting viewers of his show to "take a spin in the no fact zone."<ref></ref> O'Reilly and Colbert each appeared as a guest on the other's show on January 18, 2007. O'Reilly seemed to regret  this "crossover" before his time on ''The Colbert Report'' was through, stating as the audience reacted badly to him that it was "a huge mistake, me coming on here."<ref name= "Fox News"/> (As a souvenir, Colbert "stole" a microwave from the O'Reilly green room—in fact, he informed O'Reilly of his intention to take the microwave beforehand—later displaying it on his own show. He later sent over a replacement microwave, emblazoned with ''The Colbert Report'' logo.)

===Greenscreen challenges===
On the green screen, a parody of the Star Wars Kid internet phenomenon.<ref></ref> This was done as part of the "Better Know A District" segment, when Colbert visited California's 6th congressional district, the home of Star Wars creator George Lucas. The greenscreen footage was subsequently edited by fans and their results were posted on the Internet, primarily the website YouTube.<ref></ref> Colbert featured some of these clips on the August 21 episode and issued the "Greenscreen Challenge" to the public &mdash; a contest to create the best video from footage shown in the August 10 episode. Lucas himself made an appearance on the October 11 episode to showcase his entry.<ref name= "Anniversary"></ref>

When American people had won, at which point Colbert declared himself the winner.<ref name= "USAtoday"></ref> As a prize, Colbert received ''The Crane Wife'', The Decemberists' new album, saying "The Crane Wife by the Decemberists? I love the Decemberists, they rock. In your face, Funk!"

===Wrist violence and fictional addiction===
On Livestrong" wrist band, in a hope to increase wrist awareness.<ref></ref> The wristbands were made available for purchase online and Colbert ordered those wearing the bracelets to give them to anyone they meet who is more famous than they themselves.  Colbert has subsequently attempted to pass on bracelets to well-known media figures including Katie Couric, Brian Williams and Matt Lauer.  All proceeds raised by the sales of the wrist bands are given to the Yellow Ribbon Fund.<ref></ref>  On January 23, 2008, Colbert interviewed the head of the Yellow Ribbon Fund, Marie Wood, and presented her a check for the money raised by WristStrong bracelet sales to date, totaling US$171,525, the profits of over 30,000 bracelet sales.<ref></ref>

Colbert had a number of well-known figures autograph his cast, including US$71,000. However, many bids were canceled because bidders failed to get pre-approved by the seller (which is required in the auction). It was sold for US$17,200.<ref></ref>

While Colbert's wrist was in the cast, the character began taking (and subsequently became addicted to) painkillers to deal with his injury, frequently taking absurd doses and displaying exaggerated withdrawal symptoms of irritability and hallucinations when they were denied. Colbert's addiction is apparently a reference to right-wing AM radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh's addiction to the prescription opioid analgesics oxycodone and hydrocodone.<ref></ref>  Following the removal of the cast the show went on a brief hiatus, and following its return on September 10, Colbert claimed that, with help from a court order and rehab over the break, he had kicked his addiction.<ref></ref>

===Recurring characters===

While the show is largely dominated by Colbert, there are a number of recurring characters who appear periodically.  Colbert will frequently address the show's director, Jimmy - a reference to real-life ''Colbert Report'' director Jim Hoskinson - and will sometimes converse with him.  On the rare occasions Jimmy has appeared on screen, he has been portrayed by staff writer Peter Gwinn.  Building manager Tad, portrayed by Paul Dinello, has appeared on the show multiple times to host special segments.  Other recurring members of Colbert's fictional staff have included Meg the intern (played by Meg DeFrancesco), Bobby the stage manager (played by Eric Drysdale) and Killer (uncredited).  Colbert himself has portrayed his character's Cuban alter ego, Esteban Colberto, and voiced Wilford Brimley in false phone conversations.

==Reception==
''The Colbert Report'' drew an unusual amount of media attention prior to its premiere. It was featured in articles in ''The New Yorker'', NPR's ''All Things Considered'' and ''Fresh Air'', CNN, and ''The Washington Post''. ''The New York Times'' alone ran three articles on the ''Report'' before its debut, and has made repeated references to ''The Colbert Report'' since then.<ref></ref> Maureen Dowd, for instance, referred to Colbert's "Dead To Me" board as a metaphor in her column, saying that Oprah Winfrey "should take a page from Stephen Colbert and put the slippery James Frey on her 'Dead to me' list".<ref></ref>

''The Colbert Report'' drew 1.13 million viewers for its premiere episode, 47 percent greater than the average for that time slot over the previous four weeks, and 98 percent of the viewership of ''The Daily Show'', which has Comedy Central's second-largest viewership.<ref></ref> Averaged over its opening week, ''The Report'' had 1.2 million viewers per episode, more than double the average for the same time the previous year, when the time slot was occupied by ''Too Late with Adam Carolla''. The premiere week of ''The Colbert Report'' also coincided with the second-highest-rated week of ''The Daily Show'', behind the week leading up to the 2004 U.S. presidential election.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1%2C1002%2C271%7C98227%7C1%7C%2C00.html| title=

''The Colbert Report'' rapidly became an internet phenomenon, with a vast number of clips from the show being posted onto green screen challenge". On October 27, 2006, however, Comedy Central asserted its copyright over ''The Colbert Report'' clips, and YouTube removed all clips over 5 minutes in length. In February 2007, at Viacom's request, they removed all remaining ''Colbert Report'' clips.

==Presented as non-satirical journalism==
====Tom DeLay Legal Defense Trust====
In May 2006, the film about DeLay, and characterizes the ''Colbert Report'' clip with the headline, "Colbert Cracks the Story on Real Motivations Behind the Movie." On June 8, 2006, Colbert responded by conducting an "Exclusive Fake Interview" on his show with DeLay. Three different interviews with DeLay on different networks were spliced for humorous effect, and Colbert ended the "interview" by saying "I do hope you enjoyed my manipulation of your words." DeLay has since appeared as a guest on the program.

====Robert Wexler====
On The Today Show'' and ABC's ''Good Morning America'' &mdash; which took comments made by Florida Congressman Robert Wexler on ''The Colbert Report'' out of context (e.g.: "I enjoy cocaine and the company of prostitutes because they are a fun thing to do."). Wexler, who ran unopposed in the then-upcoming election, made the comments in response to urging by Colbert that he "say some things that would really lose the election for [Wexler] if [Wexler] were contested."<ref></ref>

==Awards==
In 2006, ''The Colbert Report'' was nominated for four Emmys, one more than its parent, ''The Daily Show''.<ref></ref> However, ''The Colbert Report'' lost two of its Emmy opportunities to ''The Daily Show'' — Colbert received one as a then-member of ''The Daily Show'''s writing staff. Colbert also lost Outstanding Individual Performance In A Variety Or Music Program to Barry Manilow, who was nominated for a one-time PBS special, as Colbert jokingly noted while presenting an Emmy later that night. Manilow later appeared on the show to sign a peace treaty with Colbert, in which they agreed to joint custody of the award. The two then sang a duet of Manilow's classic "I Write the Songs".

The show was nominated for:
*Outstanding Directing For A Variety, Music Or Comedy Program, Episode #110
*Outstanding Individual Performance In A Variety Or Music Program, Stephen Colbert
*Outstanding Variety, Music Or Comedy Series
*Outstanding Writing For A Variety, Music Or Comedy Program

'''''The Colbert Report''''' (dont les ''t'' finaux sont muets, à la française) est une américaine diffusée quatre jours par semaine sur le réseau Daily Show'', émission satirique qui existe depuis 1996. Le ''Report'' propose les opinions du personnage égoïste interpreté par Colbert au ''Daily Show'', mais dans un nouveau milieu — une droite américaine, comme celles de Bill O'Reilly et de Joe Scarborough.

L'émission est diffusée pour la première fois le 17 octobre 2005. Dû à son succès immédiat, Comedy Central et Colbert annoncent le 2 novembre une deuxième série, qui durera jusqu'à la fin de 2006.

==Le point de vue « colbertiste »==
=== Généralités ===
Le centre du ''Colbert Report'' est un personnage fictif portant le nom du comédien Stephen Colbert. Dans ce rôle, contrairement à ses vraies tendances politiques, il est anti-intellectuel, partisan résolu de George W. Bush, et patriotique jusqu'au fanatisme ; il présente ses opinions dans un style grave et sérieux, mais passionné et souvent énergique.

Dans la première émission du ''Colbert Report'', Stephen déclare que la nation se divise en deux groupes : « ''Ceux qui réfléchissent avec leur tête, et ceux qui savent avec leur tripes.'' » Il se désigne comme l'un de ces derniers, et loue George W. Bush pour sa tendance à prendre des décisions sans y réfléchir.

===Le plateau===
Le studio dans lequel est tourné The Colbert Report est l'ancien studio du The Daily Show de Jon Stewart. Le studio du Colbert Report est surnomé 'le nid de l'aigle' et il est censé representer l'attitude égocentrique de Colbert.

Le plateau se compose de deux parties: le bureau, duquel Colbert présente la majorité de son programme, et l'espace consacré aux invités.

=== Sur certains sujets ===
==== Wikipedia ====
Les envolées verbales de Stephen Colbert l'amènent à l'occasion à traiter satiriquement du site web 2006, Colbert consulte d'abord cette encyclopédie en ligne pour savoir s'il était dit que l'État de l'État de Washington ». Après quelques secondes, il décide de qualifier l'Oregon de « Portugal de l'Idaho » et fait semblant de changer l'article de la Wikipédia anglophone pour créer cette nouvelle « réalité », qu'il surnomme « Wikiality »<ref>Le nom sera réutilisé pour une parodie de Conservapedia</ref>. Il ironise ensuite sur le fonctionnement de l'encyclopédie en disant notamment que :
* « quiconque écrit un plus long sujet sur le mot ''truthiness''<ref>''Truthiness'' (« vraimentalité ») est un luthérianisme place ses priorités au bon endroit »
* « ''avec Wikipedia, tout le monde peut se loguer et modifier les textes; et si assez de gens sont d'accord, tout ce que vous écrivez devient réalité.'' »
Il termine son monologue en incitant les téléspectateurs à aller modifier la page sur les éléphants.

Le monologue de Colbert a créé une vague de modifications dès la diffusion de l'extrait, le 1 août à 05:37 (CEST). Plusieurs pages de la Wikipédia anglophones ont été modifiées et ont nécessité une semi-protection temporaire.

Le 30 janvier 2007, Colbert renouvelle son appel aux téléspectateurs de modifier Wikipédia. Cette fois, après avoir fait allusion au projet de Windows Vista, Colbert incite son public de remplacer le texte de l'article "réalité" par la phrase « La réalité devient une marchandise » ''(Reality has become a commodity)''. Les administrateurs y imposent immédiatement une semi-protection.
