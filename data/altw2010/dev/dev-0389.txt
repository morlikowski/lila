The game adds two new character classes; the ''Onion Knight'', taken from ''Final Fantasy III'', and the ''Dark Knight'', which was previously only available to one character, Gafgarion.<ref name="Famitsū Scan"></ref> In addition, ''The War of the Lions'' contains new characters, including Balthier from ''Final Fantasy XII''.<ref></ref> Balthier is said to have an "important role", branded as a heretic in search of the "Cache of Glabados". He joins Ramza, the protagonist while he searches for his sister.<ref name="GameBase">{{cite web | author=GameBase staff | title=

Another addition to the game is a wireless multiplayer mode, both for co-operative and competitive play. In competitive play, opposing teams may place traps onto the battlefield, and these traps are hidden from the opponent. To ease identification, teams are assigned colors. The battle ends after a set number of rounds, and the team with the most remaining HP is declared the winner. The winner may then receive an item randomly generated from treasure chests.<ref name="multi"></ref> 

Other additions include new items and equipment and an increased character party limit, as well as new scenes that flesh out the backstory of existing characters and explaining more events beyond what the player sees through Ramza's eyes.

==Plot==
<!-- best to avoid redundancy, editors are advised only to add the additions and changes to the plot within the PSP version. The entire PlayStation version's plot can be found in the respective article. -->
===Setting===

''The War of the Lions'' retains the setting of the PlayStation version, in which the fictional kingdom of Ivalice had just ended its war with neighboring kingdom Ordalia, dubbed the "Fifty Years' War". In the PSP version, several name changes were made in the retranslation to certain game locations, and certain characters have also been changed. The game revolves around the War of the Lions, a conflict occurring due to the death of King Ondorria. The heir to the throne, Prince Orinus, is only an infant; therefore a regent must be selected to rule in the prince's place. Loyalists of the crown chose Duke Larg as their candidate, while nobles prefer their candidate Duke Goltanna. Both served as generals in the Fifty Years' War under the banner of the White Lion and Black Lion respectively.

===Characters===
''The War of the Lions'' possesses the same large cast in addition to a very deep and complex story. The two leads are taken by Ramza Beoulve of the noble house Beoulve, and Delita Hyral, a peasant who Ramza befriended. Though they have been friends since childhood, Delita's sister's death creates a rift between the two and causes them to choose different paths on how to save Ivalice from chaos. Many names undergo alterations to meet with the better quality of the translation such as Teta becoming Tietra, Olan becoming Orran, and Orlandu changing to Orlandeau.

Two new unlockable characters include Balthier from Final Fantasy Tactics A2.

===Story===

The original storyline of ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' is retained.

The game is told through the flashes back to Ramza's day, finding him a mercenary employed as a bodyguard to Princess Ovelia.  Though Ramza and his companions defend the monastery, a rogue kidnapper sneaks in the back and makes off with the princess: none other than Delita Heiral, future king and Ramza's best friend.

The game's first chapter depicts the past friendship between Ramza, heir to the noble House Beoulve, and Delita, a commoner. Both fight for justice and the common man, but both are astonished when, during a hostage situation, Ramza's elder brother Zalbaag is willing to kill that hostage (Delita's sister Tietra) to expedite a solution. Ramza, having raised hand against his family, is disinherited, while Delita decides to change the world for the better, creating an Ivalice where the nobility cannot take advantage of the weak and common.
