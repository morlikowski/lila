'''HMS Glorious''' - brytyjski duży lekki krążownik  typu ''Corageous'' z okresu I wojny światowej. Po wojnie wraz z bliźniaczym HMS "Courageous"  przebudowany na lotniskowiec.

== Historia ==
HMS "Glorious", HMS "Courageous" i podobny HMS "Furious" zostały zaprojektowane jako lekko opancerzone silnie uzbrojone szybkie jednostki przeznaczone do wsparcia brytyjskiego desantu na niemieckie wybrzeża Bałtyku. 
Stępkę pod jednostkę położono 1 maja Belfaście. Wodowanie jednostki miało miejsce 20 kwietnia 1916 a wejście do służby nastąpiło  w styczniu 1917. Okręt został jednostka flagową 3 Dywizjonu Lekkich Krążowników Grand Fleet.

W traktatu waszyngtońskiego podjęto decyzję o przebudowie okrętu na lotniskowiec. Przebudowa rozpoczęła sie w 1924 a zakończyła 10 marca 1930 kiedy to jednostka ponownie weszła do służby.
Podczas ewakuacji wojsk brytyjskich z Norwegii w czerwcu Scharnhorst" i "Gneisenau" i po trwającej 70 minut bitwie zatonął. Zatonęły też dwie jednostki eskortujące lotniskowiec. Łącznie zginęło 1519 Brytyjczyków.

'''HMS ''Glorious''''' was a warship of the ''HMS Courageous'', and half-sister ''HMS Furious'' were the brainchildren of Admiral Lord Fisher, and were designed to be "light cruiser destroyers". They were originally intended to be heavy support for shallow water operations in the Baltic Sea, which use ultimately never came to pass. She saw action in World War I, and then was converted into an aircraft carrier. Evacuating British troops, she was sunk in 1940, with the loss of over 1,200 lives.

== Genesis ==
thumb|left|300px|3-view drawing as completed in 1917
''Glorious'' was built by Harland and Wolff, Belfast. The design was for a light battlecruiser; while having  guns, she was actually classed by the British Navy as a light cruiser because of her light armour protection. Her keel was laid down on 1 May 1915, the ship was launched 20 April 1916, completed on 14 October 1916, and ''Glorious'' was commissioned in January 1917. She cost £2,119,065 to build.

Her machinery was essentially similar to an earlier light cruiser, ''HMS Champion'', with two sets to drive four shafts. During a test in 1917, ''Glorious'' managed to fire a torpedo out of one of her submerged torpedo tubes while moving at full speed. Under normal conditions, the firing of the underwater tubes could be done at speeds of no more than , because of potential damage caused by water pressure at higher speeds. Her secondary guns were a new type of triple  gun, intended to provide a high rate of fire against torpedo boats and other smaller craft. However, as it turned out, the loaders for the guns would get in each other's way, and the rate of fire was far slower than three single mountings. One interesting note is that it was observed that ''Glorious'' was actually 1½&nbsp;knots faster on full load than when in normal loading condition. Because of her light construction and other faults, causing more than average time in the repair yard, she was nicknamed 'Uproarious'.

When ''Glorious'' commissioned, she was the flagship of the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, and later the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron. On ''Repulse'', she engaged light German forces in the Devonport as a gunnery training ship. Later, she became flagship of the Reserve Fleet.

== Conversion ==

When the hull and high speed, not to mention an unsuccessful original design, made her an ideal candidate for conversion. The vessel was converted to a carrier starting in 1924, and she was re-commissioned 10 March 1930. 
thumb|left|HMS ''Glorious'' after her conversion in 1934The conversion started at Devonport for completion. Her conversion cost £2,137,374. When recommissioned as an aircraft carrier, she had two flight decks:  the main catapults capable of shooting off aircraft weighing 10,000 lb were installed on the main flight deck. She had two levels of hangars, both  long, both 24 feet (7.3 m) high. She could carry up to forty-eight aircraft; when first recommissioned, she carried Fairey Flycatchers, Blackburn Ripons, and Fairey IIIf reconnaissance planes; later, the Fairey Swordfish and Gloster Gladiator types were carried. ''Glorious'' could be distinguished from her sister ''Courageous'' by a longer round-down on her flight deck at the stern, and by a different type of mast.

On April 1, 1931 she collided with the French liner ''Florida'', sixty miles from Gibraltar, holing the liner severely; she took passengers on board and towed the other vessel to Málaga. Over thirty lives were lost, one of which was a member of the crew of ''Glorious''.

== World War II ==
She served with the ''Graf Spee''. 

===Norwegian Campaign===
When the HMS ''Ark Royal'' arrived in Britain, and sailed the next day for Norwegian waters.  She conducted a series of strikes on German positions in Norway with her Skua and Gladiator aircraft. On Germans. On Allied troops from Norway.

===The Sinking===
On No. 263 Squadron ''HMS Acasta'' and ''HMS Ardent'', were intercepted by the German battlecruisers ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau''. The carrier and her escorts were sunk in two hours, roughly 170&nbsp;nautical miles (315&nbsp;km) west of Harstad, with the loss of 1,519 men; there were only 45 survivors. The single survivor from ''Acasta'' was rescued by the Norwegian steam merchant ''Borgund'' which also saved 38 men from one of ''Glorious''' lifeboats. All 39 men saved by ''Borgund'' were set ashore at Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands on 14 June.<ref>[http://www.warsailors.com/singleships/borgund.html www.warsailors.com on D/S ''Borgund'']</ref>
