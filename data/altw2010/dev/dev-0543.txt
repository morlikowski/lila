'''Taranee Cook''' est une des cinq héroïnes de la série de BD dessin animé du même nom.

==Histoire==

Taranee a des cheveux d'un noir presque bleu-violet très courts avec une mèche est nouée par quelques perles, et ses yeux sont marrons. Elle habite avec son grand frère Peter, sa mère et son père. Sa famille est d'origine africaine.

Nouvelle au collège d'Heatherfield, Taranee se lie d'amitié avec Will Vandom, nouvelle comme elle, et un groupe de quatre filles qui étaient déjà amies auparavant: Hay Lin, Cornélia Hale, Irma Lair et Elyon Portrait. Comme ses amies, Taranee commence à être témoin de phénomènes paranormaux. Elle sauve ainsi plusieurs collégiens de pétards ayant explosé en se découvrant un pouvoir de contrôle des flammes. Le lendemain, la grand-mère d'Hay Lin révèle à Will, Cornelia, Irma, Taranee et Hay Lin qu'elles ont été choisies pour être les nouvelles gardiennes de Kandrakar. Taranee reçoit le pouvoir du feu, ce qui fait d'elle la plus puissante des gardiennes après Will. Être la gardienne du feu lui confère également le don de télépathie.

'''Taranee Cook''' is a animated series of the same name. She is one of the members of a group, called W.I.T.C.H. who make up the Guardians, the people who guard Kandrakar, the center of the universe, from evil. Taranee is pyrokinetic, thermokinetic and telepathic. She is African American. She soon finds a guy who thinks she is really sweet. His name is Nigel. Although she is shy, she has been known to be very smart and willing to help in school and when W.I.T.C.H. goes into action.

Taranee is 13 years old and was raised in the town of Sesamo, but later moved to Heatherfield. Her best friend is Will Vandom, the leader of W.I.T.C.H..

Taranee is a shy and reserved teenager, and she has a boyfriend called Nigel Ashcroft, an ex-member of Uriah's gang, who quit because Taranee wanted him to, and so did he. She can be a bit of a "goody-goody" at times and always does what's right. Taranee is the most intelligent member of the group, and her favorite subject is mathematics. She loves photography, basketball, dancing, and classical music, but hates bugs except for butterflies, grasshoppers and crickets.

Her mother is a judge, Theresa Cook, and her father, Lionel is an ex-lawyer turned psychologist, and Taranee stated that she believes that they are overprotective of her. Taranee has an older brother called Peter Lancelot Cook, who, unlike the siblings of other fellow W.I.T.C.H. members, is really kind and respectful to her and her friends, and has a slight crush on Cornelia, and loves to surf and skateboard.

When people play with Taranee's feelings, or when she gets angry, her powers start up. Even Cedric once stated that her elemental power is the most indomitable of all five elements. Her voice is provided by Miss Kittie.

==Chronology==
=== Before W.I.T.C.H. ===
Before living in Heatherfield, Taranee lived in another town known as Sesamo. Because of the move to a different town, Taranee was emotionally and mentally affected but understood that she had no choice but to move to Heatherfield because of her parents new job placement. In the comics, it is stated that a year before moving to Heatherfield, the Cook family went house hunting on their own accord. Taranee, upset by this, wondered off by herself and found a house of her own. Looking through the window, she saw a hypnotic fire dancing inside. When Taranee asked the real-estate agent about the house, he told her that it was abandoned and that nobody had lived there for years. When Taranee and her parents enter the house, the fire Taranee saw disappeared and the house appeared to be empty. The Cook family made the decision to move into this particular house. In the comics, Taranee moved to Heatherfield just a few days before Will, but in the animated series she moved one year prior to Will.

=== Forming W.I.T.C.H. ===
''Comics:'' In the comics, Taranee bumped into the new girl Will Vandom, just a few days after moving to Heatherfield herself. The two girls became fast friends, and soon became friends with Cornelia Hale, Irma Lair, Hay Lin and Elyon Brown as well. One night, their local  school was throwing a Halloween dance where Cornelia, Irma, Hay Lin and Elyon urge Taranee and Will to come with them. Uriah, the school bully, and his gang play a prank involving firecrackers that puts the girls in harms way, but after a bit of Taranee's quick thinking and unidentified powers, the girls get off without a scratch. The next day Will, Irma, Taranee, Cornelia and Hay Lin meet at Hay Lin's house to discuss the strange dreams that they had. It was them that Yan Lin , Hay Lin's grandmother, informed the girls about their powers and about Kandrakar, entrusting the Heart of Kandrakar to Will.

''Animated Series:'' In the animated series, Taranee had been friends with Irma, Cornelia and Hay Lin since living in Heatherfield. After Uriah's gang picks on the new girl Will at the science fair, Taranee encourages the girls to be nice to her and calls Will over to talk to them. Taranee tells Will that she knows what it's like to be the new girl. While the other girls talk about how they hate Uriah, they some how exude a bit of their powers. Hay Lin arrives and invites the girls for tea and cookies at her house, as that's what her grandmother had influenced Hay Lin to do. At Hay Lin's, Yan Lin explains about the Guardians and entrusts the Heart of Kandrakar to Will. This is when Taranee and the girls learn about their powers.

=== Quitting W.I.T.C.H. ===
In the third saga of the comic books, Taranee is provoked by the Oracle's recent actions, which include not telling Cornelia about Caleb's decision to go back to Meridian and not helping them in their next task. Taranee's last straw is when the nymph Xin Jing's gift of regenaration cures her eyesight, as she did not ask for it in the first place and did not want it and had to wear glasses when she did not need them.

Taranee then decides to quit being a Guardian, although she doesn't lose her place as Guardian of Fire. The Oracle is sure she will come back (she does come back), but sends for a replacement anyway. The replacement is the warrior Orube, from the Oracle's home planet of Basilíade, who is given no elemental power but is great at martial arts and can shoot energy beams.

Orube goes to live on Earth under the alias of Mrs. Rudolph's niece Rebbeca Rudolph in order to better understand the other girls and get along with them. Orube is welcome to stay as a Guardian after Taranee's return, but is mostly left out of missions and audiences at Kandrakar in the fourth saga.
