'''Komarci''' (Culicidae) su porodica red dvokrilaca.

Porodica ima oko 40 rodova i obuhvaća oko 31.000 vrsta. Razvili su se prije oko 170 milijuna godina.

==Rasprostranjenost==
Komarci nastanjuju sva područja na svijetu, osim polarnih područja, pustinja i područja viših od 1500 metara N/m, ali najčešće u blizini vode, neovisno o njenoj veličini i kvaliteti. No, različite vrste žive u vrlo različitim područjima.

Veliki su od 0,3 do 2 cm. Zbog svoje male građe u mogućnosti su naseliti vrlo nepristupačna staništa. Imaju usko malariju, groznicu i druge proteine. Inače se oba spola hrane nektarom i sokovima voća, koji ne sadrže protein. 

== Građa tijela ==

*Glava - usni organi, osjetila, složene oči i ticala
*Prsa - noge i krila - organi za kretanje
*Zadak - organi za probavu, izlučivanje i razmnožavanje

== Spolni život == 
Čim se izlegu, odrasli mužjaci nakon kratkog vremena formiraju svoj novi roj. Roj je kod komaraca skupina mužjaka koji se vrtložno kreću gore dolje. U takav novoformirani roj komaraca ulijeće ženka i oplođuje se sa odabranim partnerom. Kod pojedinih vrsti komaraca oplodnja se odvija u zraku, ali ipak većina vrsti za oplodnju izabere neko mirno skrovito mjesto.
== Let ==
Proučavajući let komaraca znanstvenici su utvrdili da postoje tri različita leta komaraca: migratorni, apetitivni i konzumatorni let.
== Rojenje ==
Rojenje je vrlo specifično ponašanje kukaca i njihov je način opstanka i širenja vrste. Za rojenje svakoj zajednici kukaca potrebno je uskladiti neke od uvijeta, a kod komaraca su: stanje aktivnosti komarca, prostorni odnosi, svjetlost, vjetar, zvuk, zajednica različitih vrsta komaraca te temperatura i vlažnost. Stanje aktivnosti je najznačajniji uvjet komaraca da formiraju roj.

== Nova vrsta u Hrvatskoj ==
''arbovirusa i parazita, javnozdravstvenih i znanstvenih ustanova.

== Zimovanje ==
Kukci nepogriješivo predosjećaju dolazak zimskih dana prije svega kraćim trajanjem dnevne vrsti. Većina generacije prije zime mora pomno odabrati  mjesto polaganja zimskih jaja koja moraju osim vremenskih neprilika biti sačuvana i od eventualnih neprijatelja.

'''Mosquitoes''' family '''Culicidae'''. They have a pair of scaled wings, a pair of disease vectors known, killing millions of people over thousands of years and continuing to kill millions per year by the spread of diseases.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Length varies but is rarely greater than 16 mm (0.6 mg (0.04 grain). A mosquito can fly for 1 to 4 hours continuously at up to 1–2 km/h<ref>http://www.sove.org/Journal%20PDF/journal%202004%20pdfs/Kaufmann.pdf</ref> travelling up to 10 km in a night. Most species are nocturnal or crepuscular (dawn or dusk) feeders. During the heat of the day most mosquitoes rest in a cool place and wait for the evenings. They may still bite if disturbed.<ref>[http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~insects/restbox.htm Rest boxes as mosquito surveillance tools<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
__TOC__

==Feeding habits==

Both male and female mosquitoes are nectar feeders, but the female of many species is also capable of haematophagy (drinking blood). Females do not require blood for survival, but they do need supplemental substances (like protein and iron) to develop eggs. Prior to and during blood feeding, they inject saliva. The ''Toxorhynchites'' species of mosquito never drink blood.<ref>[http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~insects/sp2.htm The carnivores, Toxorhynchites<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This genus includes the largest of the extant mosquitoes, the larvae of which are predatory on the larvae of other mosquitoes.  These mosquito eaters have been used in the past as mosquito control agents with varying success.<ref>http://www.pestscience.com/PDF/BNIra56.PDF</ref>

Female mosquitoes hunt their blood host by detecting carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and 1-octen-3-ol from a distance. 

===Mosquito Saliva===

In order for a mosquito to obtain a blood meal it must surmount the vertebrate physiological responses. The mosquito, as with all blood-feeding arthropods, has evolved mechanisms to effectively block the hemostasis system with their saliva which contains a complex mixture of secreted proteins.  Mosquito saliva affects vascular constriction, blood clotting, platelet aggregation, inflammation, immunity, and angiogenesis.<ref name="autogenerated4"></ref>  Universally, hematophagous arthropod saliva contains at least one anticlotting, one anti-platelet, and one vasodilatory substance.  Mosquito saliva also contains enzymes that aid in sugar feeding<ref></ref> and antimicrobial agents to control bacterial growth in the sugar meal.<ref></ref>  The composition of mosquito saliva is relatively simple as it usually contains fewer than 20 dominant proteins.<ref name="autogenerated1"></ref>  Despite the great strides in knowledge of these molecules and their role in bloodfeeding achieved recently, scientists still cannot ascribe functions to more than half of the molecules found in arthropod saliva.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

It is now well recognized that the feeding ticks, sandflies, and, more recently, mosquitoes have an ability to modulate the immune response of the animals (hosts) they feed on.<ref name="autogenerated4" />  The presence of this activity in vector saliva is a reflection of the inherent overlapping and interconnected nature of the host hemostatic and inflammatory/immunological responses and the intrinsic need to prevent these host defenses from disrupting successful feeding. The mechanism for mosquito saliva-induced alteration of the host immune response is unclear, but the data has become increasingly convincing that such an effect occurs. Early work described a factor in saliva that directly suppresses TNF-α release, but not antigen-induced histamine secretion, from activated mast cells.<ref></ref>  Experiments by Cross et al. (1994) demonstrated that the inclusion of ''Ae. aegypti'' mosquito saliva into naïve cultures led to a suppression of interleukin (IL)-2 and IFN-γ production, while the cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 are unaffected by mosquito saliva.<ref name="autogenerated2"></ref>  Cellular proliferation in response to IL-2 is clearly reduced by prior treatment of cells with SGE.<ref name="autogenerated2" />  Correspondingly, activated splenocytes isolated from mice fed upon by either'' Ae. aegypti'' or ''Cx. pipiens'' mosquitoes produce markedly higher levels of IL-4 and IL-10 concurrent with suppressed IFN-γ production.<ref name="autogenerated3"></ref>  Unexpectedly, this shift in cytokine expression is observed in splenocytes up to 10 days after mosquito exposure, suggesting that natural feeding of mosquitoes can have a profound, enduring, and systemic effect on the immune response.<ref name="autogenerated3" />

T cell populations are decidedly susceptible to the suppressive effect of mosquito saliva, showing enhanced mortality and decreased division rates.<ref></ref>  Parallel work by Wasserman et al. (2004) demonstrated that T- and B-cell proliferation was inhibited in a dose dependent manner with concentrations as low as 1/7th of the saliva in a single mosquito.<ref></ref>  Depinay et al. (2005) observed a suppression of antibody-specific T cell responses mediated by mosquito saliva and dependent on mast cells and IL-10 expression.<ref></ref>  
A recent study suggests that mosquito saliva can also decrease expression of interferon−α/β during early mosquito-borne virus infection.<ref></ref>  The contribution of type I interferons (IFN) in recovery from infection with viruses has been demonstrated ''in vivo'' by the therapeutic and prophylactic effects of administration of IFN-inducers or IFN,<ref></ref> and recent research suggests that mosquito saliva exacerbates West Nile virus infection,<ref></ref> as well as other mosquito-transmitted viruses.<ref></ref>

===Mosquitoes and health===
right|thumb|Endemic range of [[yellow fever in Africa (2005)]]right|thumb|Endemic range of [[yellow fever in South America (2005)]]
Mosquitoes are a vector agent that carries disease-causing viruses and parasites from person to person without catching the disease themselves. Female mosquitoes suck blood from people and other animals as part of their eating and breeding habits. When a mosquito bites, she also injects saliva and anti-coagulants into the blood which may also contain disease-causing viruses or other parasites. This cycle can be interrupted by killing the mosquitoes, isolating infected people from all mosquitoes while they are infectious or vaccinating the exposed population. All three techniques have been used, often in combination, to control mosquito transmitted diseases. Window screens, introduced in the 1880s, were called "the most humane contribution the 19th century made to the preservation of sanity and good temper."<ref>[http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~insects/hisreas.htm History/reason of mosquito control in nj<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Mosquitoes are estimated to transmit disease to more than 700 million people annually in Africa, South America, Central America, Mexico and much of Asia with millions of resulting deaths. In Europe, Russia, Greenland, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and other temperate and developed countries, mosquito bites are now mostly an irritating nuisance; but still cause some deaths each year.<ref>[http://www.slu.edu/colleges/sph/csbei/emerginginfections/wnv/key_ref/acp_asim_1.pdf Mosquitoes and Mosquito Repellents: A Clinician's Guide] by Mark S. Fradin: '''Annals of Internal Medicine''', 1 June 1998. 128:931-940. Retrieved 10 July 2006.</ref> 
Historically, before mosquito transmitted diseases were brought under control, they caused tens of thousands of deaths in these countries and hundreds of thousands of infections.<ref> ''The American Plague'', by Molly Caldwell Crosby, pg 12, Berkley Books, New York, 2005, ISBN 0-425-21202-5</ref> Mosquitoes were shown to be the method by which yellow fever and malaria were transmitted from person to person by Walter Reed, William C. Gorgas and associates in the U.S. Army Medical Corps first in Cuba and then around the Panama Canal in the early 1900s.<ref> '''The Path Between the Seas: the Creation of the Panama Canal 1870-1914''', by David McCullough,1977, Simon and Shuster, ISBN 0-971-22563-4 </REF><ref> ''The American Plague'', by Molly Caldwell Crosby, pg 100-202, Berkley Books, New York, 2005, ISBN 0-425-21202-5</ref> Since then other diseases have been shown to be transmitted the same way.

The mosquito genus ''Anopheles'' carries the malaria parasite (see ''Plasmodium''). Worldwide, malaria is a leading cause of premature mortality, particularly in children under the age of five, with around 5.3 million deaths annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Some species of mosquito can carry the filariasis worm, a parasite that causes a disfiguring condition (often referred to as elephantiasis) characterized by a great swelling of several parts of the body; worldwide, around 40 million people are living with a filariasis disability. The viral diseases yellow fever and dengue fever are transmitted mostly by  ''Aedes aegypti'' mosquitoes.
Other viral diseases like  epidemic polyarthritis, Rift Valley fever, Ross River Fever, St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis, La Crosse encephalitis and several other encephalitis type diseases are carried by several different mosquitoes. Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and Western equine encephalitis (WEE) occurs in the United States where it causes disease in humans, horses, and some bird species. Because of the high mortality rate, EEE and WEE are regarded as two of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States. Symptoms range from mild flu-like illness to encephalitis, coma and death.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/list_mosquitoborne.htm Mosquito-borne diseases, infectious disease information, NCID, CDC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Viruses carried by arthropods such as mosquitoes or ticks are known collectively as arboviruses. West Nile virus was accidentally introduced into the United States in 1999  and by 2003  had spread to almost every state with over 3,000 cases in 2006.

A mosquito's period of feeding is often undetected; the bite only becomes apparent because of the immune reaction it provokes. When a mosquito bites a human, she injects saliva and hive appears in minutes where the immune response has broken capillary blood vessels and fluid has collected under the skin. This type of reaction is common in older children and adults. Some adults can become desensitized to mosquitoes and have little or no reaction to their bites, while others can become hyper-sensitive with bites causing blistering, bruising, and large inflammatory reactions, a response known as Skeeter Syndrome.

===Mosquito control and integrated mosquito management===

There are two kinds of mosquito control: large, organized programs to reduce mosquito populations over a wide area, and actions individuals can take to control or exclude mosquitoes with respect to themselves and their own property.

Organized mosquito control programs today draw on the principles of integrated pest management.  An integrated mosquito control program typically includes the following measures, all guided by surveillance of mosquito populations and knowledge of the mosquito life cycle:<ref>[http://vector.ifas.ufl.edu/chap03.pdf C:\MyFiles\Dame\Chap-3\Chap03-pdf.wpd<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* source reduction - the removal of mosquito breeding habitats
* habitat modification - manipulating habitats to reduce breeding or access
* biocontrol - introducing natural predators of mosquitoes
* larvicide - using pesticides to reduce larval populations
* adulticide - using pesticides to reduce adult populations

Some solutions for malaria control efforts in the klamboe), mosquito nets treated with insecticide (often permethrin), and DDT.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/control_prevention/vector_control.htm Vector Control | CDC Malaria<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Nets are treated with insecticide because mosquitoes can sometimes get past an imperfect net.  Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets in preventing mosquito bites.<ref>[http://www.wgbh.org:81/cgi-bin/nph-algs.cgi/000000A/http/www.wgbh.org/schedules/program-info?program_id=2682027&episode_id=2682029 Hull, Kevin. (2006) "Malaria: Fever Wars". PBS Documentary]</ref>
Untreated mosquito nets are less expensive, and they are effective in protecting humans when the nets do not have any holes and are tightly sealed around the edges.  Insecticide free nets do not adversely affect the health of natural predators such as dragonflies. 

The role of DDT in combating mosquitoes has been the subject of considerable controversy. While some argue that DDT deeply damages biodiversity, others argue that DDT is the most effective weapon in combating mosquitoes and hence malaria. While some of this disagreement is based on differences in the extent to which disease control is valued as opposed to the value of biodiversity, there is also genuine disagreement amongst experts about the costs and benefits of using DDT. Moreover, DDT-resistant mosquitoes have started to increase in numbers, especially in tropics due to mutations, reducing the effectiveness of this chemical.

===Mosquito repellents and personal mosquito control===
right|thumb|A mosquito net

One of the main, non-chemical ways to prevent mosquito bites is the mosquito net. Mosquito netting if properly used and maintained (no holes), provides the maximum possible personal protection against biting insects. In many areas of the world, mosquitoes are not only a nuisance, but also pose a serious health threat. Sleeping under a bednet is highly recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO)<ref>http://www.who.int/malaria/docs/healthworkers/healthworkers.pdf |pg. 19 </ref> and the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC)<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/trypanosomiasis/factsht_wa_trypanosomiasis.htm Division of Parasitic Diseases - West African trypanosomiasis Fact Sheet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> if staying in these areas.

One of the most popular chemical skin treatments is ''N'',''N''-diethyl-''meta''-toluamide, commonly known as DEET. It has been used widely since its invention by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1945. DEET products have been widely used for many years but these products have occasionally been associated with some minor to moderate adverse reactions. DEET concentrations in repellents range from 5% up to 100%. 

Other less commonly used mosquito repellents include: catnip oil extract, nepetalactone (no known credible tests), citronella 10% solution (84% effective for about 1 hour),  or eucalyptus oil extract.<ref>Fradin M S, Day J F. "Comparative efficacy of insect repellents against mosquito bites." ''New England Journal of Medicine'' 2002; 347: 13-18.</ref> A soybean oil-based product worked for about 1.5 hours and a lemon eucalyptus-based solution worked for about 3 hours.

Bug Repellents </ref>  So far [[DEET is the champion effective repellent against mosquitoes, especially when worn in conjunction with light coloured clothing, long sleeved pants and shirts and a hat.

Mosquitoes use carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and 1-octen-3-ol from human and animal breath and sweat as odor cues and DEET inhibits the detection of the latter in insects.<ref>

Other commercial products offered for household mosquito "control" include small electrical mats, mosquito repellent vapor, DEET-impregnated wrist bands, and mosquito coils containing a form of the chemical lemon thyme and the mosquito plant (Pelargonium) will act against mosquitoes.

Bug zappers kill a wide range of flying insects including many beneficial insects that eat mosquitoes as well as some mosquitoes. Bug zappers have not been proven effective at controlling overall mosquito population.
