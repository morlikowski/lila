==Biography==
===Early life===
Archer, the son of famed warp engineer Henry Archer and his wife Sally, was born in 2112 in San Francisco. His dreams of exploring started as a boy. As a youth, Archer earned the Eagle Scout Award, along with 26 Merit Badges, from the Boy Scouts of America.

Archer grew up with a distrust of Vulcans, since he perceived them as having held back Humanity's progress, particularly with regard to his father's warp five engine. It is strongly suggested in several episodes ("The Seventh", among others) that prior to joining Starfleet, he studied at and played water polo for Stanford University just south of San Francisco. (Starfleet Academy would not be founded until 2161.)

In Starfleet, Archer served as a pilot in the NX warp trials with A.G. Robinson, Duvall, and Gardner (all mentioned in the episode "First Flight"; it is assumed it is this Gardner who becomes Admiral when Admiral The Forge"). Robinson pushed the limits of a test ship, the NX-Alpha, resulting in its destruction. The Vulcans recommended the warp trials end, which Starfleet agreed to until Captain of ''Enterprise'', Earth's first warp five starship.

===Seasons 1 and 2: The explorer===
As a man who loves to travel amongst the stars, Archer realizes being captain is a larger duty than manager and astronomer. He runs into species from all over the quadrant trying to kill him and his crew. Encounters with the Mazarites, Tholians, Suliban, and Klingons cause Archer to become more of a military commander.

In addition, Archer learns the duties of captain include being a Porthos, contracts a deadly illness on an alien world.

While exploring, Archer becomes an enemy of the Klingons. In a dispute with the bounty is put on Archer's head and tensions with the Klingon Empire increase.

Also during this period, Archer has the distinction of making Earth's official first contact with dozens of alien races, including the Xindi, and Romulans (although this is not a face-to-face contact).

===Temporal Cold War===
Although initially optimistic, Archer becomes involved in his first mission as captain of ''Enterprise'' in the middle of the Broken Bow." In that episode, the audience is introduced to the Suliban and a mysterious being from the future (informally referred to as "Future Guy") who is guiding them.

As the Temporal Cold War continues, we also meet Daniels, a character whose purpose seemingly is to safeguard Archer in particular and ''Enterprise'' in general. Daniels' comments are that Archer will be the man who helps to form the United Federation of Planets, and it becomes apparent by the third season that Daniels is representing the Federation throughout the Temporal Cold War.

===Season 3: Military commander in the Expanse===
<!--IMAGE REMOVED AS NFCC#8 VIOLATIONthumb|left|175px|Archer in the Expanse.-->
Following the Xindi attack on Earth, including torturing a prisoner, cloning Tucker to harvest body parts in order to save the chief engineer and thus killing the clone, and stealing a vital warp coil and leaving a ship of aliens stranded in space.

While on his mission to locate the Xindi, Archer is briefly transformed into a member of the extinct Loque'eque by a mutagenic alternate timeline in which the ''Enterprise'''s mission fails and Earth is destroyed. With the help of Daniels, Archer, along with travels back in time to 2004 Detroit to prevent the release of a Xindi-Reptilian bio-weapon.

By the end of the season, Archer is presumed dead when the Xindi superweapon is destroyed. However, in reality, he is transported back to the early 1940s during World War II, as is ''Enterprise''.

===Season 4: The diplomat===
After returning home in 2154, Archer helps a faction of Vulcans fight an oppressive government on their planet. During this incident, he is the recipient of the ''katra'', or living spirit, of the great Vulcan philosopher Kirk's time. In the process, Archer becomes the first known Human participant in a Vulcan Affliction").

Archer is also involved in one of the first, and possibly most significant, treaties yet, being asked to escort Gral, the Talas, and Shran avenges her death by asking the Tellarite who killed her to fight to the death. In an attempt to protect the fragile peace treaty, Archer takes the challenge instead and Shran is incapacitated (but not seriously hurt). The alliance remains intact, and soon after, evolves into the Demons", "Terra Prime", "These Are the Voyages...")

===Relationship with T'Pol===
Although initially distrustful of his Vulcan science officer Enterprise'' for its mission to locate and destroy the Xindi superweapon.

Episodes in the first and second seasons seemed to suggest that Archer and T'Pol had the potential to become more than just close friends. Archer is openly jealous when a Vulcan suitor pursues T'Pol in the episode "Fusion", and insists the Vulcans won't take something away from him that's important ("Shadows of P'Jem") &mdash; meaning T'Pol. He assists her in finding help with her Pa'nar Syndrome, and indicates he is happy she will be staying aboard in the episode "Stigma", and many other instances. However, it appears Archer's drive to complete the Xindi mission and save Earth diminished this possibility.

There has also been evidence of extreme sexual tension between T'Pol and Captain Archer, as seen in the episode "Shadows of P'Jem" where T'Pol and Archer are tied up together and end up in embarrassing and sexually stimulating positions as they try to escape the bonds. This was all accompanied by intense staring, slight moaning and heavy breathing.

In the alternate timeline of ''Twilight'', T'Pol becomes Archer's caretaker for more than a decade after subspace parasites rob him of his ability to form long-term memories after the point of the incident; the question of how far their relationship had progressed in this timeline goes unanswered, but it is made clear that some bond of love existed by that point, albeit somewhat one-sided as this alternate future Archer is unable to retain memory of it. It remains to be seen whether anything close to this occurs in the "real" timeline, even though the writer of ''Twilight'' indicated in ''Star Trek Communicator'' that eventually Archer and T'Pol would marry in the real timeline, a point some think was in jest. The series finale gives no clue as to whether this outcome actually occurs, but certainly implies a much closer relationship than previously seen and leaves it open for the possibility.

Il capitano '''Jonathan Archer''' è un personaggio della serie televisiva di fantascienza ''Star Trek: Enterprise'' interpretato dall'attore Scott Bakula.
Nell'universo di Star Trek, Archer è il capitano della prima curvatura 5 ''(warp 5)'', l'Enterprise (NX-01).

== Biografia ==

Archer è nato a 2111), ma da molti anni vive a San Francisco in California.
Suo padre, Henry Archer, prese parte al team che sviluppò la tecnologia alla base dell'Enterprise NX-01. Jonathan ha vissuto in prima persona le difficoltà affrontate da suo padre nel collaborare con i Vulcaniani. Jonathan infatti li ha sempre percepiti come un ostacolo allo sviluppo umano, ritenendo che i Vulcaniani volessero rallentare lo sviluppo del motore a curvatura 5. È molto legato al progetto Warp 5 per via di suo padre.

Nel 2152 Archer fu condannato all'ergastolo da un tribunale di Nerendra III a lavori forzati sulla colonia penale di Rura Penthe, assieme al suo ex avvocato klingon Kolos. Archer comunque fu presto soccorso dal suo equipaggio, mentre Kolos (condannato ad un anno) decise di rimanere.
