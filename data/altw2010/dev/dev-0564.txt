The '''Bell Boeing Quad TiltRotor''' (QTR) is a proposed four-rotor derivative of the U.S. Army's Joint Heavy Lift program. It would have a cargo capacity roughly equivalent to the C-130 Hercules, cruise at 250 knots, and land at unimproved sites vertically like a helicopter.<ref name="boeing2">[http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2006/december/i_ids03.pdf "Diversity in Design: Boeing offers 2 of 5 development options in rotorcraft program"], Boeing Frontiers magazine, January 2007.</ref>

==Development==
Bell and Boeing have received a cost-sharing contract worth US$3.45 million from the U.S. Army's Aviation Applied Technology Directorate for an 18-month conceptual design and analysis study lasting through March 2007, in conjunction with the Joint Heavy Lift program.<ref name="boeing3">[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2005/q3/nr_050922p.html "Boeing receives two study contracts from U.S. Army for Joint Heavy Lift"], Boeing press release, Phantom Works. The QTR study is one of five designs; another of the five is also a Boeing program, an advanced version of the CH-47 Chinook.<ref name="boeing2"/>

During the initial baseline design study, Bell's engineers are designing the wing, engine and rotor, while the Boeing team is designing the fuselage and internal systems.<ref name="ai1">Fein, Geoff.

A one-fifth-scale transonic wind tunnel) at NASA's Langley Research Center during summer 2006. The "semi-span" model (representing the right half of the aircraft) measured 213 inches in length, and had powered 91-inch rotors, operational nacelles, "dynamically representative" wings.<ref name="testing">[http://www.helis.com/news/2006/quadwindtunnel.htm "Wind Tunnel testing completed on Bell Boeing quad tiltrotor"], Helis.com, September 13, 2006.</ref>

The primary test objective was to study the aeroelastic effects on the aft wing of the forward wing's rotors and establish a baseline aircraft configuration.<ref name="boeing2"/> Alan Ewing, Bell's QTR program manager, reported that "Testing showed those loads from that vortex on the rear rotor [are the] same as the loads we see on the front [rotors]," and "Aeroelastic stability of the wing looks exactly the same as the conventional tiltrotor". These tests used a model with a three-bladed rotor, future tests will explore the effects of using a four-bladed system.<ref name="ai1"/>

Besides the research performed jointly under the contract, Bell has funded additional research and wind tunnel testing in cooperation with NASA and the Army.<ref name="rotorbreeze1">[http://www.bellhelicopter.com/en/support/pdf/rb/rb_oct06.pdf "Wind Tunnel testing completed on Bell Boeing quad tiltrotor"], ''Rotorbreeze'', p. 14, October 2006.</ref>  After submission of initial concept study reports, testing of full-scale components and possibly a sub-scale vehicle test program was expected to begin.<ref name="boeing2"/> Pending approval, first flight of a full-scale prototype aircraft was slated for 2012.<ref name="ai1"/>  

The study was completed in May 2007,<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/01/14/220796/heavy-duty-us-army-backs-tiltrotor-as-future-battlefield.html "Heavy duty: US Army backs tiltrotor as future battlefield airlifter"], Flight International, 14 January 2008.</ref> with the Quad TiltRotor selected for further development.  However, additional armor on Future Combat Systems (FCS) vehicles caused their weight to increase from 20 tons to 27 tons which requires a larger aircraft.<ref>Osborn, Kris. [http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3482732&c=FEA&s=CVS "USAF, Army Merge Heavy-Lift Efforts"], Defensenews.com, 14 April 2008.</ref>  In mid-2008, the Army continued the Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) studies with new contracts to the Bell-Boeing and Karem Aircraft/Lockheed Martin teams.  The teams are to modify their designs to reach new JHL specifications.<ref>Warwick, Graham [http://www.aviationnow.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/JHL070108.xml&headline=U.S.%20Army%20Extends%20JHL%20Concept%20Studies&channel=defense "U.S. Army Extends JHL Concept Studies"], Aviation Week, 1 July 2008.

==Design==
The conceptual design is for a large tandem wing aircraft with V-22 type engines and 50-foot rotors at each of the four wing tips. The C-130-size fuselage would have a 747-inch-long cargo bay with a rear loading ramp that could carry 110 paratroopers or 150 standard-seating passengers. In cargo configuration, it would accommodate eight 463L pallets.<ref name="ai1"/>

'''Bell Boeing Quad TiltRotor''' - На данный момент проект в стадии разработки. Тандем Bell Helicopter и Boeing получил от армии США контракт на $3,45 миллиона в 2005 году. Фирмы должны выполнить концептуальный проект и поранализировать возможность создания четырёхроторного тяжёлого конвертоплана — Quad TiltRotor (QTR). У аппарата должно быть два крыла, на концах которых расположатся поворачивающиеся на 90% двигатели с воздушными винтами. Синхронизирующие валы, связывающие их, должны позволить удержаться аппарату в воздухе в случае отказа одного-двух двигателей. Задача этой модели - перевозить более тяжёлые грузы чем V-22 Osprey.
