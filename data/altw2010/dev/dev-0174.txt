A letter from the group was also mailed to the media in Los Angeles, California. It reinforced the claim in the name of the Zaven Abedian Commando Group of ASALA. The attack prompted Canadian authorities to improve security measures at the U.S., French, and Swiss embassies. All three countries had Armenians in custody for attacks on Turkish targets. <ref>{{citeweb

  |description=The Los Angeles offices of the Swiss Bank Corporation were bombed. Suspected was Vicken Tcharkhutian, a senior designer for Fluor, a major Southern California engineering firm, and his alleged accomplices, Hratch Kozibioukian and his wife Stranouche of Van Nuys, and Varant Chirinian of Glendale. All are accused of involvement in the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia. Federal investigators identify the group as a Marxist-Leninist organization headquartering in Lebanon and responsible for bombings in Europe, Canada, and the United States. Tcharkhutian fled to France who refused to extradite him to the United States; he then fled to Libya. His accomplices face trial in December. (See 5/30/82 incident also attributed to this group.) Tcharkhutian was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in October, 1987. In November he admitted in federal court to his involvement in a series of bombings in the U.S.<ref>{{citeweb

  |description=Three members of ASALA were arrested and accused of placing an "explosive device" in front of the Air Canada cargo building at Los Angeles International Airport. The bomb was defused by members of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad. The arrests, made later in the day, were the culmination of four months of joint investigation by the FBI, Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office of a series of local bombings dating back to 1980. The three accused are Hratch Kozibioukian, his wife Stanouche Kozibioukian, and Varant Barkev Chirinian. Police believe this latest bombing may have been retaliation for the arrest of Armenians in Canada two weeks ago. A fourth member, Vicken Tcharkhutian, was discovered in France. The U.S. request for his extradition was refused by a French court on grounds that the 1909 Franco-American extradition treaty does not cover bomb fabrication. France did expel the Armenian, however, who left for Cyprus, and thence to Libya. Tcharkhutian was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in October, 1987. In November he admitted in federal court to his involvement in a series of bombings in the U.S.<ref>{{citeweb

  |description=ASALA members attacked the Ankara Esenboga Airport. Nine people were killed and 78 injured in the bomb and machine-gun shootout between the Armenians and Turkish security forces. The dead included an American and a West German passenger. The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) claimed responsibility for the attack and stated that the attack was against the "Turkish fascist occupation of our land," and warned of suicide attacks in the United States, Canada, England, Sweden, and Switzerland unless 85 prisoners held in those countries were not released within seven days. A caller to the press stated that the operation was staged by "Martyr Kharmian Hayrik Suicide Squad." Hayrik was not further identified. An ASALA member was apprehended and put on trial at the Ankara Martial Law Command 3d Military Court on September 8. Levon Ekmekjian, a French national of Lebanese extraction, was wounded during the attack and admitted that he had an accomplice in the killing and that it had been planned for some time. When he was on the stand, he said "I came here motivated by belief, however, after this incident understand how ridiculous and wrong that belief was...." Ekmekjian was sentenced to death, but was expected to appeal the sentence. Claims later made by ASALA maintained that there were two assault teams and that the first unit struck the headquarters of the Turkish military police near the airport and then took over the passenger terminal. ASALA claimed that there were more than 30 fatalities and 102 injuries in the two operations. <ref>{{citeweb
