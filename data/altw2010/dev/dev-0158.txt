'''Mitropa Cup''' var den første større klubbturnering i Østerrikske Fotballforbundet, Hugo Meisl, på et møte i Venezia i 1927. Første kamp gikk av stabelen 14. august samme år.

Første turnering ble spilt som et cupspill, og to lag fra italienske lag de jugoslaviske, og i Ferencvaros skulle møtt rumenske Rapid Bucuresti, men ettersom Ungarn hadde invadert Nordøst-Romania, ble kampen aldri spilt.

Turneringen ble gjenopptatt i 1952, men mistet mye av sin status pga. introduksjonen av andre europeiske klubbturneringer. På slutten var den redusert til en turnering mellom 2.divisjonsvinnerne i de deltakende landene. Den siste finalen ble vunnet av jugoslaviske Borac Banja Luka, foran mindre enn tusen tilskuere.

The '''Mitropa Cup''', officially called the '''La Coupe de l'Europe Centrale''' was one of the first really international major European football cups for club sides.  After World War II in 1951 a replacement tournament named ''Zentropa Cup'' was held to resume the rich tradition of this competition.

A first “international” competition for football clubs was founded in 1897 in Austro-Hungarian Empire that normally would not meet could take part, though actually almost only clubs from the Empire's three major cities European Cup and Champions League. Last winner of the cup was Vienna Sports Club, one of the oldest and most traditional football clubs of Austria where the cup still remains.

The idea of a European cup competition was shaped after Austro-Hungarian Empire. The centre of this idea were the European Cup for national teams - that unlike the Challenge Cup and the Mitropa Cup would not be annual - was also part of the agreement. 
The first matches were played on August 14 of that year. The competition was between the top professional teams of Central Europe.

Initially two teams each from AC Sparta Prague. In 1929 Italian teams replaced the Yugoslavian ones. The competition was expanded to four teams from each of the competing countries in 1934. Other countries were invited to participate - WW II the cup was competed for in 1939 with only eight teams (two each from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Italy and one each from Romania and Yugoslavia). The level of the competing nations is clearly shown by Italy's two World Cup titles (1934 & 1938), Czechoslovakia's (1934) and Hungary's (1938) World Cup final, and Austria's (1934) and Yugoslavia's (1930) semi-finals. Out of the eleven different teams competing in the first three World Cups, five were part of the Mitropa Cup.

An edition in 1940 was started but abandoned due to World War II. Again, only eight teams competed - three each from Hungary and Yugoslavia and two from Romania. This edition was abandoned before the final match. Hungarian Rapid (which had won on lots after three draws) qualified for the final, but did not meet because Hungary had invaded North-West Romania.

After WW II, the cup was resumed in 1951 initially as Zentropa Cup. Later editions, again under the Mitropa Cup label, lost much of its status because of the introduction of other European club competitions and faced an ongoing decline. By the 1980s it was competed for between the second division champions of the participating countries. It was last played for in 1992 and won by the Yugoslav side, Borac Banja Luka in front of under a thousand spectators.
