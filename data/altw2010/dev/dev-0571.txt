A portrait of Wenham by artist Adam Cullen won the Archibald Prize in 2000. Wenham is signed to Storm Model Management in London.

Has appeared with two of 2001's Best Supporting Actor Nominees. That year's winner was Jim Broadbent, with whom he appeared in Moulin Rouge. The other was Ian McKellen, who reprised his Oscar-nominated role opposite Wenham in ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' and ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King''.

He was also seen in ''Van Helsing'' playing ''300''. Minor roles of Wenham's in overseas films include in ''Brand New Day".
