'''Uma Karuna Thurman''' ( Boston, Massachusetts, SAD, 29. travnja 1970. - ) je američka glumica. 

== Mlade godine ==

Uma Thurman se rodila kao dijete '''Roberta Thurmana''', profesora indijsko-tibetanskih studija, i '''Nene von Schlebrugge''', švedskog modela. Ima troje starije braće; Gandena, Dechena i Mipama, te jednu polusestru, Tayu. Zajedno su proveli jedan dio djetinjstva u Indiji. Kao djevojka je bila povučena i čudna a druga djeca su je zadirkivala. Napustila je srednju školu kako bi se bavila glumom te se preselila u New York.

== Karijera ==

Njen filmski debij imala je 1988. u čak četiri filma, među kojima je najpoznatiji „Opasne veze“ u kojem je nastupila u jednoj sceni u toplesu, zbog čega je imala problema sa ogromnom pažnjom medija. Kasnije je uslijedila romatična krimi drama “Jedna žena, dva muškarca” u kojoj je Robert De Niro bio njen partner. No najveći uspjeh uslijedio je 1994. sa kultnom krimi dramom „Pakleni šund“ za koju je nominirana za Zlatni globus i Oscara. Zanimljivo, redatelj Quentin Tarantino nije isprva htio nju u tom filmu nego Michelle Pfeiffer. Nakon ZF-a „Gattaca“ nanizala je par neuspješnih filmova koju je kritika dočekala na nož, kao što su „''Batman i Robin''“ te „''Osvetnici''“. Pošto je postala majka, uzela je par godina pauze od filma. Za TV dramu „'''Hysterical Blindness'''“ osvojila je Zlatni globus, a Tarantinov dvodijeli film „'''Kill Bill'''“ sa njom je postao iznimno slavan.

Udala se dva puta; njen prvi suprug je bio Gary Oldman (1990.) a drugi Ethan Hawke (1998.), sa kojim je dobila dvoje djece, Mayu Ray i Levon Roan. Sa obojicom se razvela. Pobornica je legalizacije pobačaja, kontrole oružja te financira organizaciju koja pomaže siromašnima. Po religiji je budistkinja.
