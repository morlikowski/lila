==History==
"Ostrów" derives from a Slavic word meaning "island".
On hectares. Ostrów became a royal town, holding a right to organise Saturday fairs and collecting duly on the road from Lublin to Parczew. The fact that it was located on the Polish-Lithuanian route was advantageous for the development of trade and consequently the town.
In 1565 the population of Ostrów numbered about 1800 inhabitants, mostly Poles. It was one of the five most densely populated towns in the Lublin Voivodeship at that time. Apart from Lublin, Kazimierz was another town with bigger population than Ostrów. Łuków and Parczew had nearly the same number of inhabitants. In 1589 in order to increase the colonisation King Sigismund III granted Ostrów a right to organise three fairs a week. In spite of that, the importance of Ostrów decreased in the following decade. Polish-Ukrainian wars, the Swedish Flood as well as numerous conflicts and the greed of starosties resulted in a considerable deterioration of the town. The devastation of Ostrów by the troops of Moszkowski, Capitain of Horse, in 1657 was one of major factors contributing to its collapse.
The number of population decreased to 300 people. The Saxon times witnessed further degradation of the town, in particular the years 1712-1717, when its inhabitants were forced to bear the expense of maintaining troops, although Ostrów was never a battlefield. This situation resulted in the mass exodus of its inhabitants. In 1718 the population of Ostrów numbered only 20.
During the Russian commune. In commune was annexed to Ostrów commune. The commune population numbered over 8000 people in commune. After Poland regained its independence in 1918, the inhabitants of Ostrów pronounced their plea for Ostrów to regain its status as a town.
On the strength of the German-Russian war.
Even a church was not saved. To commemorate this occasion bullets were built in the church walls. The period between the First World War and the Second World War is a period of prosperity. Ostrów was rebuilt and developed (concrete pavements along town squares, a bridge over Tyśmienica river, a school, community house, fourteen new streets). At that time Ostrów was much overpopulated.
In 1928 fire destroyed its buildings. In 1930 there lived 4879 people, including a high percentage of the Jewish population.
The Poles were mostly peasants, whereas the Jews took up crafts and trade. The cultural and economic development of Ostrów was terminated by an outbreak of the Second World War.
