'''Kimberley John Hughes''' (né le 26 janvier 1954), communément appelé '''Kim Hughes''', est un ancien joueur de test et son premier ODI pour l'équipe d'Australie en 1977.

Il fit ses débuts en test contre l'Angleterre à 1978 le capitaine de l'équipe d'Australie, emputée de plusieurs joueurs majeurs qui ont choisi de disputer la World Series Cricket, une lucrative ligue rebelle. Ce choix affecta par la suite ses relations avec Greg Chappell, Rod Marsh et Dennis Lillee, qui avaient fait le choix de disputer la World Series Cricket.

Il partagea par la suite le capitanat avec Greg Chappell, menant l'équipe principalement lors de ses matchs à l'extérieur. En pleurs, il démissionna de son poste de capitaine après une défaite lors du deuxième match de la tournée des Indes occidentales en Australie en 1984-85, et finit avec des statistiques modestes en tant que capitaine en ''test cricket'' : 4 victoires seulement pour 13 défaites et 11 draws.

Non sélectionné pour les Ashes de 1985, il accepta de mener une équipe rebelle en tournée en Afrique du Sud. Il considérait qu'il n'avait plus rien à apporter au cricket australien, alors que beaucoup pensaient qu'il était avant tout victimisé pour sa fidélité à l'Australian Cricket Board durant l'ère des World Series Cricket.

Resté dans les mémoires pour ses statistiques malchanceuses en tant que capitaine, il n'en fut pas moins l'un des meilleurs batteurs de sa génération. Il marqua un 1981-82 au Wisden au neuvième rang des dix meilleures manches réalisées par un batteur.

'''Kimberley John Hughes''' (born Western Australia, Natal and Australia. His first-class debut was at the WACA Ground on 2 November 1975 when he provided a masterful exhibition of strokeplay against New South Wales, making 119 in 166 minutes and becoming the fifth Western Australian batsman to make a century on debut.<ref name="wais">''W.A. Hall of Champions'' inductee booklet. (2006) Published by the Western Australian Institute of Sport</ref>

Hughes' Test debut was versus England at West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1985. Hughes was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1981. He was also a member of the non-World Series Cricket teams of the late 1970s, and it was his involvement with the Australian Cricket Board at the time that would affect his relationship with senior players Greg Chappell, Rod Marsh, and Dennis Lillee.

He came to the Australia captaincy in 1978/79 at the age of 24, when many of the country's most experienced players were aligned with World Series Cricket and in later sharing the captaincy with Greg Chappell, he led Australia mostly on away tours.  Hughes tearfully relinquished the captaincy following Australia's defeat in the second Test against the West Indies in 1984/85 <ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/266824.html Cricinfo - The crying game<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and finished with a disappointing captaincy record of four wins, 13 losses and 11 draws.  He lost his place in the side two Tests later, having scored just two runs in his final four innings, including a golden duck in his last Test innings. 

After being left out of the Ashes squad for the rebel tour side to South Africa. Hughes believed he had nothing left to offer Australian cricket, while many believed that Hughes was victimised for his association with the ACB during the WSC era.

Following the rebel tour, Hughes returned to Western Australia to play first-class cricket but struggled, and returned to South Africa to play for Natal. However, his time ended in acrimony there as well, and after two seasons with Natal he retired from first-class cricket.

Unfairly, he is remembered more for his unlucky captaincy record, but was one of the most talented batsmen of his generation. In the first Test in Melbourne against the West Indies in 1981-82, he faced the fearsome fast-bowling quartet of Andy Roberts, * out of a total of only 198<ref>[http://aus.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1980S/1981-82/WI_IN_AUS/WI_AUS_T1_26-30DEC1981.html Frank Worrell Trophy, 1981/82, 1st Test]</ref><ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/264366.html Cricinfo - Kim's game of his life<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> enabled Australia to win a low-scoring match and take a 1-0 lead in the series.
