'''Wiesbaden''', a city in southwest state of Hesse. The city is on the right, northern, bank of the river Rhine. It lies opposite the city of Mainz on the other side of the river, and is near Frankfurt am Main. Wiesbaden has about 300,400 inhabitants, plus approximately 35,000 U.S. citizens (mostly associated with the American military). The city is also in the Rhein Metropolitan area with Frankfurt and Mainz put together with it, consisting of about 5.8 million people.

==History==
thumb|left|The ''Heidenmauer'' ("Heathen Wall") is the last remnants of the roman aqueduct of ''Aquae Mattiacorum''. It was formerly seen as an uncompleted defense wall, hence the designation.
===Early history===

Evidence of settlements at Wiesbaden date back to the Roman fort in the year 6. The thermal springs of Wiesbaden were first mentioned in German: "Mattiaker"), who were living in this area at the time. The town also appears as Mattiacum in Ptolemy (2.10).

The Alamanni captured the fort c. 260. Later, in the 370s, when the Romans and Alamanni were allied, the Alamanni gained control of the Wiesbaden area and were in charge of its defense against other Germanic tribes.

===Middle ages===

During the 6th century, the Franks displaced the Alamanni. In the 8th century the Franks built a royal yard ("Königshof", "curtis regia"). Sometime between 828 and 830, Einhard mentions "Wisabada". This is the first time that the name, Wiesbaden, is documented. 

In the 1170s the Nassau received the area around Wiesbaden as a Archbishop of Mainz conquered Wiesbaden and burnt it down. Wiesbaden returned to the house of Nassau in 1270. In 1329 the house of Nassau and thereby, Wiesbaden, received the right of Louis the Bavarian.

Due to its participation in the uprisings of the Protestant with the nomination of gymnasium in Idstein. In 1566 the privileges of the city were restored.

The oldest remaining building of the town, the old city hall, was built during 1609 to 1610. No older buildings are preserved due to two fires in 1547 and 1561.

In 1815 the capital of Nassau was moved to Wiesbaden, and the city became the ducal residence. Building activity started in order to give the city a magnificent appearance. Most of the historical centre of Wiesbaden dates back to this time. In the Hesse-Nassau. The deposed duke Adolph of Nassau in 1890 became Grand-Duke of Luxemburg (see "House of Nassau").

===World War II===

Wiesbaden was the Headquarters for Germany’s Wehrkreis XII. This Wehrkreis included The Lorraine, including Nancy; and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The Commander was General der Infanterie Walter Schroth.

Wehrkreis XII was made up of three Bereich Hauptsitze: Koblenz, Mannheim, and Metz.

Bereich Hauptsitze Koblenz was the headquarters for 12 Unterregion-Hauptsitze, namely Worms; Darmstadt; and Luxemburg.

Bereich Hauptsitze Mannheim was the headquarters for 10 Unterregion-Hauptsitze, namely Saarlautern; Saarbrucken; St. Wendel; Zweibrucken; Kaiserslautern; Neustadt (Weinstrasse); Ludwigshafen (Rhein); Mannheim I; Mannheim II; and Heidelberg.

Bereich Hauptsitze Metz was the headquarters for three Unterregion-Hauptsitze; namely Metz; Diedenhofen (Thionville); and Saint-Avold.

===Modern Age===

After Frankfurt am Main is much larger and contains many Hessian government offices. Wiesbaden however suffered much less than Frankfurt from air bombing. There is a constant rumour that the U.S. Army Air Force spared the town due to its scheduled function as a postwar HQ, but recent research from USAAF sources has shown this to be a myth. Wiesbaden's economic and strategic importance simply did not justify more bombing. Wiesbaden was host to the Headquarters, U.S. Air Forces, Europe based at the former Lindsey Air Station from 1953 to 1973.

American U.S. Army's 1st Armored Division is still headquartered at the Wiesbaden Army Airfield, just off the Autobahn toward Frankfurt.  Smaller supporting American kasernes and housing areas are scattered around the city. More Americans are moving in from bases scheduled to be closed such as Darmstadt and Heidelberg.

==Main sights==

The ''Schlossplatz ''("palace square") is situated in the center of the city. There are two outstanding buildings on this square: the ducal palace and the new town hall. The palace was built by heraldic lilies of Wiesbaden.

The Protestant ''Marktkirche ''("market church") was built during 1852 to 1862 in a neo-Gothic style. Its western steeple is 92 m (302 ft) in height, being the highest building of the city. Another building from the regency of Duke Wilhelm is the Luisenplatz, a square named for the Duke's first wife. It is surrounded by Neoclassicist buildings, and in the middle of the square is the Waterloo Napoleon. The monumental ''Kurhaus ''("spa house") (now containing a Wilhelm II.

Apart from the palace in the center, the ducal family had a large palace on the banks of the Rhine, known as Schloss Biebrich. This baroque building was erected in the first half of the 18th century.

==Baths and spa==
Wiesbaden is famous for its thermal springs and spa. Use of the thermal springs is first documented by the Romans. The spring bathing business became important for Wiesbaden near the end of the Goethe, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Richard Wagner, and Johannes Brahms. In 1900, there were 86,100 inhabitants and 126,000 visitors. In those years there were more millionaires living in Wiesbaden than in any other city in Germany.
Gambling always followed bathing ("Kur") en suite. Wiesbaden was famous in the 19th century for its casino ("Spielbank"), once rivaling those of Bad Homburg, Baden-Baden or Monaco. Fyodor Dostoevsky  suffered from an acute gambling compulsion, he lost all his travel-money in Wiesbaden in 1865. He summed up his experience in his 1866 novel "The Gambler" (Russian Игрок), with a fictitious place "Roulettenburg". Bad Homburg also claims to be the showplace. - In 1872, the puritanic prussian dominated imperial government closed down all German gambling houses in 1872. Wiesbaden casino [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spielbank_Wiesbaden] was reopened in 1949.
