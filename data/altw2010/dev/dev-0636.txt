'''''Bleed the Dream''''' er et  amerikansk hardcore-rock

==Biografi==
På nyåret i 2003 var Bleed the Dream, slik navnet deres antyder ("å blø en drøm"). Dette er en ordvending som antyder et konsepts drømmefase, før selve starten på dets tilblivelse. Keith Thompson hadde forlatt Baltimore året tidligere for å forfølge sine musikalske drømmer. I februar 2004 forlot også vennen Brandon Thomas Baltimore for å se hva Thompson hadde vært så oppglødd over i LA. Der møtte de to nemlig de to andre medlemmene i bandet, og Bleed the Dream var en realitet våren 2003. Fire musikere hadde kommet sammen i deres kjærlighet til ytringen gjennom musikkens poesi.

Ut fra hva de hadde lært fra tidligere, som medlemmer av "store band på små scener", var spranget til LA sjansen for de to østkystguttene til å bli hørt. Hvis du vil klare deg i musikkbransjen, må du turnére, du trenger fans, var tanken. Det neste året finpusset bandet sound'en sin og fikk stablet seg inn i en van, og de jobbet seg i vei fra by til by. Denne innsatsen betalte seg fort, da de fikk en plass på Warped Tour gjennom god, gammeldags nettoppbygging og uten et album å skilte med. De ble bedt tilbake til Warped Tour offisielt igjen i 2004 og 2005.

I 2004 startet Bleed the Dreams egen Dave Aguilera sitt eget plateselskap, Maphia Records, og slapp deretter to EP'er: den rockede "Awake" på Noize Pollution, og den akustiske "Asleep". De slapp også senere en DVD, "No Apologies" til minne om de gamle CKY-filmene. DVD'en ble redigert av Scott Gottlieb fra deler av bildemateriale fra turnéen og fra fans som filmet konsertene deres.

Suksessen og den raskt voksende fanmengden noterte seg hos Warped Tour-skaperen Kevin Lyman. Idét Lyman innså at Bleed the Dream var inne på noe rent musikalsk, skapte han sitt eget plateselskap (Warcon Enterprises), hyret bandet og slapp deres første album i full lengde, "Built by Blood" i mai 2005.

Våren 2005 gav dem en plass på Taste of Chaos-turnéen, som inneholdt flere store navn som The Used, Story of the Year og My Chemical Romance. Scott Gottlieb var ingen tilhenger av det harde turnélivet, så bandet spilte og dedikerte hvert show til hans helbred. Dessverre, idét bandet virkelig var på vei oppover, ble Gottlieb syk. Et år tidligere, våren 2004, falt Gottlieb ned fra scenen, og bandet avbrøt konserten for å få ham til sykehuset. Han ble der diagnostisert med blodkreft. Han tapte sin korte kamp mot kreften den 10. april 2005, bare to uker før utgivelsen av "Built by Blood". Releasepartyet på "Ottobar" i Baltimore, Maryland ble en tårefylt triumf. 

Bleed the Dream fortsatte ut Taste of Chaos-turnéen 2005, og tok pause i desember for å skrive nytt materiale og for å finne en ny, permanent trommeslager. Dette skulle vise seg å bli Tom Breyfogle. Senere forlot også vokalist Brandon Thomas bandet.

I april 2006 fungerte de som supportband for Story of the Year og Stretch Arm Strong i deres Storbritannia-turné. Etterpå dro de til Japan med bandene Never Heard of It, Army of Freshmen og Crowned King.

I august 2006 presenterte bandet to nye demoer på MySpace-siden deres. Intenasjonen var å "vise frem" sin nye sanger, og å la fansen få en sniktitt på deres nye materiale. Sangene var tilgjengelige for en kort periode.

==Utskiftninger i bandet==
I januar 2006 kom Tom Breyfogle fra Ohio inn i bandet som permanent trommeslager. Hans første to turnéer var i utvalgte byer i USA og Canada med Hawthorne Heights på den første delen og Funeral for a Friend på den andre. Etter dette dro de til Canada for å føre sin egen headlining-turné.

Den 24. mai 2006 kom den offisielle ærklæringen på at Brandon Thomas hadde forlatt bandet grunnet uenigheter og forskjeller angående bandets utvikling. Siden da har Mark Holmes fungert som Thomas' arvtager. I september 2006 bekreftet Brandon hans nye prosjekt, Phantom Communique i Baltimore.

'''''Bleed the Dream''''' is an American rock band from Southern California. They broke up in 2007 after releasing their new album "Killer Inside" with a new line-up. 

== History ==

=== Formation to ''Built by Blood'' (2003 - 2005) ===
Keith Thompson had left Baltimore for Los Angeles a year earlier to follow his musical career. A month into 2003, Brandon Thomas left Baltimore to after speaking with Keith. Bleed the Dream had been formed by spring of that year.

They went to LA. For the next year, the band polished their sound and piled in a van, touring their way from city to city. They garnered them a spot on the Warped Tour without even an album under their belts. They were asked back to join Warped Tour officially in 2004 and 2005.

In 2004, Bleed The Dreams's guitarist, Dave Aguilera, created his own label, No Apologies" reminiscent of the CKY videos. The DVD was edited by Scott Gottlieb from pieces of tour footage and behind the scene fan cameras.

Their success and rapid-growing fan base was noted by Warped Tour creator, WARCON Enterprises LLC, signed the band, and released their first full-length album, "Built By Blood" in May 2005. 

Spring of 2005 landed Bleed the Dream on the Taste of Chaos tour featuring The Used and My Chemical Romance. Unfortunately, as their star was rising, Scott became sick and weak, unable to handle the rough life on the road. A year earlier, he fell down during a performance while on a national tour. The band cut their set short to rush him to the hospital. Scott was diagnosed as having leukemia. He lost his short battle with cancer on April 10, 2005, only two weeks before the band released "Built by Blood". Their CD release party at the Ottobar in Baltimore, Maryland on April 23, was tearful and triumphant in the same breath. Friends and family came out to pay their respects to Scott and support the band in the next phase of their life without him.

=== ''Killer Inside'' (2006) ===
Bleed the Dream finished out 2005 by joining Taste Of Chaos Europe with headliners The Used and Story of the Year. In December, the band took some time off to write and audition new drummers. They now have a permanent drummer, Tom, who has recently entered the band. Brandon Thomas was soon let go from the band and replaced by Mark Holmes, former lead singer of the now-defunct band Like Yesterday.

In July 2006, the band recorded a new album in Canada with producers GGGarth Richardson and Ben Kaplan. The 13 new tracks recorded became the highly anticipated second record, "Killer Inside." In late 2006, the band finished filming a music video for the song "Closer," the first single off their new album, "Killer Inside". The video shows band members playing grim reaper type stalkers to the lead singer, and finishes with the band playing paramedics to their bloody lead singer. The album also features tracks "It Takes A Fall," "Tell Someone Who Cares," and "Vampires Don't Kill For the Money."

=== Band Break-Up (2007) ===
On 9/24/07 Bleed the Dream posted the following bulletin on MySpace regarding their break-up

<blockquote>''"Hi Dave from Bleed the Dream here, After many years of ups and downs were calling it quits. It's been such a rollercoaster ride from the beginning, from sneaking onto The Warped Tour in 2003 and pissing off its founder Kevin Lyman so bad that he later signed us to his label "Warcon Records". We have traveled the world many times and made so many cool friends along the way, we like to think of Bleed the Dream as more than just a band but a family, we have been touched so much by all the love and support you gave us and Scotts family when we lost him to cancer in 2005 and we in return have tried to give that back to you on and off stage. As the saying goes everything must come to an End but that doesn't mean we can't remember all the good times we have enjoyed together, I'll never forget the first time we played on the Kevin Says stage in 2003 when we had no merch no tent no nothing Ha Ha. Then 2 years later we're playing at the Taste of Chaos in front of 15,000 people (we almost shit our pants). Its because of you that we have been able to make our dreams come true and we could never thank you enough for that. But we think most of all what we will take away from this whole experience is how much it made us grow up and see the world in a better way, we watched our friend Scott Gottlieb go into the studio and record drums everyday sicker then we hope to never be, and that changed us forever! We miss our friend and that being said were gonna dedicate these last 2 shows to Scott and his family and all the friends and fans that are going through the same situation as we did. I truly believe Scott's still with us in spirit, So Scott we got a surprise for you!!! I just got off the phone with Brandon Thomas and he's coming to Alaska to sing all the songs on "Built by Blood & Awake" like you would have wanted it… We feel so blessed to have met Tom he has been such a good compliment to Scott's drumming and a great drummer himself and an over all great person. Also I think it was great that Mark dropped everything to come join our band and sing on our last record "Killer Inside"…I'm glad we will all be in Alaska as friends to the end playing songs with Brandon from Awake/Asleep and Built by Blood and songs from Killer Inside with Mark on vocals... But don't feel like your never gonna see us again, We're all musicians to the end, Tom and I are in a new band called "A Permanent Holiday" maybe Keith will join ya know he can't live without me Ha Ha. Scott's probably jamming with Kurt and Jimmy... Brandon's got a new band called Phantom Communique, Marks back in the fashion industry and doing a Solo record.."''</blockquote>

=== Reformation (2008 - Present) ===
On May 18 2008 they announced on the there myspace this blog:

<blockquote>''"So everyone keeps asking about the rumors well truth be told I (Dave) have been writing a bunch of new songs Keith has been writing a bunch of new songs and drum roleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee YES BRANDON has been Writing a bunch of new songs. The 3 of us will get together sometime soon make mad passionate love and then hash out all our ideas. I can't say there will be another BTD record or not but I will tell you this that the only way we would do another one is if it was slammin!!!!

P.S. here is a little secret "were going back to our roots" BUILT BY BLOOD style...

k see ya, have a good weekend 

And oya suck it I know I have bad grammar!!!

Dave... "''</blockquote>

On June 11, 2008 Brandon posted a bulletin on myspace promoting his new band, Phantom Communique, and at the end said something very brief about the possible Bleed the Dream reunion...
