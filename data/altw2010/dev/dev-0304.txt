'''Major Sir George Cumine Strahan''' KCMG (British military officer and colonial administrator, best known as the Governor of Tasmania from 1881&ndash;1886.

==Early life and military career==
Strahan was born on 9 December 1838 in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, Scotland in the United Kingdom. After graduating from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he joined the Royal Artillery corps of the British Army as a lieutenant in 1857.

==Colonial career==
Strahan was assigned as ''Prime Minister) and Sir Henry Storks. When Storks was appointed Sir Patrick Grant, until 1868 when he was made chief secretary of Gold Coast (governor 1874-1876) and the governor 1876-1880).

==Governor of Tasmania==
Strahan was appointed Governor of Tasmania in April 1880, and was knighted shortly after. He did not, however, take up the appointment until arriving in Hobart in December 1881. The long delay was caused by Strahan acting as administrator of the Sir Hercules Robinson.

Strahan was a popular governor in Tasmania, regarded as attentive to education, health and rural industry. His own health was occasionally questioned, and the spells of illness he suffered during his term were put down to having spent so many years in the tropical climates of the Caribbean and Africa.

'''George Cumine Strahan''' (britisk militæroffiser og koloniadministrator, best kjent som guvernør av Tasmania fra 1881 til 1886.

Strahan ble født i Fraserburgh i Aberdeenshire i Skottland. Etter at han utdannet seg ved Royal Military Academy i Woolwich i London, sluttet han seg til Royal Artillery–korpset i British Army som løytnant i 1857.

Han ble ''Windward Islands/Barbados (guvernør 1876–80). 

Strahan ble utnevnt til guevrnør i Tasmania i april 1880 og ble adlet kort tid etterpå. Men han inntok ikke stillingen før han ankom Hobart i desember 1881. Den lange forsinkelsen skyldtes at Strahan fungerte som guvernør for Kappkolonien og høykommisær for det sørlige Afrika til Hercules Robinson ankom.

Han var en populær guvernør i Tasmania og regnet som oppmerksom mot utdanning, helse og jordbruksindustrien. Det ble til tider stilt spørsmål ved hans egen helse, og periodene med sykdom i løpet av hans periode skyldtes at han hadde tilbrakt så mange år i tropisk klima i Karibia og Afrika.
