'''Ebenezer Henderson''' (Scottish divine, was born at the Linn near Dunfermline, and died at Mortlake.

He was the youngest son of an agricultural labourer, and after three years schooling spent some time at watchmaking and as a shoemaker's apprentice. In East India Company would not allow British vessels to convey missionaries to India--Henderson and his colleague went to Denmark to await the chance of a passage to Serampur, then a Danish port.

Being unexpectedly delayed, and having begun to preach in Lapland (1807-1808), Iceland (1814-1815) and the mainland of Denmark and part of Germany (1816). During most of this time he was an agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society.

On October 6, 1811 he formed the first Congregational church in Sweden. In 1818, after a visit to England, he travelled in company with Paterson through Russia as far south as Tiflis, but, instead of settling as was proposed at Astrakhan, he retraced his steps, having resigned his connection with the Bible Society owing to his disapproval of a translation of the Scriptures, which had been made in Turkish.

In 1822 he was invited by Prince Alexander (Galitzin) to assist the Russian Bible Society in translating the Scriptures into various languages spoken in the Russian empire. After twenty years of foreign labour Henderson returned to England, and in 1825 was appointed tutor of the Mission College, Gosport.
