==Etymology==

Although the precise origin of the Hebrew name for Jerusalem (''Yerushalayim'') remains uncertain, scholars have proposed a variety of interpretations. Some say it means "legacy of peace" ‚Äî a combination of ''yerusha'' (legacy) and ''Akkadian name of the city appears as ''Uru≈°alim'', a cognate of the Hebrew ''Ir Shalem''. Some believe there is a connection to ''Shalim'', the beneficent deity known from Ugaritic myths as the personification of dusk.<ref></ref> 

Lot.<ref name="sharing"></ref> Upon arrival, he asked the king and high priest monotheist). This encounter between Melchizedek and Abraham was commemorated by renaming the city in their honor: the name ''Yeru'' (derived from ''Yireh'', the name Abraham gave to the Temple Mount, was combined with ''Shalem'',<ref name="sharing" /> producing ''Yeru-Shalem'', meaning the "city of Shalem," or "founded by Shalem." If ''shalem'' means "complete" or "without defect, "Yerushalayim would mean the "perfect city," or "the city of he who is perfect".<ref>Sitchin, Zecharia, ''The Cosmic Code'', Avon 1998</ref> The ending ''-im'' indicates the plural in Hebrew grammar and ''-ayim'' the dual, leading to an interpretation of the name as representing two facets of the city, such as two hills.<ref></ref><ref> (see [http://books.google.com/books?id=Nf4QAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA251&dq=jerusalem+name+dual&ie=ISO-8859-1 here])</ref> The pronunciation of the last syllable as ''-ayim'' appears to be a late development, which had not yet appeared at the time of the Egyptian records is the first reference to Jerusalem.<ref> G.Johannes Botterweck, Helmer Ringgren (eds.)

King David reigned until 970 BCE. He was succeeded by his son Solomon,<ref name="wwbible"></ref>  who built 
the Holy Temple on Mount Moriah.  ten northern tribes split off to form the Kingdom of Israel. Under the leadership of the House of David and Solomon, Jerusalem remained the capital of the Kingdom of Judah.<ref name="bu2-2"></ref>

As Rome became stronger it installed Herod as a Jewish client king. Herod the Great, as he was known, devoted himself to developing and beautifying the city. He built walls, towers and palaces, and expanded the Temple Mount, buttressing the courtyard with blocks of stone weighing up to 100 tons. Under Herod, the area of the Temple Mount doubled in size.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name="wwbible" /> In 6 CE, the city, as well as much of the surrounding area, came under direct Roman rule as the Jewish-Roman war, the Great Jewish Revolt, which resulted in the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. In 130 CE Bar Kochba revolt. The Romans succeeded in recapturing the city in 135 CE and as a punitive measure Hadrian banned the Jews from entering it. Hadrian renamed the entire Iudaea Province ''Syria Palaestina'' after the biblical Philistines in an attempt to de-Judaize the country.<ref name="erp-places"></ref><ref></ref> Enforcement of the ban on Jews entering Aelia Capitolina continued until the 4th century CE.

In the five centuries following the Bar Kokhba revolt, the city remained under Roman then Byzantine rule. During the 4th century, the Roman Emperor Constantine I constructed Christian sites in Jerusalem such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Jerusalem reached a peak in size and population at the end of the Second Temple Period: The city covered two square kilometers (0.8 sq mi.) and had a population of 200,000<ref></ref><ref name="erp-places"/> From the days of Constantine until the 7th century, Jews were banned from Jerusalem.<ref></ref>

====Ottoman rule====
In 1517, Jerusalem and environs fell to the Ottoman Turks, who remained in control until 1917.<ref name="century1" /> With the occupation of Jerusalem by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1831, foreign missions and consulates began to establish a foothold in the city. In the 1860s, new neighborhoods began to go up outside the Old City walls to house pilgrims and relieve the intense overcrowding and poor sanitation inside the city. The Russian Compound and Mishkenot Sha'ananim were founded in 1860.<ref></ref> According to the Prussian consul, the population in 1845 was 16,410, with 7,120 Jews, 5,000 Muslims, 3,390 Christians, 800 Turkish soldiers and 100 Europeans.<ref>''Jerusalem: Illustrated History Atlas'' Martin Gilbert, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1978, p. 37</ref>

=== Division and reunification ===

thumb|right|Israeli policemen meet a [[Jordanian Legionnaire near the Mandelbaum Gate.]]
At the end of the war, Israel and Jordan (then known as Transjordan) divided Jerusalem. The 1949 Armistice Agreements, signed between Israel and its neighbors, established a ceasefire line that cut through the center of the city, and left Mount Scopus as an Israeli exclave. Barbed wire and checkpoints divided the city, and military skirmishes frequently threatened the ceasefire. After the establishment of the State of Israel, Jerusalem was declared its capital. Jordan formally annexed East Jerusalem in 1950, subjecting it to Jordanian law, in a move that was recognized only by Pakistan.<ref name=birzeit>{{cite web

Jordan assumed control of the holy places in the Old City. Contrary to the terms of the agreement, Israelis were denied access to Jewish holy sites, many of which were desecrated, and only allowed very limited access to Christian holy sites.<ref>Martin Gilbert, [http://www.mefacts.com/cache/html/wall-ruling_/11362.htm "Jerusalem: A Tale of One City"], ''The New Republic'', Nov. 14, 1994</ref><ref></ref> During this period, the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque underwent major renovations.<ref></ref>

However, the takeover of East Jerusalem was met with international criticism. Following the passing of Israel's a resolution that declared the law "a violation of international law" and requested all member states to withdraw all remaining embassies from the city.<ref></ref> 

The status of the city, and especially its holy places, remains a core issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some Jewish settlers seeking to claim Jewish holy sites and archaeological sites in East Jerusalem have erected settlements in former Palestinian homes or on land confiscated from Palestinian villagers. Meanwhile, some prominent Islamic leaders have insisted that Jews have no historical connection to Jerusalem.<ref></ref> Palestinians ultimately envision East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state,<ref></ref><ref></ref> and the city's eventual borders have been the subject of several bilateral talks.

==Geography==
thumb|View of Jerusalem Forest from Yad Vashem
Jerusalem is situated around  on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judean Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus (North East). The elevation of the Old City is approximately 760 m (2,500 feet).<ref></ref> The whole of Jerusalem is surrounded by valleys and dry riverbeds (''wadis''), although those to the north are less pronounced than those on the other sides.

Three of the most prominent valleys in the region, the Kidron, Hinnom, and Tyropoeon Valleys, intersect in an area just south of the Old City of Jerusalem.<ref name="bergsohn"></ref> The Kidron Valley runs just to the east of the Old City and separates the Mount of Olives from the city proper. Along the southern side of old Jerusalem is the Valley of Hinnom, a steep ravine associated in Biblical eschatology with the concept of Gehenna or Hell.<ref></ref>

A third valley commenced in the northwest near the present-day location of Damascus Gate, ran south-southeasterly through the center of the Old City down to the Pool of Siloam, and divided the lower part into two hills, the Temple Mount to the east, and the rest of the city to the west (the lower and the upper cities described by Josephus). Today, this valley, the Tyropoeon Valley, is mostly hidden from view due to the amount of debris that has accumulated within the ravine over the past few millennia.<ref name="bergsohn" />

Jerusalem is <ref></ref>  east of lowest body of water on Earth. Neighboring cities and towns include Bethlehem and Beit Jala to the south, Abu Dis and Ma'ale Adumim to the east, Mevaseret Zion to the west, and Ramallah and Giv'at Ze'ev to the north.<ref> (Image located [http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~maeira/About%20us/Introduction/Map_Jerusalem_K_Menahem_small.jpg here])</ref><ref name="map"> (See map 9 for Jerusalem)</ref><ref> (Image located [http://www.poica.org/editor/case_studies/GJ_2006.jpg here])</ref>

Most of the Israeli Mediterranean coast can travel eastward and settle over the city.<ref name="friction" /><ref></ref>

==Demographics==

In May 2007, Jerusalem had a population of 743,000 - 68% were Jewish, 30% Muslim, and 2% Christian. The population density was .<ref name="cbs" /><ref></ref> According to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Palestinian birth rate, and Jewish residents leaving.  The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/09/26/mideast.jerusalem.reut/index.html "Arab population growth outpaces Jews in Jerusalem"] Reuters, September 26, 2000</ref>

In 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the Haredi Jewish communities. Consequently, the total fertility rate in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.<ref name="cbs" />

In 2005, the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%) &mdash; similar to Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is  42%.<ref name="cbs" /> This would seem to corroborate the observation that the percentage of Jews in Jerusalem has declined over the past four decades. In 1967, Jews accounted for 74 percent of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down nine percent.<ref></ref> Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city. Many people are moving to the suburbs and coastal cities in search of cheaper housing and a more secular lifestyle.<ref name="Jewish-drop"></ref>

Demographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the Jerusalem Development Authority proposed expanding city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.<ref></ref>

====Criticism of urban planning====
Critics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Israel say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction.<ref>Allison Hodgkins, "The Judaization of Jerusalem - Israeli Policies Since 1967"; PASSIA publication No. 96, December 1996, (English, Pp. 88)</ref> According to a World Bank report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighborhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Palestinians in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and "the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators" than Jewish violators of the permit process.<ref name = "worldbank"/> In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the City of David archaelogical park in the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan (adjacent to the Old City),<ref>Meron Rapoport.[http://news.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=530047&contrassID=1 Land lords]; Haaretz, January 20, 2005</ref> and the Museum of Tolerance on Mamilla cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).<ref>Esther Zandberg.[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/825662.html "The architectural conspiracy of silence"]; Haaretz, Februrary 24, 2007</ref> The Israeli government has also expropriated Palestinian land for the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier.<ref name="worldbank">[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WestBankrestrictions9Mayfinal.pdf "Movement and Access Restrictions in the West Bank: Uncertainty and Inefficiency"]; World Bank Technical Team, May 9, 2007</ref> Opponents view such urban planning moves as geared towards the Judaization of Jerusalem.<ref>Allison Hodgkins.

==Local government==
thumb|left|[[Safra Square, Jerusalem City Hall]]

The Jerusalem City Council is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints six deputies. The current mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, was elected in 2003.<ref name="corridors"></ref> Apart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor was Teddy Kollek, who spent twenty-eight years &mdash; six consecutive terms &mdash; in office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public.<ref name="corridors" /> Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.<ref></ref> 
The headquarters of the Jerusalem Municipality and the mayor's office are at Safra Square (''Kikar Safra'') on Jaffa Road. The new municipal complex, comprising two modern buildings and ten renovated historic buildings surrounding a large plaza, opened in 1993.<ref></ref> The city falls under the Jerusalem District, with Jerusalem as the district's capital.

==Political status==
thumb|right|The [[Knesset Building in Jerusalem, home to the legislative branch of the Israeli government]]
On Prime Minister, Israeli government ‚Äî legislative, judicial, and executive ‚Äî have resided there.<ref></ref> At the time of the proclamation, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel''.<ref name="basiclaw"></ref>

The status of a "united Jerusalem" as Israel's "eternal capital"<ref></ref><ref name="ben-gurion"></ref> has been a matter of immense controversy within the international community. Although some countries maintain consulates in Jerusalem, and two maintain embassies in Jerusalem suburbs, all embassies are located outside of the city proper, mostly in Tel Aviv.<ref name="foreign-embassies"></ref><ref></ref>
thumb||left|widthpx|The [[Supreme Court of Israel.]]
The non-binding United Nations Security Council Resolution 478, passed on August 20, 1980, declared that the Basic Law was "null and void and must be rescinded forthwith." Member states were advised to withdraw their diplomatic representation from the city as a punitive measure. Most of the remaining countries with embassies in Jerusalem complied with the resolution by relocating them to Tel Aviv, where many embassies already resided prior to Resolution 478. Currently there are no embassies located within the city limits of Jerusalem, although there are embassies in Mevaseret Zion, on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and four consulates in the city itself.<ref name="foreign-embassies" /> In 1995, the United States Congress had planned to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem with the passage of the Jerusalem Embassy Act.<ref></ref> However, U.S. President George W. Bush has argued that Congressional resolutions regarding the status of Jerusalem are merely advisory. The Constitution reserves foreign relations as an executive power, and as such, the US embassy is still in Tel Aviv.<ref></ref> 
thumb|The [[Orient House]]
Israel's most prominent governmental institutions, including the ''Supreme Court,<ref></ref> and the official residences of the President and Prime Minister, are located in Jerusalem. Prior to the creation of the State of Israel, Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of the British Mandate, which included present-day Israel and Jordan.<ref>Jerusalem as administrative capital of the British Mandate:

*</ref> From 1949 until 1967, West Jerusalem served as Israel's capital but was not recognized as such internationally because UN General Assembly Resolution 194 envisaged Jerusalem as an international city. As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control. On June 27, 1967, the government of Levi Eshkol extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.<ref></ref> In 1988, Israel ordered the closure of  Orient House, home of the Arab Studies Society, but also the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, for security reasons. The building reopened in 1992 as a Palestinian guesthouse.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The Oslo Accords stated that the final status of Jerusalem would be determined by negotiations with the Palestinian National Authority, which regards East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.<ref name="umd" />

==Religious significance==

Jerusalem plays an important role in  churches, and 73 mosques within the city.<ref></ref> Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy.
thumb|The Western Wall, known as the Kotel
Jerusalem has been sacred to the Jews since the 10th century BCE,<ref name="1000BCE" /> as the site of "Holy of Holies".<ref name="returning"></ref> As prescribed in the Mishna and codified in the ''Shulchan Aruch'', daily prayers are recited while facing towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Many Jews have "Mizrach" plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer.<ref name="returning" /><ref>The Jewish injunction to pray toward Jerusalem comes in the ''Orach Chayim'' section of ''Shulchan Aruch'' (94:1) ‚Äî "When one rises to pray anywhere in the Diaspora, he should face towards the Land of Israel, directing himself also toward Jerusalem, the Temple, and the Holy of Holies."</ref>

Jerusalem is considered the third-holiest city in Islam.<ref name="3rd-holiest"/> For approximately a year, before it was permanently switched to the prayer) for Muslims was Jerusalem.<ref></ref> The city's lasting place in Islam, however, is primarily due to Night of Ascension (c. 620 CE). Muslims believe Muhammad was miraculously transported one night from Heaven to meet previous Qur'an's ''Surat al-Isra'' notes the destination of Muhammad's journey as ''al-Aqsa'' (the farthest) mosque,<ref>From 17:1)</ref> in reference to the location in Jerusalem. Today, the Temple Mount is topped by two Islamic landmarks intended to commemorate the event ‚Äî al-Aqsa Mosque, derived from the name mentioned in the Qur'an, and the Dome of the Rock, which stands over the Foundation Stone, from which Muslims believe Muhammad ascended to Heaven.<ref></ref>

==Culture==
thumb|right|The [[Shrine of the Book, housing the Dead Sea Scrolls, at the Israel Museum]]

Although Jerusalem is known primarily for its religious significance, the city is also home to many artistic and cultural venues. The Israel Museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year, approximately one-third of them tourists.<ref name="il-mus-about"></ref> The 20-acre museum complex comprises several buildings featuring special exhibits and extensive collections of Judaica, archaeological findings, and Israeli and European art. The Dead Sea scrolls, discovered in the mid-twentieth century in the Qumran caves near the Dead Sea, are housed in the Museum's Shrine of the Book.<ref></ref> The Youth Wing, which mounts changing exhibits and runs an extensive art education program, is visited by 100,000 children a year. The museum has a large outdoor sculpture garden, and a scale-model of the Second Temple was recently moved from the Holyland Hotel to a new location on the museum grounds.<ref name="il-mus-about" /> The Rockefeller Museum, located in East Jerusalem, was the first archaeological museum in the Middle East. It was built in 1938 during the British Mandate.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The Islamic Museum on the Temple Mount, established in 1923, houses many Islamic artifacts, from tiny kohl  flasks and rare manuscripts to giant marble columns.<ref></ref>

Yad Vashem, Israel's national memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, houses the world's largest library of Holocaust-related information,<ref></ref> with an estimated 100,000 books and articles. The complex contains a state-of-the-art museum that explores the genocide of the Jews through exhibits that focus on the personal stories of individuals and families killed in the Holocaust and an art gallery featuring the work of artists who perished. Yad Vashem also commemorates the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis, and honors the Righteous among the Nations.<ref name="yad-about"></ref> The Museum on the Seam, which explores issues of coexistence through art is situated on the road dividing eastern and western Jerusalem.<ref name=seam>{{cite web
