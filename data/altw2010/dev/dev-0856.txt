'''Jeff Ament''' (született Jeffrey Allen Ament néven a montanai Havre városban, 1963. március 10-én) amerikai basszusgitáros és Mike McCready-vel, valamint Stone Gossard-dal együtt a Pearl Jam rockbanda alapító tagja. Jeff híres basszusgitáros, különösen a bundnélküli és a 12 húros basszusgitáron, valamint nagybőgőn való játéka miatt ismert és elismert. 

==Korai évei==

Ament egy vidéki kisvárosban, Big Sandy-ben nőtt fel, amelynek 7000-nél is kevesebb lakosa van. Tinédzserként kezdett basszusgitározni, The Clash és The Police lemezeket hallgatva. Miután otthagyta a missoulai ''University of Montana''-t, az akkori együttesével, a ''Deranged Diction''-nel Seattle-be költözött az 1980-as évek elején. Több seattle-i zenésztársával – mint Stone Gossard, Mark Arm és Steve Turner – ismertségre tett szert, így 1984-ben felkérték, hogy csatlakozzon az új együttesükbe, a Green River-be. Sokan a Green River-t tartják az első grunge bandának. Az együttes komoly helyi elismertségnek örvendett, de a tagok közötti viszony megromlása miatt 1987-ben feloszlott.

Ament és Gossard a helyi "celebrity" Stone útjai ekkor majdnem elváltak, de végül a Chris Cornell által kezdeményezett Andy Wood-tribute projekt Temple of the Dog által együtt folytatták karrierjüket. Ebben a projektben szerepelt Mike McCready és Eddie Vedder is, akikkel 1990-ben a Pearl Jam együttest hozták létre.

==Pearl Jam==

Jeff az együttesben kiveszi a részét a dalírásból is, a banda egyik legnagyobb slágerét, a ''Jeremy''-t ő írta csakúgy, mint a ''Nothingman'' című dalt is. A következő daloknak a szövegét is ő írta: ''Pilate'', ''Low Light'', ''Gods' Dice'', ''Nothing As It Seems'', ''Help Help'', ''Other Side'', és ''Sweet Lew''.

Egy interjúban így nyilatkozott:

==Egyéb munkássága==

Ament szerepelt a '92-es Facérok című filmben, ahol önmagát alakította a főszereplő Matt Dillon rockbandájában.

Gossard-dal együtt jelent meg, és tanúskodott a rajongók jogainak védelme érdekében.

<blockquote>I have to be able to feel the bass. I've worked hard with our producers to make sure that when you play our records on your stereo, you can feel the bass. You might not necessarily be able to hear it all the time, but if you turn it up you can feel the movement in the low end -- that it's moving the song. And when it's not there, it should be creating a dynamic.<ref name="godfather"/></blockquote>
