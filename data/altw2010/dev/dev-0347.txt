'''Vouti''' on Pohjoismaissa  kuninkaan virkamiehestä käytetty nimitys. Keskiajalla voudit kuuluivat ylhäisaateliin. Heidän tehtäviään oli tuolloin periä kuninkaalle menevät verot sekä toimia käskynhaltijana tietyllä alueella tai linnassa linnanisännän apulaisena. Esimerkiksi Turun linnanvoutina toimi vuonna 1515 laamanni Klaus Henrikinpojan poika Krister.

Voudin asema saattoi houkutella haltijansa väärinkäytöksiin. Vuonna 1589 kuninkaalle Tukholmaan toimitetussa ''Suuressa valituksessa'' kerrotaan voudeista seuraavaa: "''Päivittäin tapahtuvin laittomin toimin, väkivallalla ja vääryydellä Ruotsin kruunulle suureksi vahingoksi ja meille ikuiseksi surkeudeksi ovat knaapit, voudit ja voudinkirjurit, nimismiehet, verokuntamiehet ja rikkaat talonpojat näinä kalliina aikoina rikastuneet''". Jo aikaisemmin, vuonna 1581 oli Juhana III antanut määräyksen erityisistä tutkintakäräjistä sen selvittämiseksi olivatko eräät voudit ja voudinkirjurit pettäneet häntä tai hänen alamaisiaan.

Myöhemmin voudilla voidaan tarkoittaa eräänlaista tilanhoitajaa tai toisaalta tiettyyn tehtävään nimettyä luottamushenkilöä (Seitsemässä veljeksessä kyläläisten keskuudestaan valitseman ''jahtivoudin'' ja toisaalta Viertolan ''kartanon voudin''. Jos vouteja oli samalla alueella monta, heidän nimensä perään laitettiin numero 1 (I) ensimmäisen arvon vouti, numero 2 (II) toisen arvon vouti jne. Suurin voutien määrä oli Isossa-Britanniassa, jossa alin vouti oli numerolla 524.

Nykyisin paikallisena ulosottomiehenä Suomessa toimii kihlakunnanvouti ja Ruotsissa kruununvouti.

'''Bailiff''' (from Late Latin ''baiulivus'', adjectival form of ''baiulus'') is a governor or custodian (cf. bail); a legal officer to whom some degree of authority, care or jurisdiction is committed. Bailiffs are of various kinds and their offices and duties vary greatly.

==Medieval bailiffs==
===British Isles===
The term was first applied in hundred. The county within which the sheriff exercises his jurisdiction is still called his bailiwick, while the term bailiff is retained as a title by the chief magistrates of various towns and the keepers of Royal castles, as the High Bailiff of Westminster, the Bailiff of Dover Castle, etc. Under the manorial system a bailiff was in charge of superintending the cultivation of the manor (see Walter of Henley).

===Holland and Flanders===
The rank bailiff was used in Flanders, Holland, Henegouwen, Zeeland and in North of France. The bailiff was a civil servant who represented the ruler in town and country. In Flanders the Count usually appointed the bailiff and in France the King. The position originates from France when King Philip II Augustus installed the first bailiff. In the northern parts of continental Europe this position was known as "Baljuw" a direct derivative from the French word "Bailli" but also words were used as "drost", "drossaard" (Brabant), "amman" (Brussels), "meier" (Leuven, Asse), "schout" (Antwerp, 's-Hertogenbosch, Turnhout), "amtmann" and "ammann" (Germany, Switzerland, Austria).

===France ''ancien régime''===

Under the ancien régime in France, the baliy was the king's representative in the '''bailliage''' (bailiwick), charged with the application of justice and control of the administration.  In southern France, the term generally used was ''sénéchal'' who held office in the '''sénéchaussée'''.

The administrative network of ''baillages'' was established in the 13th century over the king's land (the ''domaine royal''), notably by Philippe Auguste.  They were based on the earlier medieval fiscal and tax divisions (the "baillie") which had been used by earlier sovereign princes (such as the Duke of Normandy). The creation of the royal ''bailliages'' reduced prior existing judicial courts to a subaltern rank; these lower courts were called:
* ''prévôtés royales'' supervised by a ''prévôt'' appointed and paid by the ''bailli''
* or (as was the case in Normandy) ''vicomtés'' supervised  by a ''vicomte'' (the position could be held by non-nobles)
* or (in parts of northern France) châtellenies supervised by a ''châtelain'' (the position could be held by non-nobles)
* or, in the south, ''vigueries'' or ''baylies'' supervised by a ''viguier'' or a ''bayle''.

The court or tribunal of the ''bailliage'' was presided by a ''lieutenant général du bailli''.  Tribunals in ''bailliages'' and ''sénéchaussées'' were the first court of appeal for lower courts, but the court of first instance for affairs involving the nobility.  To appeal their decisions, one turned to the regional parlements.  In an effort to reduce the case load in the parlements, certain ''bailliages'' were given extended powers by Henri II of France: these were called '''''présidiaux'''''.  ''Bailliages'' and ''présidiaux'' were also the first court for certain crimes (these cases had formerly been under the supervision of the local seigneurs): sacrilege, lèse-majesté, kidnapping, rape, heresy, alteration of money, sedition, insurrections, and the illegal carrying of arms.

By the late 16th century, the role of the "bailli" had become merely honorary, and judicial power was invested solely in the lieutenant général of the ''bailliage''.  The administrative and financial role of the ''bailliages'' and ''sénéchaussées'' declined in the early modern period (superseded by the king's royal tax collectors and regional gouverneurs, and later by the intendants), and by the end of the 18th century, the ''bailliages'', which numbered into the hundreds, served only a judicial function.

In French, a court bailiff is called a "huissier de justice".

==Modern bailiffs==
===Belgium===
Most of the functions associated with the older Dutch-language terms translated as 'bailiff' in English, are no longer found in one officer. The modern terms 'huissier de justice' (in French) or 'gerechtsdeurwaarder' (in Dutch) however, are usually translated into English as 'bailiff'. This is a sworn officer who may legally deliver exploits (process serving), see to the execution of court orders such as the confiscation of goods, or be an official legal witness. A similar officer is typical in many countries with a non-Anglo Saxon law system that is based on the Napoleonic Code. In Belgium, the bailiff can be appointed by a confiscating court to exercise the judicial mandate of 'schuldbemiddelaar' (in Dutch) or 'médiateur de dettes' (in French), a debt negotiator, in a procedure called 'collectieve schuldenregeling' (CSR) or 'médiation collective de dettes', a collectively negotiated settlement of debts, which is comparable with the regulations by the 'Wet Schuldsanering Natuurlijke Personen' (WSNP) in the Netherlands.

The official judicial tasks are often supplemented by tasks as independent canton'' level), etc.

===British Isles===
====England & Wales====

In England & Wales, the bailiff of a franchise or liberty is the officer who executes writs and processes, and impanels juries within the franchise. He is appointed by the lord of such franchise (who, in the Sheriffs Act 1887, § 34, is referred to as the bailiff of the franchise).

The bailiff of a sheriff is an under-officer employed by a sheriff within a county for the purpose of executing writs, processes, distraints and arrests. As a sheriff is liable for the acts of his officers acting under his warrant, his bailiffs are annually bound to him in an obligation with sureties for the faithful discharge of their office, and thence are called bound bailiffs. They are also often called 'bum-bailiffs', or, shortly, 'bums'. The origin of this word is uncertain; the New English Dictionary suggests that it is in allusion to the mode of catching the offender. Special bailiffs are officers appointed by the sheriff at the request of a plaintiff for the purpose of executing a particular process. The appointment of a special bailiff relieves the sheriff from all responsibility until the party is arrested and delivered into the sheriff's actual custody.

By the high bailiffs, appointed by the judge and removable by the Lord Chancellor; and every person discharging the duties of high bailiff is empowered to appoint a sufficient number of able and fit persons as bailiffs to assist him, whom he can dismiss at his pleasure. The duty of the high bailiff is to serve all summonses and orders, and execute all the warrants, precepts and writs issued out of the court. The high bailiff is responsible for all the acts and defaults of himself, and of the bailiffs appointed to assist him, in the same way as a sheriff of a county is responsible for the acts and defaults of himself and his officers. By the same act (§49) bailiffs are answerable for any connivance, omission or neglect to levy any such execution. No action can be brought against a bailiff acting under order of the court without six days' notice (§52). Any warrant to a bailiff to give possession of a tenement justifies him in entering upon the premises named in the warrant, and giving possession, provided the entry be made between the hours of 6&nbsp;a.m. and 10&nbsp;p.m. (§ 142). The Law of Distress Amendment Act 1888 enacts that no person may act as a bailiff to levy any distress for rent, unless he is authorized by a County Court judge to act as a bailiff.

Bailiffs will be replaced by enforcement agents when the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, s.63 comes into force.

<Most of the above is historically accurate but quite not up to date.

Civil Court Enforcement in England & Wales is divided between the High Court and the County Court. Sheriffs became High Court Enforcement Officers by act of parliament in 2005. They enforce High Court Writs which is for any debt over £600. County court order for debts above the limit can be transferred up for enforcement. 

A High Court Enforcement Officer must undergo a specified course in law and procedure to obtain their appointment.Many are lawyers who oversee unqualified staff.

The individual that most people refer to as a Bailiff is the County Court Bailiff.There are two types both of which must be certified as a bailiff under the Distress for rent Rules 1988: The first is an officer of the court employed directly by the court and they deal with domestic property repossession and general county court warrants.

Then there are Private Bailiffs who enforce county court orders for Local authorities such as unpaid parking fines and Congestion Charges. All under the Traffic Management Act 2004. Previously the Road Traffic Act 1991. Their charges are set down by statute., They also enforce council Tax both domestic and commercial and Child Support Agency (CSA) liability Orders.

In addition they deal with repossession of commercial buildings under distress for rent.

There are also Civilian Enforcement Officers (CEO's)appointed under the Magistrate Courts Act 1980 who enforce Magistrate Court warrants of arrest and Execution by way of distress for unpaid fines, etc. They have a power of entry and to use force. CEO's do not have to be Certificated Bailiffs. They are not subject to the jurisdiction of the County Court.Their fees are prescribed by Her Majesties Court Service.
