The '''1997 Pacific typhoon season''' has no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1997, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November. <ref>Gary Padgett. [http://www.typhoon2000.ph/garyp_mgtcs/may03sum.txt May 2003 Tropical Cyclone Summary.] Retrieved on 2006-08-26.</ref> These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. 

The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form east of the Date Line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1997 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical Storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Tropical depressions in this basin have the "W" suffix added to their number. Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. This can often result in the same storm having two names.

==Storms==
The season was unusual in the number of super typhoons that occurred in the basin, with eleven typhoons reaching winds of at least 135&nbsp;knots. They were Isa, Nestor, Rosie, Winnie, Bing, Oliwa (from Central Pacific), Ginger, Ivan, Joan, Keith, and Paka (from Central Pacific). This was due to the strong El Niño of 1997-1998, which contributed to the record amounts of not only super typhoons but also tropical storms in the Western and Eastern Pacific. Fortunately, most of the stronger systems remained at sea.

===Tropical Storm Hannah (Atring)===

In early January, an area of convection developed along a near-trough just west of the cyclonic bands, and early on Philippine island of Mindanao.<ref name="hannahatcr"></ref> 

Near the end of its duration, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration began issuing warnings on Hannah when was a tropical depression; the institution named the storm Tropical Depression Atring.<ref name="wmo905"></ref> The storm was never tracked by the Japan Meteorological Agency.<ref name="jma"/> There were no reports of significant damage or injuries.<ref name="hannahatcr"/>

===Super Typhoon Isa===

Isa developed from a disturbance in the monsoon trough near the Caroline Islands on April 12. It moved erratically at first, though after attaining tropical storm status it curved westward due to the subtropical ridge to its north. Isa very gradually intensified, and on April 20 the typhoon reached peak 1-min winds of 270&nbsp;km/h (165&nbsp;mph), as reported by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center; Japan Meteorological Agency reported maximum 10-min winds of 155&nbsp;km/h (100&nbsp;mph). After turning northward, it accelerated to the northeast, and merged with a larger extratropical cyclone on April 24.<ref name="isatcr"></ref><ref name="jma"/>

Early in its duration, Isa caused light rainfall and moderate winds on Pohnpei. Later, a stationary rainband from the typhoon dropped heavy precipitation on Guam during its dry season. Damage in the Guam National Weather Service area of responsibility totaled $1&nbsp;million (1997&nbsp;USD, $1.3&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD), the majority of it from crop damage. No deaths were reported.<ref name="isacdc"></ref>

===Tropical Storm Jimmy===

}}
A low-level equatorial westerly wind system developed an area of convection on April 18, the same system that previously developed Typhoon Isa. It drifted west-northwestward, and on April 21 separated from the westerly wind system. At 0400 UTC on April 22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system, and two hours later the JTWC issued the first warning on Tropical Storm Jimmy about 1360&nbsp;km (845 mi) southeast of Guam.<ref name="jimmyatcr"></ref> Coinciding with its first warning, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified it as a tropical depression.<ref name="jma"></ref> 

Jimmy continued northwestward through a break in the subtropical ridge caused by Isa, and it steadily intensified as it tracked through an area of light vertical frontal trough over the open Pacific Ocean. The storm had little effects on land.<ref name="jimmyatcr"/>

===Tropical Storm Kelly===

A low-level TCFA  and the system was declared Tropical Depression 04W shortly after. The depression slowly intensified and was upgraded to a Tropical Storm early on May 8 and was named Kelly. Kelly was able to intensify slightly before strong vertical wind shear displaced the center, weakening Kelly. Kelly was downgraded to a Tropical Depression on May 10 and the remnant circulation dissipated the next day. <ref>http://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/atcr/1997atcr/pdf/wnp/04w.pdf</ref>

Tropical Depression 5W drifted eastward through the Philippines in late May. The heavy rain it brought caused mudslides that killed 33 people. The depression continued northeastward, becoming a tropical storm, and transitioning to an extratropical storm on May 30.<ref>Joint Typhoon Warning Center.

On July 18, Tropical Depression 10W formed near Caroline Islands. 10W was upgraded to Tropical Storm Rosie and became a Category&nbsp;5 Super Typhoon on July 22. Rosie moved northward and began to weaken. Rosie made a landfall as a Category&nbsp;1 typhoon at Shikoku, Japan on July 26. Two people were killed because of Rosie.<ref>Joint Typhoon Warning Center.

In the middle of July, a mid-level circulation formed within the outflow from Typhoon Rosie; after drifting northwestward for 2&nbsp;days the system turned to the northeast, and by July 24 the influence from Rosie greatly diminished. Accordingly, the organization of the depression quickly increased, and on July 24 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as Tropical Depression 11W.<ref name="scottatcr"/>

On August 5, a tropical depression formed near the Marshall Islands. It headed northwestward, slowly strengthening to a tropical storm on the 9th. Intensification became more rapid as conditions became more favorable, and Winnie reached typhoon strength on the 10th. 2&nbsp;days later, it became the 4th Super Typhoon of the season with peak winds of 160&nbsp;mph. Soon after, the eye became ragged and large, with an outer eyewall reaching 200&nbsp;miles in diameter. On the 18th, a minimal Typhoon Winnie passed north of Taiwan and hit eastern China, where it winded down until dissipating on the 19th. The remnant continued northeastward, bringing heavy rain and damage across China until the 23rd. Winnie caused 64 deaths, 39 of which were in Taiwan from the heavy rain.<ref>Joint Typhoon Warning Center.

Typhoon Amber was the eighteenth tropical cyclone of the season.

'''1997年太平洋颱風季'''泛指在1997年全年內的任何時間，於赤道以北及國際換日線以西的太平洋水域所產生的熱帶氣旋。雖然有關方面並沒有設下本颱風季的指定期限，但大部份於西北太平洋的熱帶氣旋通常都會於六月至十二月期間形成。

本條目的範圍僅侷限於赤道以北及國際換日線以西的太平洋水域。於赤道以北及國際換日線以東的太平洋水域產生的風暴則被稱為颶風。在西太平洋產生的熱帶低氣壓是由美國聯合颱風警報中心命名，而在該地區的熱帶低氣壓的編號都以 W 字母作結。而凡進入或產生於菲律賓風暴責任範圍以內的熱帶低氣壓，菲律賓大氣地理天文部門（PAGASA）都會為它們訂立一個菲律賓名稱，作當地警報用途；因此同一個風暴有時候會有兩個不同的名稱。

以下各颱風資訊以颱風存在期間的最強形態為名稱，如維克托會被名為颱風維克托，而非熱帶風暴維克托或強烈熱帶風暴維克托等等作為名稱。
