'''瑪爾庫斯·維普撒尼烏斯·阿格里帕'''（'''Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa'''，前63年 - 前12年），古羅馬政治家與軍人，屋大維（未來的凱撒·奧古斯都）的密友、女婿與大臣。屋大維大多數軍事上的勝利都要歸功於他。其中最著名的是對马克·安东尼與克麗歐佩特拉七世的亚克兴海战（Battle of Actium）。

==早年==

阿格里帕身世平凡，出生在羅馬的郊外。他與屋大維同年生，自小就是親密的玩伴。他倆在该尤斯·尤利乌斯·恺撒手下的騎兵軍官。役後回到羅馬，恺撒宣布屋大維為他的法定繼承人。因爲元老院的派系鬥爭愈演愈烈，恺撒把他們送到 Apollonia 的馬其頓軍團見習。一同去的還有凱撒另一個朋友的兒子 Gaius Maecenas。

由於恺撒的促成，三人在外省結下了深厚的友誼。阿格里帕很快受到了馬其頓軍團的歡迎，軍官們對他驚人的領導才能印象深刻。他還學習了建築學，日後對他的事業大有幫助的技能。凱撒在前44年被刺死的消息傳到 Apollonia 後，由於他和 Maecenas 的建議，屋大維即刻啓程返回羅馬。

==崛起==

囬到羅馬後，三人意識到他們需要軍團的支持。阿格里帕返回希臘掌握馬其頓軍團（最重要的是馬其頓第四軍團）再進軍羅馬。得到自己的軍隊後，屋大維與馬克·安東尼及李必达結成后三头同盟共同對付謀殺凱撒者。Phillipi 之役阿格里帕是屋大維與安東尼最倚重的將領。

凱旋後，屋大維又遣阿格里帕與 Lucius Antonius 及 Fulvia Antonia（馬克·安東尼之弟及妻）作戰（41BC）。40BC，拔 Perusia，告捷。兩年後，他又鎮壓了高卢的 Aquitanian 人的叛亂，並渡過莱茵河平息日耳曼部落的騷擾。班師回京，他谢绝了凱旋礼(triumphum,又稱閲兵式)，不过接受了他的第一个执政官职：前37年执政官。

此时塞克斯图斯·龐倍乌斯(Sextus Pompeius)已控制了意大利沿岸的海域。阿格里帕開鑿了一條運河把 Lucrinus 湖和海洋連成一體，形成一個外港，又把阿佛纳斯湖（Avernus）和 Lucrinus 湖連成一體，形成一個内港，於是為自己的艦隊提供了安全的庇護所。在這段時間，阿格里帕與 Pomponia 成婚（西塞罗朋友 Titus Pomponius Atticus 的女兒）。

屋大維試圖自己指揮奪取塞克斯图斯控制的西西里，但在前37年的 Messina 海戰失敗，前36年的8月又敗。阿格里帕被遣與塞克斯图斯·龐倍乌斯(Sextus Pompeius) 作戰。直至水師練成，阿格里帕方始出戰。在前36年他獲得 Mylae 與 Naucholus 兩場大捷，一月之内擊潰了塞克斯图斯·龐倍乌斯的水師。由此，阿格里帕躋身羅馬海軍名將之列。

'''Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa''' (''c.'' 63 BC&ndash;12 BC) was a Roman statesman and general.<ref name="DGRBM"></ref>  He was a close friend, son-in-law, lieutenant and minister to Octavian, the future emperor Caesar Augustus. He was responsible for most of Octavian’s military triumphs, most notably winning the naval Battle of Actium against the forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII of Egypt.

==Early life==
Agrippa was born in 64&ndash;62 BC<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#28.3 54.28.3] places Agrippa's death in late March of 12 BC, while Syria includes a month named after Agrippa beginning on Velleius Paterculus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#96 2.96], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#127 127].</ref> However, Agrippa was about the same age as Octavius (the future emperor Augustus), and the two were educated together and became close friends. Despite Agrippa's association with the family of civil wars of the 40s BC, fighting under Cato against Caesar in Africa. When Cato's forces were defeated, Agrippa's brother was taken prisoner but freed after Octavius interceded on his behalf.<ref>Nicolaus of Damascus, ''[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/nicolaus.html Life of Augustus]'' 7.</ref>

It is not known whether Agrippa fought against his brother in Africa, but he probably served in Caesar's campaign of 46&ndash;45 BC against Apollonia with the Macedonian legions, while Caesar consolidated his power in Rome.<ref>Life of Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#94.12 94.12].</ref> It was in the fourth month of their stay in Apollonia that the news of Julius Caesar's Quintus Salvidienus Rufus, that he march on Rome with the troops from Macedonia, Octavius decided to sail to Italy with a small retinue. After his arrival, he learnt that Caesar had adopted him as his legal heir.<ref>Nicolaus of Damascus, ''[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/nicolaus.html Life of Augustus]'' 16&ndash;17; Velleius Paterculus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2C*.html#59.5 2.59.5].</ref> (Octavius now took over Caesar's name, but is referred to by modern historians as "Octavian" during this period.)

==Rise in power==
After Octavian's return to Rome, he and his supporters realized they needed the support of legions. Agrippa helped Octavian to levy troops in Lepidus, legally established in 43 BC as the Life of Brutus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Brutus*.html#27.4 27.4].</ref> It may have been in the same year that Agrippa began his political career, holding the position of Senate.<ref>Mentioned only by Servius ''auctus'' on Virgil, ''Aeneid'' [http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Serv.+A.+8.682 8.682], but a necessary preliminary to his position as urban praetor in 40 BC. Roddaz (p. 41) favours the 43 BC date.</ref>

In 42 BC, Agrippa probably fought alongside Octavian and Antony in the Lucius Antonius and Gaul, leaving Agrippa as Sicily. In July 40, while Agrippa was occupied with the Ludi Apollinares that were the praetor's responsibility, Sextus began a raid in southern Italy. Agrippa advanced on him, forcing him to withdraw.<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/48*.html#20 48.20]; Reinhold, p. 22.</ref> However, the Triumvirate proved unstable, and in August 40 Antony sided with Sextus in a joint invasion of Italy. Agrippa's success in retaking Sipontum from Antony helped bring an end to the conflict.<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/48*.html#28 48.28]; Reinhold, p. 23.</ref> Agrippa was among the intermediaries through whom Antony and Octavian agreed once more upon peace. During the discussions Octavian learned that Salvidienus had offered to betray him to Antony, with the result that Salvidienus was executed or committed suicide. Agrippa was now Octavian's leading general.<ref>Reinhold, pp. 23&ndash;24.</ref>

In 39 or 38 BC, Octavian appointed Agrippa governor of consulship for triumph for his exploits in Gaul &ndash; on the grounds, says Dio, that he thought it improper to celebrate during a time of trouble for Octavian.<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/48*.html#49 48.49]; Reinhold, pp. 25&ndash;29. Agrippa's youth is noted by Lendering, "[http://www.livius.org/vi-vr/vipsanius/agrippa.html#Philippi From Philippi to Actium]".</ref> Since Sextus Pompeius had command of the sea on the coasts of Italy, Agrippa's first care was to provide a safe harbor for his ships. He accomplished this by cutting through the strips of land which separated the Lacus Lucrinus from the sea, thus forming an outer harbor, while joining the lake Avernus to the Lucrinus to serve as an inner harbor.<ref>Reinhold, pp. 29&ndash;32.</ref> The new harbor-complex was named Caecilia Pomponia Attica, daughter of Cicero's friend Titus Pomponius Atticus.<ref>Reinhold, pp. 35&ndash;37.</ref>

In 36 BC Octavian and Agrippa set sail against Sextus. The fleet was badly damaged by storms and had to withdraw; Agrippa was left in charge of the second attempt. Thanks to superior technology and training, Agrippa and his men won decisive victories at Naulochus, destroying all but seventeen of Sextus' ships and compelling most of his forces to surrender. Octavian, with his power increased, forced the triumvir Lepidus into retirement and entered Rome in triumph.<ref>Reinhold, pp. 37&ndash;42.</ref> Agrippa received the unprecedented honor of a naval crown decorated with the beaks of ships; as Dio remarks, this was "a decoration given to nobody before or since".<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/49*.html#14.3 49.14.3].</ref>

==Life in public service==
thumb|left|[[Hadrian's Pantheon was built to Agrippa's design. It bears the legend <small>M·AGRIPPA·L·F·COS·TERTIVM·FECIT</small>, which means ''Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, built during his third consulate'']]

Agrippa participated in smaller military campaigns in 35 and 34 BC, but by the autumn of 34 he had returned to Rome.<ref>Reinhold, pp. 45&ndash;47.</ref> He rapidly set out on a campaign of public repairs and improvements, including renovation of the aqueduct known as the Aqua Marcia and an extension of its pipes to cover more of the city. Through his actions after being elected in 33 BC as one of the aediles (officials responsible for Rome's buildings and festivals), the streets were repaired and the sewers were cleaned out, while lavish public spectacles were put on.<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/49*.html#42 49.42&ndash;43].</ref> Agrippa signalized his tenure of office by effecting great improvements in the city of Rome, restoring and building aqueducts, enlarging and cleansing the Cloaca Maxima, constructing baths and porticos, and laying out gardens. He also gave a stimulus to the public exhibition of works of art. It was unusual for an ex-consul to hold the lower-ranking position of aedile,<ref>Lendering, "[http://www.livius.org/vi-vr/vipsanius/agrippa.html#Philippi From Philippi to Actium]".</ref> but Agrippa's success bore out this break with tradition. As emperor, Augustus would later boast that "he had found the city of brick but left it of marble", thanks in part to the great services provided by Agrippa under his reign.

Agrippa's father-in-law Atticus, suffering from a serious illness, committed suicide in 32 BC. According to Atticus' friend and biographer Cornelius Nepos, this decision was a cause of serious grief to Agrippa.<ref>Cornelius Nepos, ''[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nepos.htm#Atticus Life of Atticus]'' 21&ndash;22.</ref>
==Antony and Cleopatra==
Agrippa was again called away to take command of the fleet when the war with Antony and Cleopatra broke out. He captured the strategically important city of Methone at the southwest of the Peloponnese, then sailed north, raiding the Greek coast and capturing Corcyra (modern Corfu). Octavian then brought his forces to Corcyra, occupying it as a naval base.<ref>Orosius, ''History Against the Pagans'' [http://www.attalus.org/latin/orosius6B.html#19 6.19.6&ndash;7]; Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/50*.html#11 50.11.1&ndash;12.3]; Reinhold, pp. 53&ndash;54.</ref> Antony drew up his ships and troops at Actium, where Octavian moved to meet him. Agrippa meanwhile defeated Antony's supporter Quintus Nasidius in a naval battle at Patrae.<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/50*.html#13.5 50.13.5].</ref> Dio relates that as Agrippa moved to join Octavian near Actium, he encountered Gaius Sosius, one of Antony's lieutenants, who was making a surprise attack on the squadron of Lucius Tarius, a supporter of Octavian. Agrippa's unexpected arrival turned the battle around.<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/50*.html#14 50.14.1&ndash;2]; cf. Velleius Paterculus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2C*.html#84.2 2.84.2] ("Agrippa ... before the final conflict had twice defeated the fleet of the enemy"). Dio is wrong to say that Sosius was killed, since he in fact fought at and survived the Battle of Actium (Reinhold, p. 54 n. 14; Roddaz, p. 163 n. 140).</ref>

As the decisive battle approached, according to Dio, Octavian received intelligence that Antony and Cleopatra planned to break past his naval blockade and escape. At first he wished to allow the flagships past, arguing that he could overtake them with his lighter vessels and that the other opposing ships would surrender when they saw their leaders' cowardice. Agrippa objected that Antony's ships, although larger, could outrun Octavian's if they hoisted sails, and that Octavian ought to fight now because Antony's fleet had just been struck by storms. Octavian followed his friend's advice.<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/50*.html#31 50.31.1&ndash;3].</ref>

On September 2 31 BC, the Battle of Actium was fought. Octavian's victory, which gave him the mastery of Rome and the empire, was mainly due to Agrippa.<ref>Reinhold, pp. 57&ndash;58; Roddaz, pp. 178&ndash;181.</ref> As a token of signal regard, Octavian bestowed upon him the hand of his niece Claudia Marcella Major in 28 BC. He also served a second consulship with Octavian the same year. In 27 BC, Agrippa held a third consulship with Octavian, and in that year, the senate also bestowed upon Octavian the imperial title of Augustus.

In commemoration of the Battle of Actium, Agrippa built and dedicated the building that served as the Roman Pantheon before its destruction in 80. Emperor Hadrian used Agrippa's design to build his own Pantheon, which survives in Rome. The inscription of the later building, which was built around 125, preserves the text of the inscription from Agrippa's building during his third consulship. The years following his third consulship, Agrippa spent in Gaul, reforming the provincial administration and taxation system, along with building an effective road system and aqueducts.

==Late life==

His friendship with Augustus seems to have been clouded by the jealousy of his brother-in-law Marcellus, which was probably fomented by the intrigues of legate to Syria, while he himself remained at Lesbos and governed by proxy, though he may have been on a secret mission to negotiate with the Parthians about the return of the Roman legions standards which they held.<ref>David Magie, ''The Mission of Agrippa to the Orient in 23 BC'', Classical Philology, Vol. 3, No. 2(Apr., 1908), pp. 145-152</ref> On the death of Marcellus, which took place within a year of his exile, he was recalled to Rome by Augustus, who found he could not dispense with his services. However, if one places the events in the context of the crisis in 23 BC it seems unlikely that, when facing significant opposition and about to make a major political climb down, the emperor Augustus would place a man in exile in charge of the largest body of Roman troops. What is far more likely is that Agrippa's 'exile' was actually the careful political positioning of a loyal lieutenant in command of a significant army as a back up plan in case the settlement plans of 23 BC failed and Augustus needed military support. 

It is said that Maecenas advised Augustus to attach Agrippa still more closely to him by making him his son-in-law. He accordingly induced him to divorce Marcella and marry his daughter Jewish population. Agrippa also restored effective Roman control over the Cimmerian Chersonnese (modern-day Crimea) during his governorship. 

Agrippa’s last public service was his beginning of the conquest of the upper Danube River region, which would become the Roman province of Pannonia in 13 BC. He died at Campania in March of 12 BC at the age of 51. His posthumous son, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa Postumus, was named in his honor. Augustus honored his memory by a magnificent funeral and spent over a month in mourning. Augustus personally oversaw all of Agrippa's children’s educations.

==Legacy==

Agrippa was also known as a writer, especially on the subject of survey of the empire made was carried out. He constructed a circular chart, which was later engraved on marble by Augustus, and afterwards placed in the colonnade built by his sister Polla. Amongst his writings, an autobiography, now lost, is referred to.

Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, along with Gaius Maecenas and Octavian, was a central person in the establishing of the Principate system of emperors, which would govern the Roman Empire up until the Crisis of the Third Century and the birth of Dominate system.  His grandson Gaius is known to history as the Emperor Caligula, and his great-grandson Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus would rule as the Emperor Nero.
