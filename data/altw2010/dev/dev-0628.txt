Индией и Китаем, но географическое положение Тибета таково, что он практически изолирован от них. Нет данных о том, что китайским и бирманским можно строить гипотезы о совместном происхождении этих народов. Тем не менее все исторические свидетельства начинаются с времён, когда тибетская культура уже существовала независимо от соседей.

== Предыстория ==

Неизвестно, откуда произошли тибетцы — из центральной или из восточной Азии, но бирманскому и другим тибето-бирманским языкам, откуда можно предполагать общее происхождение. С момента появления исторических свидетельств о Тибете тибетский язык уже сформировался.

На плато Чан Тан были найдены доисторические укрепления на холмах железного века и погребения, но пока нет убедительного объяснения их происхождения. Согласно тибетским текстам, изначально тут располагалась культура бон.

== История Тибета ==

В конце VI-го и начале VII-го века поднявшееся Ярлунгское племя (в нынешнем округе танским двором были заключены царственные браки, благодаря им, а также благодаря неофициальным обменам между населением Китая и Тибета политические, хозяйственные и культурные связи внутреннего Китая с Тибетом получили дальнейшее развитие. Во второй половине IX-го века царство Туфань пришло в упадок. В тибетской истории предшествовавший этому период называется периодом правления «гамбо», а последующие 300 лет - периодом раскола. В период раскола в силу вошли местные родовые правители, враждовавшие друг с другом. Во внутреннем Китае это время также было смутным (Эпоха пяти Династий и Десяти царств и последующие династии Сун, Ляо), когда в стране то и дело менялась власть и шли нескончаемые войны.
В середине XIII-го века Тибет официально вошел в состав Китайской империи. Центральное правительство Китая (Династия Юань) объявило Тибет районом, непосредственно ему подчинявшимся. В период династии Мин был установлен порядок назначения высших тибетских религиозных вождей и районной администрации. 

== Согласно мифологии ==

Первый царь Тибета Ньяти-цзанпо (Gnya'-khri-btsan-po) спустился с неба или прибыл из Индии и почитался как божество. Он всё время поддерживал контакт с небом с помощью верёвки и не умер, а вернулся по верёвке на небо.

Легендарный царь Дигум-цзанпо (Dri-gum-brtsan-po) спровоцировал своего конюха на драку, во время которой его небесный шнурок оборвался, и он был убит. Дигум-цзанпо и все последующие цари умирали как обычные люди и их кремировали.

== Тибетская империя ==

См. Тибетские цари

Более детально тибетская история известна c Бенгалии на юге до Монголии на севере. Тибетцы противостояли в большей степени Китаю чем Индии по причине труднопроходимости Гималаев, Китай тибетцы называли ''Rgya-nag'' (Чёрная Империя), а Индию — ''Rgya-gar'' (Белая Империя).

=== Первое упоминание в истории ===
Первое упоминание Тибета в истории можно встретить в «Географии» Клавдия Птоломея под названием βαται, в Греческой траскрипции названы как Bod. Следующее упоминание Тибета встречается в Китайских текстах, как Fa. Первая запись в истории Тибета, получившая подтверждение и из других источников о царе Намри-Сронцзан (Gnam-ri-slong-rtsan), пославшем посла в Китай в начале седьмого столетия (Beckwith, C. Uni. of Indiana Diss. 1977).

=== Основание династии ===

=== Правление Сонгцена Гампо (617—650) ===

frame| Царь Сонгтсен Гампо (пещера в Йерпа)

Царь Сонгцен Гампо известен тем, что принёс в Тибет буддизм. Про него сложено много противоречивых и фантастических легенд, отчего восстановить исторически ход событий непросто.

Сонгцен Гампо потребовал от китайцев дать ему в жёны принцессу, но получил отказ. Тогда он провёл удачную военную операцию против китайцев в районе озера Кукунор к северо-востоку от Тибета, и император в конце концов дал согласие на брак. После брака в 640 установился долгосрочный мир между Тибетом и Китаем.

После смерти Сонгцена Гампо формально власть перешла к его внуку, но реально страной стал править министр, а буддизм пришёл в упадок.

=== Правление Трисонг Децена 755—797 ===

Царь Шактаракшиту и Падмасамбхаву, которые организовали перевод с санскрита текстов Учения и создали буддийскую сангху Тибета. В Центральном Тибете был построен монастырский университет Самье, который до сих пор является одним из важнейших центров буддизма.

Во время правления Трисонга Децена произошла знаменитая двухлетняя дискуссия в монастыре Камалашилой, учителем тантрического буддизма. Царь Трисонг Децен принял сторону Камалашилы, и с тех пор на Тибете прочно установился тантрический буддизм. (см. также Дискуссия в Самье)

В начале правления империя была в упадке, отпали или бунтовали окраины, с запада подступали арабы. В Чанъаня. Китайский император был вынужден бежать. В Китаем и Тибетом, по которому за Тибетом закрепились земли в районе Кукунора.

Трисонг Децен заключил союз с царём Наньчжао Имобсуном, и в 778 предпринял атаку на китайскую территорию в провинции Сычуань.

Трисонг Децен предпринял также походы на запад, достигнув реки Оксус, и столкнулся с арабским халифом Гарун аль-Рашидом. Халиф смог договориться с китайским императором об альянсе против Тибета, в результате чего экспансия Трисонг Децена была остановлена. В последующие годы своего правления Трисонг Децен был занят войной на два фронта — с арабами на западе и с китайцами на севере и на востоке, вплоть до 797.

=== Правление Ралпачана 815—838 ===
Ралпачан, внук царя Трисонг Децена, известен своим исключительным благочестием.

Он пригласил мастеров, скульптуров, художников из Индии, Китая, Кашмира для выполнения задуманного им плана строительства буддийских храмов и монастырей. Он ввёл в органы управления страной монахов, дав им права решающего голоса наравне с главными министрами, приравняв статус монаха к статусу высшего чиновничества.

Во время его правления государство активно поддерживало переводы буддийских сочинений с санскрита на тибетский язык.

В Китаем, подтверждающий право тибетцев на занятую территорию.

Во время правления Ралпачана империя ослабевала, правительство погрузилось в запутанные интриги, активность проявили сторонники религии Бон.

'''Tibetan history''' is characterized by a special dedication to the Buddhist religion, both in the eyes of its own people as well as for the Mongol and Manchu peoples. 

==Tibet==

Tibet is situated between the two ancient civilizations of China and India, but the tangled mountain ranges of the Tibetan Plateau and the towering Himalayas serve to distance it from both. The Tibetan language is a member of the Tibeto-Burman branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Tibet is nicknamed "the roof of the world" or "the land of snows". 

==Prehistory==
The earliest Tibetan historical texts identify the Zhang Zhung culture as a people who migrated from the Amdo region into what is now the region of Guge in western Tibet.<ref name="Norbu"></ref> The Zhang Zhung are considered the original culture of the Bön religion.<ref name="Hoffman"> </ref> By the first century BCE, a neighboring kingdom arose in the Yarlung valley, and the Yarlung king, Drigum Tsenpo, attempted to remove the influence of the Zhang Zhung by expelling the Zhang's Bon priests from Yarlung.<ref name="Karmay"></ref> He was assassinated and Zhang Zhung continued its dominance of the region until it was annexed by Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century. 

Construction of an early history of the Tibetan region by western sources relies primarily on ancient Chinese histories supplemented with limited archaeological findings.<ref name="Hoffman" /> Chinese and "proto-Tibeto-Burman"  languages may have split sometime before 4000 BC. The Chinese began growing millet in the Yellow River valley and the Tibeto-Burmans remained nomads; Tibetan split from Burmese circa 500<ref name="VanDriem"> </ref>. 

===Archaeological record===
Megalithic monuments dot the Tibetan Plateau and may have been used in ancestor worship. It is unknown whether these monuments were built by ancient Tibetans.<ref name="Hoffman" /> Prehistoric Iron Age hill forts and burial complexes have recently been found on the Tibetan plateau but the remote high altitude location makes archaeological research difficult. 

In his book, ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', Thomas Laird says, "The Indian archaeologist V. N. Misra has shown that early humans inhabited the Tibetan Plateau from at least twenty thousand years ago and that there is reason to believe that early humans passed through Tibet at the time India was first inhabited, half a million years ago.<ref name=autogenerated10>Laird, Thomas. (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', pp. 114-117.Grove Press, New York. ISBN 978-0-8021-1827-1.</ref>

===Mythological origins===
The dates attributed to the first Tibetan king, Nyatri Tsanpo (), vary. Some Tibetan texts give 126 BCE, others 414 BCE.<ref name=autogenerated5></ref> In a sarcastic account that mocks the king, he is said to have descended from a one-footed creature called the Theurang, having webbed fingers and a tongue so large it could cover his face. Due to his terrifying appearance he was feared in his native Puwo and exiled by the Bon to Tibet. There he was greeted as a fearsome being, and he became king.<ref name="Norbu"> 

The Tibetan kings were said to remain connected to the heavens via a ''dmu'' cord (''dmu thag'') so that rather than dying, they ascended directly to heaven. Then king Drigum Tsenpo (''Dri-gum-brtsan-po'') provoked his groom ''Longam'' (''Lo-ngam'') into a dual. During the fight the king's ''dmu'' cord was cut, and he was killed. Thereafter Drigum Tsenpo and subsequent kings left corpses and the Bon conducted funerary rites.<ref>Haarh, ''The Yarluṅ Dynasty''. Copenhagen: 1969.</ref><ref>Beckwith, Christopher I.

In a later myth, first attested in the ''Maṇi bka' 'bum'', the Tibetan people are the progeny of the union of a monkey and rock Avalokiteśvara (Tib. ''Spyan-ras-gzigs'') and the ogress in fact the goddess Tara (Tib. ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>Grol-ma'').<ref>Khar, Rabgong Dorjee (1991). "A Brief Discussion on Tibetan History Prior to Nyatri Tsenpo."

(This article originally appeared in the Tibetan quarterly ''Bod-ljongs zhib-'jug'' (No. 1, 1986).</ref>

==Early History==

Although originally the term was 'Bod', from the 7th century CE the Chinese rendered Bod as 蕃 - pinyin: ''fan'' or ''bo'' (pronounced at that time something like p'i̭̭wǎn).<ref>''Grand dictionnaire Ricci de la langue chinoise''. 7 volumes. Instituts Ricci (Paris – Taipei). Desclée de Brouwer. 2001. Vol. II, p. 543.</ref>. R.A. Stein discusses the point:

<blockquote>Was this because Tibetans sometimes said 'Bon' instead of 'Bod', or because 'fan' in Chinese was a common name for 'barbarians'? We do not know. But before long, on the testimony of a Tibetan ambassador, the Chinese started using the form T'u-fan [吐蕃 - also transliterated in pinyin as Tubo], by assimilation with the name of the T'u-fa, a Turco-Mongol race, who must originally have been called something like Tuppat. At the same period, Turkish and Sogdian texts mention a people called 'Tüpüt', situated roughly in the north-east of modern Tibet. This is the form that Moslem writers have used since the ninth century (Tübbet, Tibbat, etc.). Through them it reached the medieval European explorers (Piano-Carpini, Rubruck, Marco Polo, Francesco della Penna)."<ref>Stein, R. A. ''Tibetan Civilization''. (1972), p. 32. Stanford University Press. ISBN 0-8047-0806-1 (cloth); ISBN 0-8047-0901-7.(paper)</ref></blockquote>

The first externally confirmed contact with the Tibetan kingdom in recorded Tibetan history occurred when King Namri Löntsän (''Gnam-ri-slon-rtsan'') sent an ambassador to China in the early 7th century.<ref name="Beckwith1977">Beckwith, ''C. Uni. of Indiana Diss.'', 1977</ref>

===Founding of the dynasty===
Tibet began at the castle named Taktsé (''Stag-rtse'') in the Chingba (''Phying-ba'') district of Chonggyä (''Phyongs-rgyas''). There, According to the ''Old Tibetan Chronicle''

<blockquote>
"A group of conspirators convinced Stag-bu snya-gzigs [Tagbu Nyazig] to rebel against Dgu-gri Zing-po-rje [Gudri Zingpoje]. Zing-po-rje was in turn a vassal of the Zhang-zhung empire under the Lig myi dynasty. Zing-po-rje died before the conspiracy could get underway, and his son Gnam-ri-slon-mtshan [Namri Löntsen] instead led the conspiracy after extracting an oath of fealty from the conspirators."<ref name="Beckwith1987">Beckwith, Christopher I.

ISBN 0-691-02469-3, p. 14, 48, 50.</ref>
</blockquote>

The group prevailed against Zing-po-rje. At this point Namri Songtsen (Namri Löntsän) was the leader of a fledgling clan which prevailed over all his neighboring clans, one by one, to finally control all the area around what is now Lhasa by 630, when he was assassinated. This new-born regional state would become the Tibetan Empire. The government of Namri Songtsen sent two embassies to China in 608 and 609, marking the appearance of Tibet on the international scene.<ref>Beckwith, Christopher I.

==Tibetan Empire==
thumb|right|250px|Map of Tibetan Empire in 820 in relation to other significant powers 
As has been noted, traditional Tibetan history preserves a lengthy list of rulers, whose exploits become subject to external verification by the seventh century.  From the 7th to the 11th century a series of emperors ruled Tibet - see List of emperors of Tibet. Throughout the centuries from the time of the emperor Songtsän Gampo the power of the empire gradually increased over a diverse terrain so that by the reign of the emperor Ralpacan in the opening years of the ninth century its influence extended as far south as Bengal and as far north as Mongolia.  

The varied terrain of the empire and the difficulty of transportation, coupled with the new ideas that came into the empire as a result of its expansion, helped to create stresses and power blocs that were often in competition with the ruler at the center of the empire.  Thus, for example, adherents of the Bon religion and the supporters of the ancient noble families gradually came to find themselves in competition with the recently-introduced Buddhism.

=== Reign of Namri Songtsen (or Namri Löntsän) ===
The enrgic  Namri Songtsen united some tribes of is valley and quickly progressed into the expansion of his territories, setting up the basis of future military exploits.

===Reign of Songtsän Gampo===
<!-- PLEASE CROSS CHECK CHANGES HERE WITH TEXT AT Songtsen Gampo -->
Songtsän Gampo (Wylie: ''Srong-brtsan Sgam-po'') (born ca. 604, died 650) was the great emperor who expanded Tibet's power, and is traditionally credited with inviting Buddhism to Tibet. When his father, Namri Löntsän died by poisoning, circa 618,<ref>Beckwith, Christopher I. 1987. ''The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia: A History of the Struggle for Great Power among Tibetans, Turks, Arabs, and Chinese during the Early Middle Ages''. Princeton University Press. ISBN 0-691-02469-3, pp. 19-20 (OTC, vi).</ref> Songtsän Gampo took control, after putting down a brief rebellion. 
thumb|A statue of Emperor Songtsän Gampo in a cave at [[Yerpa]] 

Songtsän Gampo proved adept at diplomacy, as well as in combat. The emperor's minister Myang Mangpoje () defeated Sumpa ca. 627.<ref name="OTA">''Old Tibetan Annals'', hereafter OTA l. 2</ref> Six years later (c. 632-3) Myang Mangpoje was accused of treason and executed.<ref>OTA l. 4-5</ref><ref name="Richardson1965">Richardson, Hugh E. (1965). "How Old was Srong Brtsan Sgampo," ''Bulletin of Tibetology'' 2.1. pp. 5-8.</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>OTA l. 8-10</ref> He was succeeded by minister Gar Songtsän (''Mgar-srong-rtsan'').

The Chinese records mention an envoy in 634. On that occasion, the Emperor requested marriage to a Chinese princess and was refused. In 635-6 the Emperor attacked and defeated the Azha (Tibetan: ''‘A zha''; Chinese: Tüyühün) people, who lived around Lake Koko Nur in the northeast corner of Tibet, and who controlled important trade routes into China. After a Tibetan campaign against China in 635-6,<ref>OTA l. 607</ref> the Chinese emperor agreed to provide a Chinese princess to Songtsän Gampo. 

Circa 639, after Songtsän Gampo had a dispute with his younger brother Tsänsong (''Brtsan-srong''), the younger brother was burnt to death by his own minister Khäsreg (''Mkha’s sregs'') (presumably at the behest of his older brother the emperor).<ref name="Richardson1965" /><ref name=autogenerated1 />

The Chinese princess Wencheng (Tibetan ''Mung-chang Kung-co'') departed China in 640 to marry Songtsän Gampo. She arrived a year later. Peace between China and Tibet prevailed for the remainder of Songtsän Gampo's reign.

Songtsän Gampo’s sister Sämakar (''Sad-mar-kar'') was sent to marry Lig-myi-rhya, the king of Zhang Zhung. However, when the king refused to consummate the marriage, she then helped her brother to defeat Lig myi-rhya and incorporate Zhang Zhung into the Tibetan Empire.

In 645, Songtsän Gampo overran the kingdom of Zhang Zhung in what is now Western Tibet. 

Songtsän Gampo died in 650. He was succeeded by his infant grandson Trimang Lön (''Khri-mang-slon''). Real power was left in the hands of the minister Gar Songtsän.

===Reign of Mangsong Mangtsen (650-676)===

Tibetan forces conquered the 'A-zha or Tuyuhun Kingdom of modern Qinghai and Gansu to the northeast in 663 CE.<ref></ref> Tibet also controlled the Tarim Basin and adjoining regions (now called Xinjiang), including the city of Kashgar, from 670<ref></ref> to 692 AD, when they were defeated by Chinese forces.<ref></ref> The minister Gar Songtsän died in 667, after having incorporated Azha into Tibetan territory.  

Between 665-670 Khotan was defeated by the Tibetans, and a long string of conflicts with the Chinese T'ang Dynasty over territories in the Tarim Basin including the city of Kashgar began in 670 and lasted until 692.<ref>Beckwith, 36, 146</ref> Emperor Mangsong Mangtsen ('''Trimang Löntsen''' or '''Khri-mang-slon-rtsan''') married Thrimalö (''Khri-ma-lod''), a woman who would be of great importance in Tibetan history. The emperor died in the winter of 676-677, and Zhang Zhung revolts thereafter. In the same year the emperor's son, 'Dus-rong Mang-po-rje ('''Tridu Songtsän''' or '''Khri-'dus-srong-rtsan'''), was born.<ref name="Beckwith1987" />

===Reign of 'Dus-rong Mang-po-rje (677-704)===
thumb|300px|Tibet's Empire in 700 AD.
Emperor Thrimalö on the one hand and the influential Gar (''Mgar'') clan on the other hand. In 685, the minister, Gar Tännyädombu (''Mgar Bstan-snyas-ldom-bu'') died and his brother, Gar Thridringtsändrö (''Mgar Khri-‘bring-btsan brod'') was appointed to replace him.<ref>Beckwith 1987: 50</ref> In 692, the Tibetans lost the Tarim Basin to the Chinese. Gar Thridringtsändrö defeated the Chinese in battle in 696, and sued for peace. Two years later in 698 emperor Tridu Songtsän invited the Gar clan (over 2000 people) to a hunting party and had them executed. Gar Thridringtsändrö then committed suicide, and his troops loyal to him joined the Chinese. This brought to end the power of the Gar family.<ref name=autogenerated7>Beckwith, Christopher I.

From 700 until his death the emperor remained on campaign in the north-east, absent from Central Tibet, while his mother Thrimalö administrated in his name.<ref name="Petech">Petech, Luciano (1988).

At the end of that year, the Tibetan imperial government turned to consolidating the administrative organization () of the northeastern Sumru () area, which had been the Sumpa country conquered 75 years earlier. Sumru was organized as a new "horn" of the empire. During the summer of 703, Tridu Songtsän resided at Öljag (''‘Ol-byag'') in Ling (''Gling''), which was on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, before proceeding with an invasion of Jang (''‘Jang'') or Nan-chao.

===Reign of Mes-ag-tshoms (704-754)===

Gyältsugru (), later to become King Tride Tsuktsän (''Khri-lde-gtsug-brtsan''), generally known now by his nickname Mes-ag-tshoms ("Old Hairy"),  was born in 704. Upon the death of 'Dus-rong Mang-po-rje (Tridu Songtsen), his wife Thrimalö ruled as regent for the infant Gyältsugru.<ref name="Petech" /> The following year the elder son of Tridu Songtsen, by the name of Lha Balpo (''Lha Bal-pho'') apparently contested the succession of his one-year-old brother but, at Pong Lag-rang, Lha Balpo was "deposed from the throne".<ref name="Petech" /><ref>Beckwith, C.

Thrimalö had arranged for a royal marriage to a Chinese princess. The Princess Jincheng (金成) (Tibetan: Kyimshang Kongjo) arrived in 710, but it is somewhat unclear whether she married the seven year old Gyältsugru<ref>Yamaguchi 1996: 232</ref>, or the deposed Lha Balpo.<ref>Beckwith 1983: 276.</ref> He also married a lady from Jang (Nanzhao) and another born in Nanam.<ref>Stein, R.

Gyältsugru was officially enthroned with the royal name Tride Tsuktsän in 712,<ref name="Petech" /> the same year that dowager emperess Thrimalö died. 

The Arabs and Turgis became increasingly prominent during 710-720. The Tibetans were allied with the Arabs and eastern Turks. Tibet and China fought on and off in the late 720s.  At first Tibet (with Turgis allies) had the upper hand, but then started losing battles. After a rebellion in southern China, and a major Tibetan victory in 730, the Tibetans and Turgis sued for peace.  

In 734 the Tibetans married their princess Dronmalön (''‘Dron ma lon'') to the Turgis Qaghan. The Chinese allied with the Arabs to attack the Turgis. After victory and peace with the Turgis, the Chinese attacked the Tibet army. The Tibetans suffered several defeats in the east, despite strength in the west. The Turgis empire collapsed from internal strife. In 737, the Tibetans launched an attack against the king of Bru-za (Gilgit), who asked for Chinese help, but was ultimately forced to pay homage to Tibet. In 747, the hold of Tibet was loosened by the campaign of general Gao Xianzhi, who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and Kashmir.  By 750 the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian colonial possessions to the Chinese. 

By 750 the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian possessions to the Chinese. In 753, even the kingdom of "Little Balur" (modern Gilgit) was captured by the Chinese. However, after Gao Xianzhi's defeat by the Arabs and Qarluqs at the Battle of Talas river (751), Chinese influence decreased rapidly and Tibetan influence began to increase again. Tibet conquered large sections of northern India and even briefly took control of the Chinese capital Chang'an in 763 during the chaos of the An Shi Rebellion and even installed another Emperor on the throne of China, though his reign lasted only fifteen days.<ref>Stein, R.

In 755 Tride Tsuktsän was killed by the ministers Lang and Bal. Then Tagdra Lukong (''Stag-sgra Klu-khong'') presented evidence to prince Song Detsän (''Srong-lde-brtsan'') that "they were disloyal", were causing dissension in the country, and were about to injure him also. … Subsequently, Lang and ‘Bal really did revolt, they were killed by the army, their property was confiscated, and Klu khong was, one assumes, richly rewarded."<ref>Beckwith 1983: 273</ref>

In the meantime, the Uyghurs, nominal allies of the Tang emperors, continued to make difficulties along Tibet's Northern border. Toward the end of this king's reign, in fact, Uyghur victories in the North caused the Tibetans to lose a number of their allies in the Southeast.<ref>Beckwith 1987: 144-157.</ref>

Recent historical research indicates the presence of Christianity in as early as the sixth and seventh centuries, a period when the White Huns had extensive links with the Tibetans.<ref>Palmer, Martin, ''The Jesus Sutras,''  Mackays Limited, Chatham, Kent, Great Britain, 2001)</ref> A strong presence existed by the eighth century when Patriarch Timothy I (727-823) in 782 calls the Tibetans one of the more significant communities of the eastern church and wrote of the need to appoint another bishop in ca. 794.<ref>Hunter, Erica, "The Church of the East in Central Asia," ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'', 78, no.3 (1996)</ref>

===Reign of Mune Tsenpo (c. 797-799?)===
The reign of Wylie ''Mu ne btsanpo'') is scantily recorded.

===Reign of Sadnalegs (799-815)===
thumb|300px|Tibet's Empire in 800 AD.
Under Tride Songtsän (Khri lde srong brtsan - generally known as Sadnalegs) there was a protracted war with Arab powers to the west.  It appears that Tibetans captured a number of Arab troops and pressed them into service on the eastern frontier in 801.  Tibetans were active as far west as Samarkand and Kabul.  Arab forces began to gain the upper hand, and the Tibetan governor of Kabul submitted to the Arabs and became a Muslim about 812 or 815.  The Arabs then struck east from Kashmir, but were held off by the Tibetans.  In the meantime, the Uyghur Empire attacked Tibet from the northeast.  Strife between the Uyghurs and Tibetans continued for some time.<ref>Beckwith, ''Tibetan'', pp 157-165</ref>

===Reign of Ralpacan (815-838)===
Wylie ''Khri gtsug lde brtsan'') is important to Tibetan Buddhists as one of the three '''Dharma Kings''' who brought Buddhism to Tibet. He was a generous supporter of Buddhism and invited many craftsmen, scholars and translators to Tibet from neighbouring countries. He also promoted the development of written Tibetan and translations, which were greatly aided by the development of a detailed Sanskrit-Tibetan lexicon called the ''Mahavyutpatti'' which included standard Tibetan equivalents for thousands of Sanskrit terms.<ref name=autogenerated6>Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D. (1967). ''Tibet: A Political History'', pp. 49-50. Yale University Press, New Haven & London.</ref><ref>''Ancient Tibet: Research Materials from the Yeshe De Project'' (1986), pp. 296-297. Dharma Publishing, California. ISBN 0-89800-146-3.</ref>

Tibetans attacked Uyghur territory in 816 and were in turn attacked in 821. After successful Tibetan raids into Chinese territory, Buddhists in both countries sought mediation.<ref name=autogenerated6 /> 

Ralpacan was apparently murdered by two pro-Bon ministers who then placed his anti-Buddhist brother, Langdarma, on the throne.<ref>Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D. (1967). ''Tibet: A Political History'', p. 51. Yale University Press, New Haven & London.</ref>

Tibet continued to be a major Central Asian empire until the mid-9th century. It was under the reign of Ralpacan that the political power of Tibet was at its greatest extent, stretching as far as Mongolia and Bengal, and entering into treaties with China on a mutual basis.

====The Great Sino-Tibetan Peace Treaty of 821/822 CE====
A Sino-Tibetan treaty was agreed on in 821/822 under Ralpacan, which established peace for more than two decades.<ref>Beckwith 1987: 165-167</ref> A bilingual account of this treaty is inscribed on a stone pillar which stands outside the Jokhang temple in Lhasa. Here is the main core of this remarkable agreement:

:".... The great king of Tibet, the supernaturally wise divinity, the ''btsan-po'' and the great king of China, the Chinese ruler Hwang Te, Nephew and Uncle, having consulted about the alliance of their dominions have made a great treaty and ratified the agreement. In order that it may never be changed, all gods and men have been made aware of it and taken as witnesses; and so that it may be celebrated in every age and in every generation the terms of agreement have been inscribed on a stone pillar.
:The supernaturally wise divinity, the ''btsan-po'', Khri Gtsug-lde-brtsan himself and the Chinese ruler, B'un B'u He'u Tig Hwang Te, their majesties the Nephew and Uncle, through the great profundity of their minds know whatsoever is good and ill for present and future alike. With great compassion, making no distinction between outer and inner in sheltering all with kindness, they have agreed in their counsel on a great purpose of lasting good—the single thought of causing happiness for the whole population—and have renewed the respectful courtesies of their old friendship. Having consulted to consolidate still further the measure of neighbourly contentment they have made a great treaty. Both Tibet and China shall keep the country and frontiers of which they are now in possession. The whole region to the east of that being the country of Great China and the whole region to the west being assuredly the country of Great Tibet, from either side of that frontier there should be no warfare, no hostile invasions, and no seizure of territory. If there be any suspicious person, he shall be arrested and an investigation made and, having been suitably provided for, he shall be sent back.
:Now that the dominions are allied and a great treaty of peace has been made in this way, since it is necessary also to continue the communications between Nephew and Uncle, envoys setting out from either side shall follow the old established route. According to former custom their horses shall be changed at Tsang Kun Yog which is between Tibet and China. Beyond Stse Zhung Cheg, where Chinese territory is met, the Chinese shall provide all facilities, beyond Tseng Shu Hywan, where Tibetan territory is met, the Tibetans shall provide all facilities. According to the close and friendly relationship between Nephew and Uncle the customary courtesy and respect shall be observed. Between the two countries no smoke or dust shall appear. Not even a word of sudden alarm or of enmity shall be spoken and from those who guard the frontier upwards all shall live at ease without suspicion or fear both on their land and in their beds. Dwelling in peace they shall win the blessing of happiness for ten thousand generations. The sound of praise shall extend to every place reached by the sun and moon. And in order that this agreement establishing a great era when Tibetans shall be happy in Tibet and Chinese shall be happy in China shall never be changed, the Three Jewels, the body of saints, the sun and moon, planets and stars have been invoked as witnesses; its purport has been expounded in solemn words; the oath has been sworn with the sacrifice of animals; and the agreement has been solemnized.
:If the parties do not act in accordance with this agreement or if it is violated, whether it be Tibet or China that is first guilty of an offence against it, whatever stratagem or deceit is used in retaliation shall not be considered a breach of the agreement.
:Thus the rulers and ministers of both Tibet and China declared, and swore the oath; and the text having been written in detail it was sealed with the seals of both great kings. It was inscribed with the signatures of those ministers who took part in the agreement and the text of the agreement was deposited in the archives of each party...."<ref>Translated by H. E. Richardson in: ''A Corpus of Early Tibetan Inscriptions''. H. E. Richardson. Royal Asiatic Society (1985), pp. 119-127. ISBN 0-94759300/4.</ref>

===Reign of Langdarma (838-842)===
The reign of Wylie ''Glang dar ma''), whose regal title was in fact Tri Uidumtsaen (''Khri 'U'i dum brtsan''), was plagued by external troubles. The Uyghur state to the north collapsed under pressure from the Kyrgyz in 840, and many displaced people fled to Tibet.  Langdarma himself was assassinated, apparently by a Buddhist hermit, in 842.<ref>Beckwith, Christopher I. 1987. ''The Tibetan empire in Central Asia: A History of the Struggle for Great Power among Tibetans, Turks, Arabs, and Chinese during the Early Middle Ages''. Princeton University Press, pp. 168-169. ISBN 0-691-02469-3.</ref><ref>Shakabpa, p. 54.</ref>

==Tibet divided (842-1247)==
Upon the death of Langdarma, there was a controversy over whether he would be succeeded by his alleged heir Yumtän (Wylie: Yum brtan), or by another son (or nephew) Ösung (Wylie: 'Od-srung) (either 843-905 or 847-885). A civil war ensued, which effectively ended centralized Tibetan administration until the Sa-skya period. Ösung's allies managed to keep control of Lhasa, and Yumtän was forced to go to Yalung, where he established a separate line of kings.  <ref>Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa, ''Tibet, a Political History'' (New Haven:  Yale, 1967), 53.</ref>  In 910 the tombs of the emperors were defiled.

The son of Ösung was Pälkhortsän (Wylie: Dpal 'khor brtsan) (either 893-923 or  865-895). The latter apparently maintained control over much of central Tibet for a time, and sired two sons, Trashi Tsentsän (Wylie: Bkra shis brtsen brtsan) and Thrikhyiding (Wylie: Khri khyi lding), also called Kyide Nyigön [Wylie: Skyid lde nyi ma mgon] in some sources. Thrikhyiding emigrated to the western Tibetan region of upper Ngari (Wylie: Stod Mnga ris) and married a woman of high central Tibetan nobility, with whom he founded a local dynasty. <ref>Petech, L. The Kingdom of Ladakh. (Serie Orientale Roma 51) Rome: Instituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente, 1977: 14-16</ref>

After the breakup of the Tibetan empire in 842, Nyima-Gon, a representative of the ancient Tibetan royal house, founded the first Ladakh dynasty. Nyima-Gon's kingdom had its centre well to the east of present-day Ladakh. Kyide Nyigön's eldest son became ruler of the Mar-yul (Ladakh) region, and his two younger sons ruled western Tibet, founding the Kingdom of Guge and Pu-hrang. At a later period the king of Guge's eldest son, Kor-re, also called Jangchub Yeshe Ö (Byang Chub Ye shes' Od), became a Buddhist monk.  He sent young scholars to Kashmir for training and was responsible for inviting Atisha to Tibet in 1040, thus ushering in the Chidar (Phyi dar) phase of Buddhism in Tibet.  The younger son, Srong-nge, administered day to day governmental affairs; it was his sons who carried on the royal line. <ref>Hoffman, Helmut, "Early and Medieval Tibet", in Sinor, David, ed., ''Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia'' Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 1990), 388, 394.  Shakabpa, 56.</ref>

Central rule was largely nonexistent over the Tibetan region from 842 to 1247, yet Buddhism had survived surreptitiously in the region of Kham.  During the reign of Langdarma three monks had escaped from the troubled region of Lhasa to the region of Mt. Dantig in Amdo.  Their disciple Muzu Saelbar (Mu-zu gSal-'bar), later known as the scholar Gongpa Rabsal (Dgongs-pa rab-gsal) (832-915), was responsible for the renewal of Buddhism in northeastern Tibet, and is counted as the progenitor of the Nyingma (Rnying ma pa) school of Tibetan Buddhism.  Meanwhile, according to tradition, one of Ösung's descendants, who had an estate near Samye, sent ten young men to be trained by Gongpa Rabsal.  Among the ten was Lume Sherab Tshulthrim (Klu-mes Shes-rab Tshul-khrims) (950-1015).  Once trained, these young men were ordained to go back into the central Tibetan regions of U and Tsang.  The young scholars were able to link up with Atisha shortly after 1042 and advance the spread and organization of Buddhism in Lho-kha.  In that region, the faith eventually coalesced again, with the foundation of the Sakya Monastery in 1073.<ref name="Grun37">Grunfeld, A. Tom, ''The Making of Modern Tibet'', 1996, p37-38.  Hoffman, 393. Shakabpa, 54-55.</ref>  Over the next two centuries, the Sakya monastery grew to a position of prominence in Tibetan life and culture.  The Tsurphu Monastery, home of the Karmapa sect of Buddhism, was founded in 1155.

==The Mongols and the Sakya school (1236-1354)==
Tibetans learned in 1207 that Tangut empire. The first documented contact between the Tibetans and the Mongols occurred when Genghis Khan met Tsangpa Dunkhurwa (Gtsang pa Dung khur ba) and six of his disciples, probably in the Tangut empire, in 1215. <ref>Petech, L. Central Tibet and The Mongols. (Serie Orientale Roma 65). Rome: Instituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente 1990: 6.  Shakabpa, 61.</ref> 

After the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, his extensive empire was divided between several brothers and the Tibetans stopped sending tribute to the Mongols turned their attention to Tibet. At that time, Mongol armies had already conquered Northern China, much of Central Asia, and were operating in Russia and what is now Ukraine. The Tibetan nobility, however, was fragmented and mainly occupied with internal strife. It was essentially a feudal society composed of numerous principalities constantly at war with one another. 

As a result, in 1240, the grandson of Genghis Khan and second son of Song China from the west. During this expedition the Ögödei the Mongol Qaghan in 1241 brought Mongol military activity around the world temporarily to a halt. 

Prince Godan asked his commanders to search for an outstanding Buddhist lama and, as Sakya Pandita was considered the most religious, Godan sent a letter of "invitation" and presents to him. 

Mongol interest in Tibet resumed in 1244 when Godan sent an invitation to Bengali scholar Chana Dorje (''Phyag-na Rdo-rje''; 1239-67) in 1246. Prince Godan received various initiation rites and the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism became the religion of the ruling line of Mongol khans. In return, after a second Mongol invasion in 1247 led to the submission of almost all Tibetan states, Sakya Pandita was appointed Viceroy of Tibet by the Mongol court in 1249, marking one of the occasions on which the Chinese base their claim to the rule of Tibet.

On the other hand, because Song China in South China had not yet been conquered by the Mongols, Tibetan historians argue that China and Tibet remained two separate units within the Mongol Empire.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> It may therefore be more accurate to describe this process as first North China, and then Tibet being incorporated into the Mongol Empire, which later inherited by the Yuan Dynasty founded by Kublai Khan in 1271, the largest division of the Mongol Empire, which then conquered South China in 1279. 
right|thumb|200px|Kublai Khan 

In a delicate balance aimed at ruling both territories while preserving Mongol identity, Kublai Khan prohibited Mongols from marrying Chinese, but left both the Chinese and Tibetan legal and administrative systems intact.<ref>Schirokauer, Conrad. ''A Brief History of Chinese Civilization.'' Thomson Wadsworth, (c)2006, p 174</ref> Tibet never adopted the Chinese system of exams or Neo-Confucian policies. 

When Qaghan in 1251, he assigned the various districts of Tibet as appanages to his relatives.  Kublai Khan was appointed by Möngke Khan to take charge over the Chinese campaigns in 1253. Since Sakya Pandit'ta had already died by this time, Kublai took Drogön Chögyal Phagpa into his camp as a symbol of Tibet's subjugation. After the death of Sakya Pandita, Phagpa remained at the camp of Prince Godan and learned Mongolian language. 

In 1253, Phagpa (1235-1280) succeeded Sakya Pandita at the Mongol court. Phagpa became a religious teacher to Goden Khan's famous successor, Kublai Khan. Kublai Khan named Phagpa the Imperial Preceptor of Tibet, offering him the rule of all Tibet. 

Five years later, khan, the ruler of the Mongols and later on even became Emperor of China.

Kublai Khan in turn appointed Chögyal Phagpa as his Imperial Preceptor in 1260, the year when he became emperor of Mongolia. Phagpa was the first "to initiate the political theology of the relationship between state and religion in the Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhist world".<ref>Laird, Thomas (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', p. 115. Grove Press, N.Y. ISBN 978-0-8021-827-1.</ref><ref name=autogenerated9>F. W. Mote. ''Imperial China 900-1800''. Harvard University Press, 1999. p.501.</ref> With the support of Kublai Khan, Chögyal Phagpa established himself and his sect as the preeminent political power in Tibet. 

Through their influence with the Mongol rulers, Tibetan lamas gained considerable influence in various Mongol clans, not only with Kublai, but, for example, also with the Yuan empire, and Sakya would become the administrative center of Tibet. Tibet would also enjoy a rather high degree of autonomy compared to other parts of the Yuan empire, though further expeditions took place in 1267, 1277, 1281 and 1290/91.<ref>Dieter Schuh, ''Tibet unter der Mongolenherrschaft'', in: Michael Weiers (editor), ''Die Mongolen. Beiträge zu ihrer Geschichte und Kultur'', Darmstadt 1986, p. 283-289</ref>

Kublai Khan commissioned Chögyal Phagpa to design a new Korean script. However, it fell into disuse after the collapse of the Mongol Empire and the associated Yuan Dynasty in 1368.<ref>Laird, Thomas (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', pp. 115-116. Grove Press, N.Y. ISBN 978-0-8021-827-1.</ref><ref name=autogenerated9 />

Kublai was elected Qaghan in 1260 following the death of his brother Möngke, although his title was not uncontested. At that point he named Drogön Chögyal Phagpa 'state preceptor'. In 1265 Drogön Chögyal Phagpa returned to Tibet and for the first time made an attempt to impose Sakya hegemony with the appointment of Shakya Bzang-po (a long time servant and ally of the Sakyas) as the Dpon-chen ('great administrator') over Tibet in 1267. A census was conducted in 1268 and Tibet was divided into thirteen myriarchies.

In 1269 Drogön Chögyal Phagpa returned to Kublai's side at his new capital, Hülegü Khan of the Ilkhanate in 1285. The revolt was suppressed in 1290 when the Sa-skyas and eastern Mongols burned Drikung Monastery and killed 10,000 people.<ref name="Wylie">Wylie, Turnell V. (1977) "The First Mongol Conquest of Tibet Reinterpreted," ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 37.1: 103-133.</ref>

Between 1346 and 1354, towards the end of the Yuan dynasty, the House of Pagmodru would topple the Sakya. Tibet would be ruled by a succession of Sakya lamas until 1358, when central Tibet came under control of the Kagyu sect. "By the 1370s the lines between the schools of Buddhism were clear."<ref>Laird, Thomas (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', p. 124. Grove Press, N.Y. ISBN 978-0-8021-827-1.</ref>

The following 80 years or so were a period of relative stability. They also saw the birth of the Tsongkhapa Lobsang Dragpa, and the founding of the Sera monasteries near Lhasa. After the 1430s, the country entered another period of internal power struggles.<ref>Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, ''Kleine Geschichte Tibets'', München 2006, p. 98-104</ref>

== Rise of the Phagmodru (1354-1434)==

The Phagmodru (Phag mo gru) myriarchy centered at Neudong (Sne'u gdong) was granted as an appanage to Hülegü in 1251. The area had already been associated with the Lang (Rlang) family, and with the waning of Ilkhanate influence it was ruled by this family, within the Mongol-Sakya framework headed by the Mongol appointed Pönchen (Dpon chen) at Sakya. The areas under Lang administration were continually encroached upon during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. Janchub Gyaltsän (Byang chub rgyal mtshan, 1302-1364) saw these encroachments as illegal and sought the restoration of Phagmodru lands after his appointment as the Myriarch in 1322. After prolonged legal struggles, the struggle became violent when Phagmodru was attacked by its neighbours in 1346. Jangchub Gyaltsän was arrested and released in 1347. When he later refused to appear for trial, his domains were attacked by the Pönchen in 1348. Janchung Gyaltsän was able to defend Phagmodru, and continued to have military successes, until by 1351 he was the strongest political figure in the country. Military hostilities ended in 1354 with Jangchub Gyaltsän as the unquestioned victor. He continued to rule central Tibet until his death in 1364, although he left all Mongol institutions in place as hollow formalities. Power remained in the hands of the Phagmodru family until 1434. <ref> Petech, L. Central Tibet and The Mongols. (Serie Orientale Roma 65).

Sonam Gyatso's message was that the time had come for Mongolia to embrace Buddhism; that from that time on there should be no more animal sacrifices; the images of the old gods were to be destroyed; there must be no taking of life, animal or human; military action must be given up; and the immolation of women on the funeral pyres of their husbands must be abolished.<ref>Norbu, Thubten Jigme and Turnbull, Colin M.

Sonam Gyatso publicly announced that he was a reincarnation of the Tibetan Sakya monk Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235-1280) who converted Kublai Khan, while Altan Khan was a reincarnation of Kublai Khan (1215-1294), the famous ruler of the Mongols and Emperor of China, and that they had come together again to cooperate in propagating the Buddhist religion.<ref>Laird, Thomas (2006).

==The origin of the title of 'Dalai Lama'==   
thumb|200px|Hayagriva (guard of the doctrines: dharmapala), fine copper, 15th-16th century

It has been commonly wrongly believed that the Mongol Altan Khan "bestowed" the "title" ''Dalai Lama'' on Sonam Gyatso, and placed him in a reincarnation line with Gendun Drup and Gendun Gyatso in 1578. 

:"More confusing in our time is that many writers have mistranslated ''Dalai Lama'' as "Ocean of Wisdom." The full Mongolian title, "the wonderful Vajradhara, good splendid meritorious ocean," given by Altan Khan, is primarily a translation of the Tibetan words ''Sonam Gyatso'' (''sonam'' is "merit")." 

:The 14th Dalai Lama added: "The very name of each Dalai Lama from the Second Dalai Lama onwards had the word Gyatso ''(in it)'', which means 'ocean' in Tibetan. Even now I am Tenzin Gyatso, so the first name is changing but the second part (''the word "ocean"'') became like part of each Dalai Lama's name. All of the Dalai Lamas, since the Second, have this name. So I don't really agree that the Mongols actually conferred a title. It was just a translation."<ref>Laird, Thomas (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', pp. 142-143. Grove Press, N.Y. ISBN 978-0-8021-827-1.</ref>

The name or title 'Dalai Lama' may have originally derived from the title taken by Temüjin or Genghis Khan when he was proclaimed emperor of a united Mongolia in 1206. Temüjin took the name Tchingis Qaghan or "oceanic sovereign", the anglicized version of which is Genghis Khan.<ref>Roux, Jean-Paul. (2003). ''Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire'', p. 25. Trans from the French by Toula Balas. Thames & Hudson. London. ISBN 0-500-30113-1.</ref>

==Rise of the Geluk school==
Yonten Gyatso (1589 – 1616), the fourth Dalai Lama and a non-Tibetan, was the grandson of Altan Khan. He died in 1617 in his mid-twenties. Some people say he was poisoned but there is no real evidence one way or the other.<ref>Laird, Thomas (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', pp. 147, 149. Grove Press, N.Y. ISBN 978-0-8021-827-1.</ref>

Lobsang Gyatso (Wylie transliteration: Blo-bzang Rgya-mtsho), the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, (1617-1682) was the first Dalai Lama to wield effective political power over central Tibet. 

The fifth Dalai Lama is known for unifying Tibet under the control of the twentieth century.

In Shunzhi. He was not required to kowtow like other visitors, but still had to kneel before the Emperor; and he received a seal.

The fifth Dalai lama initiated the construction of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, and moved the centre of government there from Drepung.
right|thumb|350px|The Potala Palace in Lhasa
The death of the fifth Dalai Lama in 1680 was kept hidden for fifteen years by his assistant, confidant, and possibly son, Desi Sangay Gyatso (''De-srid Sangs-rgyas Rgya-'mtsho''). The Dalai Lamas remained Tibet's titular heads of state until 1959.

During the rule of the Great Fifth, two Jesuit missionaries, the German Johannes Gruber and Belgian Albert Dorville, stayed in Lhasa for two months, October and November, 1661 on their way from Peking to Goa in India.<ref name="Wessels001">

Another Jesuit, Ippolito Desideri, stayed five years in Lhasa (1716-1721) and was the first missionary to master the language. He even produced a few Christian books in Tibetan. Capuchin fathers took over the mission until all missionaries were expelled in 1745.

In the late seventeenth century, Tibet entered into a dispute with Bhutan, which was supported by Ladakh. This resulted in an invasion of Ladakh by Tibet. KashmirI helped to restore Ladakhi rule, on the condition that a mosque be built in Leh and that the Ladakhi king convert to Islam. The Treaty of Temisgam in 1684 settled the dispute between Tibet and Ladakh, but its independence was severely restricted.

==Khoshud, Dzungars, and Manchu==
In the 1630s, Tibet became entangled in the power struggles between the rising Yellow Hat sect. He died on the way in Fifth Dalai Lama to establish himself as the highest spiritual and political authority in Tibet and destroyed any potential rivals, like the prince of Tsang. The time of the Fifth Dalai Lama was, however, also a period of rich cultural development.

The Fifth Dalai Lama's death was kept secret for fifteen years by the regent (), Sanggye Gyatso. This was apparently done so that the Potala Palace could be finished, and to prevent Tibet's neighbours taking advantage of an interregnum in the succession of the Dalai Lamas.<ref>Laird, Thomas. (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', pp. 181-182. Grove Press, New York. ISBN 978-0-8021-1827-1.</ref> 

Tsangyang Gyatso, the Sixth Dalai Lama, was not enthroned until 1697. Tsangyang Gyatso enjoyed a lifestyle that included drinking, the company of women, and writing love songs.<ref>Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, ''Kleine Geschichte Tibets'', München 2006, pp. 109-122.</ref> In 1705, Lobzang Khan of the Khoshud used the sixth Dalai Lama's escapades as excuse to take control of Tibet. The regent was murdered, and the Dalai Lama sent to Beijing. He died on the way, near Kelzang Gyatso was discovered near Koko Nur and became a rival candidate.

The Dzungars invaded Tibet in 1717, deposed and killed Lobzang Khan's pretender to the position of Dalai Lama. This was widely approved.  However, they soon began to loot the holy places of Lhasa, which brought a swift response from Emperor Kangxi in 1718; but his military expedition was annihilated by the Dzungars, not far from Lhasa.<ref name=autogenerated11>Richardson, Hugh E.

A second, larger, expedition sent by Emperor Kangxi expelled the Dzungars from Tibet in 1720 and the troops were hailed as liberators. They brought Kelzang Gyatso with them from Kumbum to Lhasa and he was installed as the seventh Dalai Lama in 1721.<ref name=autogenerated11 /><ref>Schirokauer, 242</ref>

Following the Qing withdrawal from central Tibet in 1723, there was a period of civil war.

After the rebellion of a Qing made the region of Amdo and Kham into the province of Qinghai in 1724,<ref>Stein, R. A. (1972) ''Tibetan Civilization''; translated by J. E. Stapleton Driver, p. 88. Stanford University Press, Stanford, California. ISBN 0-8047-0806-1 (cloth); ISBN 0-8047-0901-7 (paper).</ref> and incorporated eastern Kham into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728.<ref name="wang" />  The Qing government sent a resident commissioner (amban) to Lhasa. 

:"The temporal power [in the mid 1840s] of the Supreme Lama ends at Bathang [see Batang Town]. the frontiers of Tibet, properly so called, were fixed in 1726, on the termination of a great war between the Tibetans and the Chinese. Two days before you arrive at Bathang, you pass, on the top of a mountain, a stone monument, showing what was arranged at that time between the government of Lha-Ssa and that of Peking, on the subject of boundaries. At present, the countries situate east of Bathang are independent of Lha-Ssa in temporal matters. They are governed by a sort of feudal princes, originally appointed by the Chinese Emperor, and still acknowledging his paramount authority. These petty sovereigns are bound to go every third year to Peking, to offer their tribute to the Emperor."<ref name=autogenerated3>Abbé Huc. ''The Land of the Lamas''. Taken from: ''Travels in Tartary, Thibet and China'', 1844-1846 by MM. Huc and Gabet, translated by William Hazlitt, p. 123.</ref>

Spencer Chapman gives a similar, but more detailed, account of this border agreement:

:"In 1727, as a result of the Chinese having entered Lhasa, the boundary between China and Tibet was laid down as between the head-waters of the Mekong and Yangtse rivers, and marked by a pillar, a little to the south-west of Batang. Land to the west of this pillar was administered from Lhasa, while the Tibetan chiefs of the tribes to the east came more directly under China. This historical Sino-Tibetan boundary was used until 1910. The states Der-ge, Nyarong, Batang, Litang, and the five Hor States—to name the more important districts—are known collectively in Lhasa as Kham, an indefinite term suitable to the Tibetan Government, who are disconcertingly vague over such details as treaties and boundaries."<ref>Chapman, F. Spencer. (1940). ''Lhasa: The Holy City'', p. 135. Readers Union Ltd., London.</ref> 

While the ancient Sino-Tibetan relations are complicated, there can be no question regarding the subordination of Tibet to Qing China following first decade of the 18th century.<ref>Goldstein, M.C., ''A History of Modern Tibet: The Demise of the Lamaist State'', University of California Press, p44</ref> In 1727, the government of China began posting two high commissioners, namely Ambans, to Lhasa. pro-Chinese historians argue that the ambans' presence was an expression of Chinese sovereignty, while those favouring Tibetan independence claims tend to equate the ambans with ambassadors. "The relationship between Tibet and (Qing) China was that of priest and patron and was not based on the subordination of one to the other," according to the Thirteenth Dalai Lama,<ref name="Dalai1913">[http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/tibet/tibet1.html "Proclamation Issued by His Holiness the Dalai Lama XIII (1913)"]</ref> (The thirteenth Dalai Lama was deposed (1904), reinstated (1908), and deposed (1910) again by the Qing Dynasty government.) <ref>http://cc.purdue.edu/~wtv/tibet/article/art4.html ''Tibet, China and the United States: Reflections on the Tibet Question'' by Melvyn C.

Pho-lha-nas, an important Tibetan aristocrat, ruled Tibet with Chinese support in 1728-47. In 1728 the young seventh Dalai Lama was invited to visit Beijing,<ref>Richardson, Hugh E. (1984). ''Tibet and its History''. Second Edition, Revised and Updated, p. 52. Shambhala. Boston & London. ISBN 0-87773-376-7 (pbk)</ref> but Pho-lha-nas only had him moved from Lhasa to Litang to make it more difficult for him to influence the government. After Pho-lha-nas died, his son ruled until he was killed by the ambans in 1750. This provoked riots during which the ambans were killed. A Chinese army entered the country and restored order. 

Tibetan factions rebelled in 1750 and killed the ambans. Then, a Emperor Qianlong established the Dalai Lama as both the spiritual leader and political leader of Tibet who lead a government (Emperor Qianlong no further attempts were made to integrate Tibet into the empire. Instead, Emperor Qianlong drew on Buddhism to bolster support among the Tibetans. Six thangkas remain portraying the emperor as Manjusri and Tibetan records of the time refer to him by that name.<ref>Shirokauer, ''A Brief History of Chinese Civilization'', Thompson Higher Education, (c) 2006, 244</ref> 

In 1788, Gurkha forces sent by Bahadur Shah, the Regent of [[Nepal, invaded Tibet, occupying a number of frontier districts. The young Panchen Lama fled to Lhasa and the Manchu Qianlong Emperor sent troops to Lhasa, upon which the Nepalese withdrew agreeing to pay a large annual sum.

In 1791 the Nepalese Gurkhas invaded Tibet a second time, seizing Shigatse and destroyed, plundered, and desecrated the great Tashilhunpo Monastery. The Panchen Lama was forced to flee to Lhasa once again. The Qianlong Emperor then sent an army of 17,000 men to Tibet. In 1793, with the assistance of Tibetan troops, they managed to drive the Nepalese troops to within about 30 km of Kathmandu before the Gurkhas conceded defeat and returned all the treasure they had plundered.<ref>Teltscher, Kate (2006).

==18th and 19th centuries==
====Removal of the Regents and establishment of the Kashag====

There are two main versions of how this occurred. The Chinese version is that:

In 1751, the Qianlong Emperor (1711-1799; ruled 1737-1796) issued a 13-point decree which abolished the position of regent (desi), put the Tibetan government in the hands of a four-man Kashag, or Council of Ministers, and gave the ambans formal powers. The Dalai Lama moved back to Lhasa to preside (in name) over the new government.

In 1751, at the age of forty-three, Kelzang Gyatso constituted the "Kashag" or council of ministers to administer the Tibetan government and abolished the post of Regent or Desi, as it placed too much power in one man’s hand and the Dalai Lama became the spiritual and political leader of Tibet.<ref>"Seventh Dalai Lama KELSANG GYATSO." [http://namgyalmonastery.org/hhdl/hhdl7]</ref> 

:"The 'king' or governor of Tibet was no longer appointed by the Chinese after 1750, and the Dalai Lama was tacitly recognized as sovereign of Tibet, with the exception of Kham and Amdo on the one hand and, on the other, Ladakh—which was at first under Moghul suzerainty before being annexed by Kashmir after the Dogra war (1834-42). China henceforth defended Tibet against foreign invasions (notably that of the Gurkhas, 1788-1792), but reserved the right in future to superintend the choice of a new Dalai or Panchen Lama, dictating a set of candidates from whom the final selection was to be made by lot in the presence of the ''ambans'' (1792). In addition, the Emperors loaded Lamaism with favours in China and Mongolia where they set up temples and monasteries and issued invitations, often permanently, to great incarnate Lamas of the Geluk-pa order, which had become the established Church."<ref>Stein, R.
