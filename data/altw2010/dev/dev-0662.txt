'''Iron Maiden''' are an English heavy metal band from Steve Harris, formerly a member of Gypsy's Kiss and Smiler. Iron Maiden are one of the most successful and influential bands in the heavy metal Hollywood RockWalk in UFO, Wishbone Ash, and Deep Purple amongst others.

==History of Iron Maiden==
===The early days (1975–1978)===
<!--Following section taken from Early Days DVD, and 12 Wasted Years video-->
Iron Maiden were formed on Steve Harris, shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributes the band name to a movie adaptation of ''The Man in the Iron Mask'' from the novel by Alexandre Dumas,and starring Patrick Mcgoohan (who also starred in the 1960's series purported torture device.<ref>Barton, Geoff. "BLOOD AND IRON: HM from the punky East End and nothing to do with Margaret Thatcher,
sez Deaf Barton", 27 October 1970, ''Sounds'' magazine, reported at [http://www.nwobhm.com/maiden.htm NWOBHM.com]; last accessed October 8, 2006.</ref>

Steve Harris and guitarist Dave Murray remain the longest-surviving members of Iron Maiden to this day. Original vocalist Paul Day was fired as he lacked "energy or charisma onstage".<ref>Wall, Mick (2001), p. 32.</ref> He was replaced by Kiss fan who utilised fire, make-up and fake blood during live performances. Wilcock's friend, Dave Murray, was invited to join, to the frustration of guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance.<ref name="Wall33">Wall, Mick (2001), p. 33.</ref> This fueled Harris to temporarily split the band in 1976,<ref name="Wall33"/> though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist.

Iron Maiden recruited another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who caused a rift between Murray and Wilcock, prompting Harris to fire both Murray and Sawyer.<ref>Wall, Mick (2001), p. 46.</ref> A poor gig at the Bridgehouse in November 1977, with a makeshift line-up including Tony Moore on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer Barry Purkis resulted in Harris firing the entire band.<ref>Wall, Mick (2001), p. 50.</ref> Dave Murray was reinstated and Doug Sampson was hired as drummer.

=== Rise to fame (1978-1981)===

A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Steve Harris has stated, "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge."<ref> Wall, Mick (2001), p. 53.</ref>

Iron Maiden had been playing for three years, but had never recorded any of their music. On Sanctuary" and "Wrathchild".

From late 1977 to 1978, Murray was the sole guitarist in the band until Urchin.<ref>Wall, Mick (2001), pps. 163-164.</ref> Drummer Doug Sampson was also replaced by Clive Burr (who was brought into the band by Stratton). In December 1979, the band landed a major record deal with EMI.<ref>Wall, Mick (2001), p. 108.</ref>

Iron Maiden's Iron Maiden'', made number 4 in the Transylvania", "Phantom of the Opera", and "Sanctuary" — which was not on the original UK release but made the U.S. release and subsequent re-releases. The band played a headline tour of the UK then went on to open for Kiss on their 1980 Unmasked Tour's European leg. Iron Maiden also supported Judas Priest on select dates. After the Kiss tour, Dennis Stratton was fired from the band as a result of creative and personal differences.<ref>Hinchcliffe, Jon. "Dennis Stratton Interview: October 1999", 27 October 1999, at [http://www.praying-mantis.com/mantis/dennis99.shtml Praying-Mantis.com]; last accessed October 8, 2006.</ref> Stratton was replaced by Adrian Smith in October 1980.

In 1981, Maiden released their second album, titled ''Killers''. This new album contained many tracks that had been written prior to the release of the debut album, but were considered surplus. With songs already shaped on the road well in advance, only two new tracks were written for the album: "Prodigal Son" and "Murders in the Rue Morgue"<ref>Wall, Mick (2001), p. 183.</ref> (the title was taken from the short story by Edgar Allan Poe).

=== International success (1981-1986) ===
By 1981, America. At the end of 1981 the band fired Di'Anno and began to seek a new vocalist.

Samson, auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and joined the band shortly afterwards. He then went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour. In anticipation of the band's forthcoming album, the band played "Children of the Damned", "Run to the Hills", "22 Acacia Avenue" and "The Prisoner" at select venues, introducing fans to the sound that the band was progressing towards.

Dickinson's recorded debut with Iron Maiden was 1982's ''The Number of the Beast'', an album that claimed the band their first ever UK Albums Chart number 1 record<ref name="Wall227">Wall, Mick (2001), p. 227.</ref> and additionally became a Top Ten hit in many other countries.<ref name="Wall228">Wall, Mick (2001), p. 228.</ref> For the second time the band went on a world tour, visiting the Satanic because of the new album's title track.<ref name="Wall228"/> The band members' attempts to deflect the criticism failed to dampen persistent accusations. A group of activists went on to destroy Iron Maiden records (along with those of Ozzy Osbourne) in protest against the band.

Dickinson at the time was still in legal difficulties with Samson's management, and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits. However, he was still able to lend "creative influence" to many of the songs.

In December 1982, drummer French band Trust. Shortly afterwards, in 1983, the band released ''Piece of Mind''.

Following the success of ''Piece of Mind'', the band released ''Powerslave'' on September 9, 1984. The album featured fan favourites "Aces High", and "Rime of The Ancient Mariner",<ref>Wall, Mick (2001), p. 244.</ref> the latter based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge's ''poem of the same name'' and running over 13 minutes in length. "Back in the Village" followed up on an earlier hit "The Prisoner", both based on the television show starring Patrick McGoohan.

The tour following the album, dubbed the World Slavery Tour, was the band's biggest to date and consisted of 193 shows over 13 months. This was one of the biggest tours in music history.<ref>Stenning, Paul (2006), p. 102.</ref> Many shows were played back-to-back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California, where most of the recordings were made for their subsequent live release ''Live After Death''. This tour was physically grueling for the band and they took a 6-month break when it ended. This was the first break in the band's history, including even cancelling a proposed supporting tour for the new live album.<ref>Stenning, Paul (2006), p. 104.</ref>

===Experimentation (1986-1990)===
Returning from their break, the band adopted a different approach for their 1986 studio album, titled ''Somewhere in Time''. This was not a synthesized bass and guitars sounds to add textures and layers to the sound. Though considered different from the norm of Maiden sounds, it charted well across the world, especially with the single "Wasted Years". The band had resisted using synthetic sounds before, and still insisted on not using keyboards. At the time they claimed the music was still 'real' since actual guitars/bass guitars had been used.

The experimentation on ''Somewhere in Time'' led to a follow-up in ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'', 1988. Adding to Iron Maiden's experimentation, it was a clairvoyant powers. For the first time, the band used keyboards on a recording, as opposed to guitar synthesisers on the previous release. Critics stated this produced a more accessible release.<ref>[http://www.adriandenning.co.uk/maiden.html Adrian's Album Reviews : Iron Maiden<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It was a huge success, and became the band's second album to hit #1 in the UK charts.

In 1990, to close Iron Maiden's first ten years of releasing singles, Iron Maiden released ''12" vinyls. Between February 24 and April 28, 1990, the individual parts were released one-by-one, and each contains two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the B-sides.

=== Upheaval (1990–1994)===
In 1989, after touring with Iron Maiden, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band ASAP entitled ''Silver and Gold''. In 1990, vocalist Bruce Dickinson launched a solo career with former Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, releasing ''Tattooed Millionaire''. The band had spent 1989 off, and Dickinson took this time to work on the album. Though seen as good creations at the time, these solo albums would eventually inspire both band members to leave later on.

Soon after work on a new album began, Adrian Smith was let go due to lack of enthusiasm. Bruce Dickinson's solo project guitarist Janick Gers was chosen to replace Smith - the first new member in seven years. When Dickinson left Maiden in 1993, he would later regroup with Smith.

In 1990, Iron Maiden released the album ''No Prayer for the Dying''. This album had a raw sound compared to their recent releases and featured one last song co-written by Adrian Smith, "Hooks in You", despite Smith's having left the band prior to the recording of the album.

The band obtained their first (and to date, only) UK Singles Chart number one hit single with "Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter", originally recorded by Dickinson for the soundtrack to ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child''. It was released on December 24, 1990, and was one of the first records to be released on several different formats with different B-sides. The single holds the record for being the fastest release straight in to number one and straight out of the charts again over the following couple of weeks.<ref>[http://www.theofficialcharts.com/zoom.php?id=656 The Official UK Charts Company : ALL THE No.1's<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Dickinson performed a solo tour in 1991 before returning to the studio with Iron Maiden for the album ''Fear of the Dark''. Released in 1992, the album was noticeably longer (due to this being Iron Maiden's first album recorded for CD rather than LP) and had several songs which became fan favourites, such as the title track and "Afraid to Shoot Strangers". The disc also featured "From Here to Eternity," the third installment of the 'Charlotte the Harlot' narrative (although some fans will argue that 'Hooks in You' is actually the third installment, making 'From Here to Eternity' the fourth). The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration at all between Harris and Dickinson on songs. 

In 1993, Raising Hell''.

===Winds of change (1994-1999)===

In 1994 the band auditioned hundreds of vocalists, both known and unknown before choosing Wolfsbane. Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor, which ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.<ref>[http://www.roughedge.com/cdreviews/i/ironmaiden.htm#bravetbj Rough Edge: Iron Maiden CD Reviews<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

After a two year hiatus (and three year hiatus from recording - a record for the band at the time) Iron Maiden returned in 1995. Releasing ''The X Factor'', the band faced their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK (debuting at number 8). Chief songwriter Harris was experiencing personal problems at the time with the break-up of his marriage, and many fans and critics feel the album's sound is a reflection of this. 

The album included the 11-minute epic "Sign of the Cross", the band's longest song since "Rime of the Ancient Mariner". It also included "Virus", a new song. "Virus" was released as a single and themed around the backlash the band received for their changing of vocalist. Indeed, Maiden were playing in slightly smaller venues for their The X Factour as a result of this.

The band returned to the studio for ''Virtual XI'', released in 1998. Chart positions of the album were the band's lowest to date,<ref>[http://www.ironmaiden.com/index.php?categoryid=22&p2_articleid=318 Iron Maiden Official Website - Virtual XI<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> failing to reach the one million mark in worldwide sales for the first time in Iron Maiden's history. At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the entire discography of Iron Maiden up to ''Live at Donington'' (which was given a mainstream release for the first time) and released the set.

===Reunion (1999–2005)===
In February 1999, Bayley left the band by mutual consent. At the same time, the band shocked their fans when they announced that both Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith were rejoining the band, and that Janick Gers would remain. Iron Maiden now had three guitarists and a hugely successful reunion tour, The Ed Hunter Tour. This tour also supported the band's newly released computer game ''Ed Hunter''.

Iron Maiden's first studio work after the reunion with Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith came in the form of 2000's ''Brave New World''. The album was met with much critical acclaim. Thematic influences continued with "The Wicker Man"—based on the 1973 British cult film of the same name, and "Brave New World"—title taken from the novel of the same name.

The world tour that followed consisted of well over 100 dates and culminated on Rock in Rio''.

In 2003, Iron Maiden released ''Dance of Death''. As usual, historical and literary influences continued—"Montsegur" in particular being about the Cathar stronghold conquered in 1244 and "Paschendale" relating to a significant battle during World War I. 

Their performance at Westfalenhalle in Dortmund, Germany, as part of the supporting tour, was recorded and released in August 2005 as a live album and DVD, entitled ''Death on the Road''.
