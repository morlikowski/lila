'''Bentley Motors Limited''' is an English manufacturer of luxury rotary aero-engines in Volkswagen Group (Volkswagen AG) (VWAG) of Germany.

==Bentley as a separate company (1919-1931)==
Before World War I W.O. Bentley had been in partnership with his brother H.M. Bentley selling French D.F.P. cars but he had always wanted to design and build his own range of cars bearing his own name.  In August 1919 Bentley Motors Ltd was registered and a chassis, with dummy engine, was exhibited at the London Motor Show in October that year. <ref name=Beaulieu></ref>.  An engine was built and running by December and orders taken for deliveries starting in June 1920. However, development took longer than estimated and the first cars were not ready until September 1921.<ref name=Beaulieu/>

The company was always underfunded and Bentley turned to millionaire Rolls-Royce in 1931. 

===The Bentley Boys===
A group of wealthy British automobile aficionados known as the "steeplechaser George Duller, aviator Glen Kidston, automotive journalist S. C. H. "Sammy" Davis, and Dr. Dudley Benjafield among them) kept the car's reputation for high performance alive. At one point, on a bet, Barnato raced ''Le Train Bleu'' from Cannes to Calais, then by ferry to Dover and finally London, travelling on public highways with normal traffic, and won ; the special-bodied 6½ Litre car became known as the ''Blue Train Bentley''. Thanks to the dedication of this group to serious racing, the company, located at Cricklewood, north London, was noted for its four consecutive victories at the 24 hours of Le Mans from 1927 to 1930. Their greatest competitor at the time, Bugatti, whose lightweight, elegant, but fragile creations contrasted with the Bentley's rugged reliability and durability, referred to them as "the world's fastest lorries". 

===Car models===
The original model was the 3 litre, but as customers put heavier bodies on the chassis a larger 4½ litre model followed.  Perhaps the most iconic model of the period is the 4½ Litre "Blower Bentley", with its distinctive The Avengers'' did drive a Bentley. 

* 1921-1929 3 Litre
* 1926-1930 4½ Litre & "Blower Bentley"
* 1926-1930 6½ Litre
* 1928-1930 6½ Litre Speed Six
* 1930-1931 8 Litre
* 1931 4 Litre

Rolls-Royce had bought Bentley secretly using a company named the British Central Equitable Trust and not even Bentley himself knew the true identity of the purchaser until the deal was completed.<ref name=Beaulieu/> A new company, wholly owned by Rolls-Royce, was formed called Bentley Motors (1931) Ltd with W.O. Bentley himself little more than an employee and he left to join Lagonda in 1935 when his contract was up for renewal. The Cricklewood factory was closed and sold and production moved to the Rolls-Royce works in Derby.

When a new Bentley car appeared in 1933, the 3½&nbsp;Litre, it was a sporting variant of the Rolls-Royce 20/25 and although disappointing some traditional customers, it was well received by many others and even Bentley himself was reported as saying "Taking all things into consideration, I would rather own this Bentley than any other car produced under that name."<ref name=Beaulieu/> 

After World War II, production of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars was moved to an ex-wartime engine factory in Crewe, Cheshire. Bentleys became increasingly a Rolls-Royce without the distinctive grille and with a lower price tag and by the 1970s and early 1980s sales had fallen badly with at one time less than 5% of production carrying the Bentley badge.<ref name=Beaulieu/> 

The parent company failed in 1970 following problems with aero engine development and the car division was floated off to become Rolls-Royce Motors Ltd and remained independent until bought by Vickers in August 1980.
 
In the 1980s Bentley became a separate, high performance car line once again typified by the 1980 Mulsanne. The new sporting image created a new interest in the name and sales as a proportion of output started to rise. In 1986 the Rolls-Royce:Bentley ratio was 60:40 and in 1991 50:50 <ref name=Beaulieu/>.

The Bentley factory in Crewe, Cheshire, is still known in the town by the name "Royce's". For more on Bentley Motors from 1931 to 1998, see Rolls-Royce and Rolls-Royce Motors.

In 1998, Rolls-Royce and Bentley Motors were purchased from V8 engines for the V12 engines for the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph.  The Rolls-Royce name was not included in VW's purchase; it was instead licensed to BMW (for £40 million) by the Rolls-Royce aero engine company. 

BMW and Volkswagen came to an agreement whereby Volkswagen would manufacture both Bentley and Rolls-Royce cars until the end of 2002, whereupon the right to build Rolls-Royce cars would be BMW's alone.  During this period, Volkswagen reduced its reliance on BMW as a supplier: as of 2003, BMW engines are no longer used in Bentley cars.
