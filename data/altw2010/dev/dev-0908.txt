'''''Titan A.E.''''' is a 2000 animated science fiction adventure film from Fox Animation Studios and Twentieth Century Fox. The title refers to the fictional spacecraft that is central to the plot, with ''A.E.'' meaning "After Earth."

The film's animation technique combines traditional hand-drawn animation and extensive use of PG for "action violence, mild sensuality, and brief language." Its working title was ''Planet Ice''.

==Summary==

In the dawn of the human race, who have by now used their advanced technology to reach into the deepest reaches of the Galaxy.  The film opens with protagonist Cale's father stating that mankind's future is forever altered whenever a secret of the universe is unlocked (fire, electricity, nuclear fission, etc.), referring to the newest such secret, codenamed "Project Titan".  Although this discovery has a peaceful purpose, an energy-composed alien race called the Drej see it as a threat to their existence.

In the year 3028 A.D., on the outskirts of Pierce, Colorado, young Cale Tucker is testing out an invention he made at a brook when a flock of panicked birds flies by, indicating an approaching dust storm.  The brook turns violent, breaking Cale's invention and almost causing Cale to lose it.  Sam Tucker, Cale's father, rescues the invention and tells Cale that now is not the time to fix it, because the Drej, having found out about the secret Titan ship, are attacking Earth, in response to which the Earth's President has ordered an immediate evacuation of the planet in case the Earth's Global Defense System (abbreviated as "GDS") fails to drive off the attackers.

While Sam and Cale wait for transport, Cale spots a fleet of V/STOL aircraft heading towards the Spaceport and a squadron of space fighters being deployed to counterattack the Drej.  A hovering jeep, driven by Joseph Korso and Sam's alien friend Tek, takes the Tuckers to the Spaceport, where streams of refugees are boarding spaceships.  The jeep stops near a spaceship reserved for relatives of the scientists involved in Project Titan.  To Cale's horror, Sam chooses to stay behind, giving Cale a ring just as Korso reveals that the Drej have succeeded in breaching the GDS.  Tek takes Cale aboard the ship, while Sam takes the hover jeep to the Titan's secret underground hangar (cleverly concealed by a 20th century barn) and boards the Titan just as the giant hangar doors open.

Earth, meanwhile, is being attacked by the Drej. Their energy beam toward the main title.

Fifteen years later, in 3043, Cale, having been raised and protected by Tek, works on a salvage station built into an asteroid, Tau 14, living a rough life and resenting his father for having disappeared aboard the ''Titan''. Without a true home planet and no colonies of their own, surviving humans have been reduced to space drifters and are constantly bullied by other space-faring races.  Cale experiences this when the aliens working at Tau 14 stop him from entering the express line, forcing him to use the docking port, in which the spaceship ''Valkyrie'' comes.  Cale catches a glimpse of Akima, the ship's pilot, and tries to hide his affections for her by pretending to wash the canopy roof.

Inside, the ship's cockroach-like cook will only serve Cale unappealing alien food. Tek's advice fails to comfort Cale, who is later beaten by two bullies. Korso intervenes and later explains that he is seeking Cale because in the DNA-encrypted ring Sam gave to Cale is a map by which they may find the ''Titan'' and unite all of mankind.

During the conversation, three Drej soldiers enter the salvage station. Korso explains to Cale the Drej wish to destroy him in order to conceal the map. The Drej then start firing at Cale and Korso, but the pair manage to stall their attackers by damaging the gravity generator. Although Cale asks Tek to join them, he insists on staying. Cale and Korso flee towards the kitchen and out the air vents. In the process of hotwiring an escape pod, more Drej units infiltrate the station, and Cale is wounded in the arm and leg. Korso manages to pilot the pod up through a glass roof and flies toward the docking port.

During the flight, the pod suffers considerable damage, including a cracked glass canopy. Korso orders Cale to exhale and kicks through the cracking glass. Using a fire extinguisher to propel themselves through the vacuum of space, the pair manage to enter the ''Valkyrie'''s cargo bay, which then makes a leap into hyperspace before the Drej fighter ships can attack.

With Akima's help, Cale has his blast wounds healed and thus begins his race across the Universe with Korso and his ship and crew, including first mate Preed, a wisecracking, English-accented, rat-like humanoid (an Akrennian); Gune, an eccentric, green-skinned scientist (a Grapoan); and Stith, a tough, female weapons expert who resembles a kangaroo (a Sogowan). 

The map first leads them to a seemingly dead planet, Sesharrim, which is littered with explosive Hydrogen Trees.  Cale, Akima, Korso, and Stith travel to a temple by boat, leaving Gune and Preed to guard the ship and watch for the Drej.  At the temple, the search party meets with the planet's inhabitants, a bird-like race called the Gaol. The Gaol are hostile towards the intruders until Cale explains that he and his friends are on Sesharrim to look for the Titan. The Gaol leader looks at Cale's hand and instructs him to hold his hand up to the planet's broken moon.  Korso and Akima then notice that the map is pointing toward a nebula.

Meanwhile, Preed is distracted from his watchman's task. Gune, paying more attention to the radar, sees Drej fighter ships and immediately alerts Korso. The Gaol facilitate the group's escape after the Drej blow up their boat. Drej shoot down some of the Gaol; during the attack, Akima notices that the Drej are not shooting at Cale, suggesting that they want him alive and not dead as originally thought. Preed and Gune shoot down the many of the remaining Drej ships, but one manages to kidnap Cale and Akima and take them to the Drej mothership. En route, Cale asks Akima why the Drej want to destroy mankind and what mankind did to the Drej that would deserve the loss of Earth. She responds that humanity did nothing to the Drej, but adds that the Drej are afraid of what humanity might become, and narrates her own life's history. 

On the mothership, the Drej Queen uses the map to locate the ''Titan''. She orders Cale imprisoned and Akima to be sent to a slave-trade station. Upon her arrival ther, Korso, Preed, and Stith appear at the station. Preed tries and fails to sneak Korso inside. Akima, meanwhile, is being inspected by the guards who brought her; after they open the pod, she beats them and meets her rescuers.  

Meanwhile, Cale remains in his cell in the Drej mothership, until he discovers that by using two fingers to push apart the energetic membrane imprisoning him, he can escape his cell. When the Drej Queen orders several fighter ships to go to the nebula, Cale makes his way aboard one of the ships and manages to evade the Drej undetected.  

Cale manages to pilot the Drej ship to the ''Valkyrie''. Cale frantically tries to send an encoded sequence to identify himself and prevent confrontation. Korso intercepts the code and allows Cale into the ''Valkyrie''. Cale informs them that the Drej have copied the map, whereupon Gune examines it once more and realizes that it is pointing to a nebula known as the Ice Rings of Tigrin. Later, Korso shows Cale how to pilot the ship and race some Wake Angels (creatures rumored by star pilots to be sources of good luck) for fun.

When they stop at the New Bangkok drifter colony for supplies, Cale and Akima overhear a conversation between Korso and the Drej Queen's hologram, wherein it is revealed that Korso is searching for the ''Titan'' in order to hand it over to the Drej for money. In the ensuing confrontation, Korso aggressively reveals that the Drej have long ago killed Sam Tucker after refusing reveal the location of the Titan, and that he believes that it makes no difference whether or not the human race find another home, because the Drej will continue pursuing them until the humans are destroyed. Cale and Akima flee, and Preed&mdash;having been aware of Korso's intentions all along&mdash;attempts to catch them, only to become stranded on the drifter colony. 

There in New Bangkok, Cale and Akima are helped by the colony's elder women.  When Cale sees a boy inventing a new sport, he remembers the invention he made during Earth's final hour and other memories of his father. Cale and Akima  repair one of the wrecked spacecraft on the station, the ''Phoenix'', and use it to make their way to the Ice Rings of Tigrin, in which the ''Titan'' has been hidden. Korso learns of Akima and Cale's actions and follows the pair, who again manage to evade Korso and at last find the Titan.

Within the ''Titan'', Cale and Akima discover that Cale's father had been one of the main architects in designing the craft. The designers, anticipating the destruction of Earth, gave the ''Titan'' the ability to create a new planet and loaded it with the DNA of every living Earth species for the purpose of repopulating the new world. Unfortunately, according to a holographic message left by Sam Tucker for Cale, the ship's energy has been long since drained and the process cannot be activated.

Korso finds and boards the ''Titan'', accompanied by Preed. Preed leaves Stith and Gune a communication watch, which later turns out to have been a bomb designed to remove the two of them; Gune apparently sacrifices himself to detonate the bomb away from Stith. Korso and Preed confront Cale and Akima. Cale tries to reason with Korso to no avail. Preed turns on Korso, having been promised his life and a substantial amount of money by the Drej in exchange for his killing of Cale, Akima, and Korso. However, Preed hesitates, and a scuffle follows, in which Korso kills Preed by breaking his neck. Korso then fights with Cale before falling over a railing. Cale grabs hold of Korso's hand, trying to save him, while Korso goads him to let him fall to his death. Cale refuses to let go, but Korso slips from his grip and falls. However, Korso survives by hanging onto a rope. Akima and Cale, joined by Stith, then work together to defend the ''Titan'' against the impending Drej attack. Cale realizes that the energy comprising the Drej and their ships may be used to power up the ''Titan's'' systems; therefore they work to bring the vessel online, until they see that one of the circuits is jammed.

As Cale dons a space suit, and Akima and Stith use the ''Titan'''s guns to provide cover for Cale. The Drej ships destroy the guns and threaten Cale until Gune, who has survived the explosion, pilots the ''Valkyrie'' to fight the Drej ships. He manages to damage one, which crashes and pins Cale against the ''Titan's'' outer wall.

'''''Titan A.E.''''' ou '''''Titan après la Terre''''' au 2000.

Bien que novateur et bénéficiant d'une réalisation soignée (il s'agit d'un mélange d'images de synthèse et d'animation traditionnelle en 2D), le film fut un échec financier, et entraîna la fermeture de Fox Animation Studios.

==Synopsis==

En l'an 3028, l'humanité fait une découverte capitale dans le domaine de la terraformation ; ce projet est baptisé "Titan", et ouvre de nouvelles possibilités extraordinaires. Mais une race de créatures extraterrestres composées d'énergie pure, les Drej, y voient au contraire une menace pour leur suprématie, et en réponse, attaquent et détruisent la Terre, ne laissant qu'une poignée d'humains condamnés à errer dans le cosmos.

Cale Tucker, un jeune garçon, fils de l'initiateur du projet Titan, est séparé de son père lors de l'exode, et grandit sur Tau-14, une colonie de ferrailleurs misérable. 15 ans plus tard, il est devenu un jeune adulte aigri, hâbleur et en rébellion permanente contre l'autorité. Lors d'une rixe avec deux brutes locales, Cale est secouru par Joseph Korso, un ancien militaire qui travailla autrefois aux côtés de son père ; ce dernier ayant pris la fuite à bord du vaisseau Titan lors de l'attaque de la Terre, la mission de Korso consiste à retrouver sa trace, car cet engin spatial constitue peut-être l'ultime espoir d'une humanité décadente...

Après un moment d'hésitation, Cale accepte finalement de se joindre à lui, et rejoint son équipage hétéroclite, formé de Preed, l'Akrénnien sournois et beau-parleur, Stith, la Mantrine experte en armement impétueuse mais loyale, Gune, l'astrogateur gaffeur et fantasque, et enfin Akima, une ravissante et intrépide pilote... 

Mais la quête du Titan ne sera pas de tout repos, sans compter que les Drej sont à leur trousses.
